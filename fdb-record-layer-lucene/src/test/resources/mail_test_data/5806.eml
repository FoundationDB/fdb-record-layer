firmament and even beyond the stars composing the Great Bear, the other on =
the opposite side=20

under the earth in the regions of the south. Round these pivots (termed in =
Greek [Greek: poloi]) as=20

centres, like those of a turning lathe, she formed the circles in which the=
 heaven passes on its=20

everlasting way. In the midst thereof, the earth and sea naturally occupy t=
he central point.  3. It=20

follows from this natural arrangement that the central point in the north i=
s high above the earth,=20

while on the south, the region below, it is beneath the earth and consequen=
tly hidden by it.=20

Furthermore, across the middle, and obliquely inclined to the south, there =
is a broad circular belt=20

composed of the twelve signs, whose stars, arranged in twelve equivalent di=
visions, represent=20

each a shape which nature has depicted. And so with the firmament and the o=
ther constellations,=20

they move round the earth and sea in glittering array, completing their orb=
its according to the=20

spherical shape of the heaven.  4. They are all visible or invisible accord=

sumptuous dinner, had got=20

into their carriages and driven away, I went into the house to look at the =
remains of the feast.=20

Glancing into the drawing-room from the passage, I saw my uncle and my moth=
er. My uncle, with=20

his hands behind his back, was walking nervously up and down close to the w=
all, shrugging his=20

shoulders. Mother, exhausted and looking much thinner, was sitting on the s=
ofa and watching his=20

movements with heavy eyes.  "Excuse me, sister, but this won't do at all," =
my uncle grumbled,=20

wrinkling up his face. "I introduced the governor to you, and you didn't of=
fer to shake hands. You=20

covered him with confusion, poor fellow! No, that won't do.... Simplicity i=
s a very good thing, but=20

there must be limits to it.... Upon my soul! And then that dinner! How can =
one give people such=20

things? What was that mess, for instance, that they served for the fourth c=
ourse?"  "That was duck=20

with sweet sauce..." mother answered softly.  "Duck! Forgive me, sister, bu=
t... but here I've got=20

of the signs are passing along with the heaven above the earth, the other s=
ix are moving under the=20

earth and hidden by its shadow. But there are always six of them making the=
ir way above the=20

earth; for, corresponding to that part of the last sign which in the course=
 of its revolution has to=20

sink, pass under the earth, and become concealed, an equivalent part of the=
 sign opposite to it is=20

obliged by the law of their common revolution to pass up and, having comple=
ted its circuit, to=20

emerge out of the darkness into the light of the open space on the other si=
de. This is because the=20

rising and setting of both are subject to one and the same power and law.  =
5. While these signs,=20

twelve in number and occupying each one twelfth part of the firmament, stea=
dily revolve from east=20

to west, the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, as well as Mars, Jupiter, and S=
aturn, differing from=20

one another in the magnitude of their orbits as though their courses were a=
t different points in a=20

flight of steps, pass through those signs in just the opposite direction, f=
rom west to east in the=20

firmament. The moon makes her circuit of the heaven in twenty-eight days pl=
us about an hour, and=20

with her return to the sign from which she set forth, completes a lunar mon=
th.  6. The sun takes a=20

full month to move across the space of one sign, that is, one twelfth of th=
e firmament.=20

Consequently, in twelve months he traverses the spaces of the twelve signs,=
 and, on returning to=20

the sign from which he began, completes the period of a full year. Hence, t=
he circuit made by the=20

moon thirteen times in twelve months, is measured by the sun only once in t=
he same number of=20

months. But Mercury and Venus, their paths wreathing around the sun's rays =
as their centre,=20

retrograde and delay their movements, and so, from the nature of ill!"  My =
uncle made a sour,=20

tearful face, and went on:  "It was the devil sent that governor! As though=
 I wanted his visit! Pff!...=20

heartburn! I can't work or sleep... I am completely out of sorts.... And I =
can't understand how you=20

can live here without anything to do... in this boredom! Here I've got a pa=
in coming under my=20

shoulder-blade!..."  My uncle frowned, and walked about more rapidly than e=
ver.  "Brother," my=20

mother inquired softly, "what would it cost to go abroad?"  "At least three=
 thousand..." my uncle=20

answered in a tearful voice. "I would go, but where am I to get it? I haven=
't a farthing. Pff!...=20

heartburn!"  My uncle stopped to look dejectedly at the grey, overcast pros=
pect from the window,=20

and began pacing to and fro again.  A silence followed.... Mother looked a =
long while at the ikon,=20

pondering something, then she began crying, and said:  "I'll give you the t=
hree thousand,=20

brother...."   Three days later the majestic boxes went off to the station,=
 and the privy councillor=20

drove off after them. As he said good-bye to mother he shed tears, and it w=
as a long time before=20

he took his lips from her hands, but when he got into his carriage his face=
 beamed with childlike=20

pleasure.... Radiant and happy, he settled himself comfortably, kissed his =
hand to my mother, who=20

was crying, and all at once his eye was caught by me. A look of the utmost =
astonishment came=20

into his face.  "What boy is this?" he asked.  My mother, who had declared =
my uncle's coming was=20

a piece of luck for which I must thank God, was bitterly mortified at this =
question. I was in no mood=20

for questions. I looked at my uncle's happy face, and for some reason I fel=
t fearfully sorry for him. I=20

could not resist jumping up to the carriage and hugging that frivolous man,=
 weak as all men are.=20

Looking into=20

recognized from Venus. When she is following the sun, she makes her appeara=
nce in the sky after=20

 At other times she=20

precedes him, rising before day-break, and is named the Morning  "Uncle, ha=
ve you ever been in=20

a battle?"  "Ah, the dear boy..." laughed my uncle, kissing me. "A charming=
 boy, upon my soul!=20

How natural, how living it all is, upon my soul!..."  The carriage set off.=
... I looked after him, and=20

long afterwards that farewell "upon my soul" was ringing in my ears.      T=
