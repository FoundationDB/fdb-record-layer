cars as circumstances allowed.  Across No Man's land on this November morni=
ng, from the=20

northern end of France to the southern, were passing the victorious allied =
armies, three hundred=20

thousand American troops led by Pershing to victory, and an equal or greate=
r number of French=20

and British.  In the car with Sonya the American girls had but little to sa=
y to one another during the=20

first part of their journey. Not only was the land before them desolate bey=
ond description, but filled=20

with tragic memories.  Early in the afternoon, reaching the edge of a littl=
e French town, the Red=20

Cross automobiles stopped. The occupants were in no great hurry to move for=
ward. In advance=20

the cavalry had swept on to prepare the way, but the infantry was going ahe=
ad slowly and would=20

encamp for the night. This division of the Red Cross intended keeping in th=
e background so that in=20

case the men became ill, they could drop out and be overtaken by nurses and=
 physicians.  The=20

girls were glad of the rest and also extraordinarily hungry, having spent t=
he greater part of the=20

night and every moment since daylight in preparation for the advance.  Thei=
r three cars had=20

stopped in front of a small farmhouse on the outskirts of the town.  Approa=
ching the house, Sonya=20

and Dr. Raymond believed it to be empty. The blinds were closed, the pathwa=
y to the front door=20

untrodden. Yet it had once been a gay little house of French grey with brig=
ht blue shutters.  A=20

knock at the door and both Sonya and the young physician thought they heard=
 scurrying noises=20

inside. Yet knocking again there was no reply.  "Shall I try pushing the li=
ttle front door open, Mrs.=20

Clark? It is pretty cold eating outside. I can't quite understand the situa=
tion. The French people=20

know we are their friends; they have been told to expect nothing but kindne=
ss and consideration=20

from us. Do look, already the French civilians are coming out from the vill=
age to welcome us. Our=20

little house is surely uninhabited or it would not be so inhospitable."  Fo=
llowing Dr. Raymond's=20

suggestion, Sonya turned.  Standing not far away in a group were the six Re=
d Cross nurses for=20

whom she felt especially responsible, Nona Davis and Mildred Thornton, the =
two girls who were=20

her intimate and devoted friends and who had made exceptional sacrifices to=
 remain in Europe=20

now that the war was ended. There were also the two comparatively new nurse=
s, Ruth Carroll and=20

Theodosia Thompson, and Bianca Zoli. The sixth girl was the Red Cross nurse=
