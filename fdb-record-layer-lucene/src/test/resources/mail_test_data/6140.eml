at once jumped to the conclusion that this was the "deevil bar" who had com=
e to eat them all up,=20

like the wolf in "Red Riding Hood."  Women and children screamed and rushed=
 for a farther corner=20

of the church, while the more hysterical fainted.  Even strong men were for=
 a second startled.  But=20

from his eminence at the altar Father Gaspard saw their mistake and soon re=
assured them.=20

Meanwhile, the innocent cause of all the disturbance had been as much scare=
d by the team as=20

had the half-witted boy by him, and was making for the deep woods at his be=
st pace.  One night,=20

early in July, Alec Pierre, a wood-chopper, came to the village with a star=
tling story.  He had been=20

chopping two or three miles back in the heavy timber.  His own home was clo=
ser to the primeval=20

forest than any other of the many straggling farmhouses.  He had taken his =
dinner, going and=20

coming at morning and evening.  Each noon he went to a cool spring which he=
 knew of, to eat his=20

lunch.  This noon he had gone as usual, only to discover that some one had =
gotten ahead of him.=20

There by the spring, sitting upon his haunches, was an enormous black bear.=
  In his paws he was=20

holding the coffee-bottle, looking at it intently, while his countenance pl=
ainly bespoke satisfaction=20

with the discovery.  While the woodsman was wondering what was the best thi=
ng to do, the bear=20

raised the bottle to his mouth, and biting upon the cork with his teeth, pu=
lled it out.  Then he put=20

the nose of the bottle in his mouth and drank the contents with as much eas=
e as if he had been=20

the real owner.  "I so scart I jes' stan' there an' say nutting.  He eat my=
 doughnut, he eat my pie.=20

He act jes' like folks.  Pretty soon I keep on looking some more an' I see =
down in his har, round=20

hees neck one peeg collar, jes' like a dog.  "Heem one beeg deevil.  I so s=
cart when he drink out=20

uv de bottle, I no say nutting.  He eat my pie, I no say nutting.  I 'fraid=
 he take my gun by the tree=20

an' shoot me.  By gar.  "By and by he go way and I go up an' look.  Perhaps=
 I t'ink I been=20

dreaming.  So I pinch my lage an' it hurt, an' then I look aroun' an' there=
 bar-track beeg as snow-

shoe.  "Eet so queer I t'ink heaps an' heaps.  Then pretty soon I t'ink he =
some puddy tame bar run=20

away.  He break he chain.  That why heem collar.  I say to myself, no chain=
, no collar.  "Heem one=20

tame bar run away.  He know how do treeks.  I catch heem in one small log-h=
ouse I beeld.  When=20

circus come round next week, or two, I seel heem get pig money."  Those vil=
lagers who listened to=20

Alec's tale agreed that his reasoning was good, but most of them characteri=
zed the story as one=20

big lie, and thought no more of it.  But not so Alec.  He had seen that day=
 in the wood the most=20

wonderful sight of his life, a bear eating like folks, and he could not get=
 out of his head the idea=20

that the capture of that bear meant a fortune to the trapper who should acc=
omplish the feat.=20

Perhaps, there was also some superstition linked with his curiosity, for ne=
arly all Canucks are=20

superstitious; but at any rate the very next day he set about building the =
trap that should capture=20

the "deevil bar," and make skeptical. There are difficulties enough without=
 imagining any. We have=20

no money, and all our sources of supply are drained; but we have the inspir=
ation of a sacred=20

cause, we have you=E2=80=94we may gain others=E2=80=94and, at any rate, the=
 French are no longer at Rome.=E2=80=9D=20

CHAPTER 33 =E2=80=9CThe Goodwood Cup, my lord=E2=80=94the Doncaster. This p=
air of flagons for his highness=20

the Khedive=E2=80=94something quite new=E2=80=94yes, parcel-gilt, the only =
style now=E2=80=94it gives relief to=20

design=E2=80=94yes, by Monti, a great man, hardly inferior to Flaxman, if a=
t all. Flaxman worked for=20

Rundell and Bridge in the old days=E2=80=94one of the principal causes of t=
heir success. Your lordship=E2=80=99s=20

gold service was supplied by Rundell and Bridge. Very fine service indeed, =
much by=20

Flaxman=E2=80=94nothing of that kind seen now.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI never d=
id see it,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. He was replying to Mr.=20

Ruby, a celebrated jeweller and goldsmith, in a celebrated street, who had =
saluted him when he=20



had entered the shop, and called the attention of Lothair to a group of tre=
asures of art.  =E2=80=9CStrange,=E2=80=9D=20

said Mr. Ruby smiling. =E2=80=9CIt is in the next room, if your lordship wo=
uld like to see it. I think your=20

lordship should see your gold service. Mr. Putney Giles ordered it here to =
be examined and put in=20

order.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI should like to see it very much,=E2=80=9D said =
Lothair, =E2=80=9Cthough I came to speak to you about=20

something else.=E2=80=9D  And so Lothair, following Mr. Ruby into an inner =
apartment, had the gratification,=20

for the first time, of seeing his own service of gold plate laid out in com=
pleteness, and which had=20

been for some time exhibited to the daily admiration of that favored portio=
n of the English people=20

who frequent the brilliant and glowing counters of Mr. Ruby.  Not that Loth=
air was embarrassed by=20

their presence at this moment. The hour of their arrival had not yet come. =
Business had not long=20

commenced when Lothair entered the shop, somewhat to the surprise of its ma=
ster. Those who=20

know Bond Street only in the blaze of fashionable hours can form but an imp=
erfect conception of=20

its matutinal charm when it is still shady and fresh=E2=80=94when there are=
 no carriages, rarely a cart, and=20

passers-by gliding about on real business. One feels as in some Continental=
 city. Then there are=20

time and opportunity to look at the shops; and there is no street in the wo=
rld that can furnish such=20

a collection, filled with so many objects of beauty, curiosity, and interes=
t. The jewellers and=20

goldsmiths and dealers in rare furniture, porcelain, and cabinets, and Fren=
ch pictures, have long=20

fixed upon Bond Street as their favorite quarter, and are not chary of disp=
laying their treasures;=20

though it may be a question whether some of the magazines of fancy food=E2=
=80=94delicacies culled from=20

all the climes and regions of the globe=E2=80=94particularly at the matin h=
our, may not, in their picturesque=20

variety, be the most attractive. The palm, perhaps, would be given to the f=
ish-mongers, with their=20

exuberant exhibitions, grouped with skill, startling often with strange for=
ms, dazzling with prismatic=20

tints, and breathing the invigorating redolence of the sea.  =E2=80=9CWell,=
 I like the service,=E2=80=9D said Lothair,=20

=E2=80=9Cand am glad, as you tell me, that its fashion has come=20


_
The trap upon which Alec relied for the capture of Black Bruin was a pen-tr=
ap.  It was made in the=20

following manner:  Alec looked about until he discovered four trees, growin=
g in two pairs ten or=20

twelve feet apart.  These sets of pillars were to be the four corners of th=
e trap.  He then set to work=20

to cut small logs eight or ten inches in diameter.  These were a couple of =
feet longer than the pen=20

was to be and were built up one above another on the inside of the pillars,=
 being held in place=20

against the trees by strong stakes driven deep into the ground.  In this ma=
nner the two sides and=20

the back end of the pen-trap were formed.  The top was covered with poles, =
weighted down with=20

stones. The trap-door, which was at the front, was made of plank and slid u=
p and down in a=20

groove.  When it was raised, it was held in place by a cord which passed ov=
er the top of the pen-

trap and down on the back side, finally attaching to a trigger connecting w=
ith a spindle inside the=20

pen, at the farther end.  The bait was to be placed on this spindle and a t=
ug upon it would let go=20

the trap-door.  As this was weighted with stones, it came down necessity fo=
r ordering a new one. I=20

do not myself much care for plate. I like flowers and porcelain on a table,=
 and I like to see the=20

guests. However, I suppose it is all right, and I must use it. It was not a=
bout plate that I called; I=20

wanted to speak to you about pearls.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D said M=
r. Ruby, and his face brightened; and, ushering=20

Lothair to some glass cases, he at the same time provided his customer with=
 a seat.  =E2=80=9CSomething=20

like that?=E2=80=9D said Mr. Ruby, who by this time had slid into his prope=
r side of the counter, and was=20

unlocking the glass cases; =E2=80=9Csomething like that?=E2=80=9D and he pl=
aced before Lothair a string of pretty=20

pearls with a diamond clasp. =E2=80=9CWith the earrings, twenty-five hundre=
d,=E2=80=9D he added; and then,=20

observing that Lothair did not seem enchanted, he said, =E2=80=9CThis is so=
mething quite new,=E2=80=9D and he=20

carelessly pushed toward Lothair a magnificent necklace of turquoises and b=
rilliants.  It was=20

impossible not to admire it=E2=80=94the arrangement was so novel and yet of=
 such good taste; but, though=20

its price was double that of the pearl necklace, Mr. Ruby did not seem to w=
ish to force attention to=20

it, for he put in Lothair=E2=80=99s hands=20


_
to be inside was caught in a prison of great strength.  It took Alec two da=
ys to build the trap, and=20

when it was finished he carefully removed all chips and traces of his carpe=
ntering.  Usually a bear=20

will not go near anything so new and apparently man-made as a green pen-tra=
p.  So Alec did not=20

expect success for several days. In the meantime he took pains to bait Blac=
k Bruin and keep him=20

in the vicinity by placing near the spring meat and other food, that his wo=
odsman's instinct told him=20

would be appreciated by a hungry bear.  He did not forget an occasional bot=
tle of coffee.  Although=20

he did not see the bear again for several days, yet the meat and the coffee=
 always disappeared,=20

which was pretty good evidence that he was near by.  Black Bruin heard Alec=
 hacking and hewing=20

at the trap, but did not consider it anything out of the ordinary.  This qu=
eer creature was always=20

hacking and hewing at the trees.  He had often seen his handiwork piled up =
in long straight piles.=20

Once for mere amusement he had scattered a pile in every direction.  When h=
e at last came=20

suddenly upon the pen-trap one day, after it had been baited for some time,=
 he gave a surprised=20

grunt and backed off a few feet to get a better view.  It looked very queer=
 and very suspicious.  He=20

was quite sure that it had not been there a week ago, for he was well acqua=
inted with the region.=20

It was made of trees, but trees usually grew upright, and they always had l=
imbs upon them.  The=20

ends of the logs were hacked and green like the sticks in the wood-pile.  B=
lack Bruin circled=20

around and around the pen-trap, gradually drawing nearer and nearer to it. =
 Finally he came close=20

enough to peep in at the the world, and set in a style that was perfectly r=
avishing.  =E2=80=9CThe setting is=20

from the Campana collection,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Ruby. =E2=80=9CThey certainl=
y understood things in those days, but=20

I can say that, so far as mere workmanship is concerned, this quite equals =
them. I have made one=20

for the empress. Here is a black pearl, very rare, pear-shape, and set in G=
olconda diamonds=E2=80=94two=20

thousand guineas=E2=80=94it might be suspended to a necklace, or worn as a =
locket. This is pretty,=E2=80=9D and=20

he offered to Lothair a gigantic sapphire in brilliants and in the form of =
a bracelet.  =E2=80=9CThe finest=20

sapphire I know is in this ring,=E2=80=9D added Mr. Ruby, and he introduced=
 his visitor to a tray of precious=20

rings. =E2=80=9CI have a pearl bracelet here that your lordship might like =
to see,=E2=80=9D and he placed before=20

Lothair a case of fifty bracelets, vying with each other in splendor.  =E2=
=80=9CBut what I want,=E2=80=9D said Lothair,=20

=E2=80=9Care pearls.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI understand,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Rub=
y. =E2=80=9CThis is a curious thing,=E2=80=9D and he took out a paper=20

packet. =E2=80=9CThere!=E2=80=9D he said, opening it and throwing it before=
 Lothair so carelessly that some of the=20

stones ran over the glass covering of the counter. =E2=80=9CThere, that is =
a thing, not to be seen every=20

day=E2=80=94packet of diamonds, bought of an Indian prince, and sent by us =
to be cut and polished at=20

Amsterdam=E2=80=94nothing can be done in that way except there=E2=80=94and =
just returned=E2=80=94nothing very=20

remarkable as to size, but all of high quality=E2=80=94some fine stones=E2=
=80=94that for example,=E2=80=9D and he=20

touched one with the long nail of his little finger; =E2=80=9Cthat is worth=
 seven hundred guineas, the whole=20

packet worth perhaps ten thousand pounds.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CVery interesti=
ng,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cbut what I want are=20

pearls. That necklace which you have shown me is like the=20


_
smelled the calf's head that hung from the spindle.  Meat had also been rub=
bed about the=20

doorway, which was most tantalizing, especially as Black Bruin had not had =
any for three days.=20

He licked the particles of meat that still stuck to the logs about the door=
way and then started to go=20

in, but it seemed dark and suspicious; beside there was a very faint sugges=
tion of man-scent=20

inside.  Outside the rain and the wind had obliterated all foreign scents. =
 Man-scent meant danger.=20

Man was no friend of the wild creatures, so Black Bruin backed out and very=
 reluctantly went=20

away.  When Alec visited his trap the next day, he did not go near enough t=
o see the bear-tracks=20

in the fresh dirt about the door, for he did not care to leave fresh man-sc=
ent in its vicinity; so he=20

was rather discouraged with the failure of his efforts.  The trap had now b=
een set for a week and=20

nothing apparently had been near it.  The next day Black Bruin again visite=
d the trap, but his=20

suspicions were still keen and as he had killed a wood-chuck that morning, =
his appetite was not=20

ravenous, so he again left the bait untasted.  The third time that he came =
near the spot, which=20

somehow had a fascination for him, he smelled a new and bewitching odor, on=
e that a bear is=20

almost powerless to resist.  It brought back to his mind that old tantalizi=
ng picture of the row of=20

white beehives in the back yard of the farmhouse.  The scent made his mouth=
 want pearls, such=20

as you see them in Italian pictures=E2=80=94Titians and Giorgiones=E2=80=94=
such as a Queen of Cyprus would=20

wear. I want ropes of pearls.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D said Mr. Ruby=
, =E2=80=9CI know what your lordship means. Lady=20

Bideford had something of that kind. She very much deceived us=E2=80=94alwa=
ys told us her necklace=20

must be sold at her death, and she had very bad health. We waited, but when=
 she went, poor lady,=20

it was claimed by the heir, and is in chancery at this very moment. The Jus=
tinianis have ropes of=20

pearls=E2=80=94Madame Justiniani of Paris, I have been told, gives a rope t=
o every one of her children=20

when they marry=E2=80=94but there is no expectation of a Justiniani parting=
 with any thing. Pearls are=20

troublesome property, my lord. They require great care; they want both air =
and exercise; they must=20

be worn frequently; you cannot lock them up. The Duchess of Havant has the =
finest pearls in this=20

country, and I told her grace, =E2=80=98Wear them whenever you can; wear th=
em at breakfast,=E2=80=99 and her=20

grace follows my advice=E2=80=94she does wear them at breakfast. I go down =
to Havant Castle every=20

year to see her grace=E2=80=99s pearls, and I wipe every one of them myself=
, and let them lie on a sunny=20

bank in the garden, in a westerly wind, for hours and days together. Their =
complexion would have=20

been ruined had it not been for this treatment. Pearls are like girls, my l=
ord=E2=80=94they require quite as=20

much attention.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen you cannot give me what I want?=E2=
=80=9D said Lothair.=20
