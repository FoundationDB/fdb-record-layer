parenthesis after all, and the old truth remains widened, not overthrown by=
 it. The psalmist knew=20

that all being and action had their origin in God. He saw the last links of=
 the chain, and knew that it=20

was rivetted to the throne of God, though the intermediate links were unsee=
n; and even the fact=20

that there were any was not present to his mind. We know something of these=
; but the first and the=20

last our most refined circles."  "I suppose," said I, "now that your social=
 and financial position are=20

secured, you will run for Congress."  "Sir," said Mr Wog, sternly, "when I =
explained to you the=20

nature of my commercial success, it was to convey to you the idea of my sma=
rtness, not of my=20

meanness. I am not aware of having said anything to lead you to suppose tha=
t I could so far=20

degrade myself as to=20


_
the first and the last to us also. To us as to him, the silent splendour of=
 noonday speaks of God,=20

and the nightly heavens pour the soft radiance of His "excellent name over =
all the earth." The=20

tempest is His voice, and the wildest commotions in nature and among men br=
eak in obedient=20

waves around His pillared throne.    "Well roars the storm to those who hea=
r    A deeper voice=20

across the storm!"  There still remains one other psalm which may be used a=
s illustrating the early=20

life of David. The Twenty-third psalm is coloured throughout by the remembr=
ances of his youthful=20

occupation, even if its actual composition is of a later date. Some critics=
, indeed, think that the=20

mention in the last verse of "the house of the Lord" compels the suppositio=
n of an origin=20

subsequent to the building of the Temple; but the phrase in question need n=
ot have anything to do=20

with tabernacle or temple, and is most naturally accounted for by the prece=
ding image of God as=20

the Host who feasts His servants at His table. There are no other notes of =
time in the psalm,=20

unless, with some commentators, we see an allusion in that image of the fur=
nished table to the=20

seasonable hospitality of the Gileadite chieftains during David's flight be=
fore Absalom (2 Sam. xvii.=20

27-29)--a reference which appears prosaic and flat. The absence of traces o=
f distress and sorrow--

so constantly present in the later songs--may be urged with some force in f=
avour of the early date;=20

and if we follow one of the most valuable commentators (Hupfeld) in transla=
ting all the verbs as=20

futures, and so make the whole a hymn of hope, we seem almost obliged to su=
ppose that we have=20

here the utterance of a youthful spirit, which ventured to look forward, be=
cause it first looked=20

upward. In any case, the psalm is a transcript of thoughts that had been bo=
rn and cherished in=20

many a meditative hour among the lonely hills of Bethlehem. It is the echo =
of the shepherd life. We=20

see in it the incessant care, the love to his helpless charge, which was ex=
pressed in and=20

deepened by all his toil for them. He had to think for their simplicity, to=
 fight for their=20

defencelessness, to find their pasture, to guard them while they lay politi=
cian."  "What a comfort it=20

will be," I remarked, "when the rotten old despotisms of Europe, and the po=
litical ambitions that=20

belong to them, shall have crumbled to the dust, and when we have instead t=
he free and glorious=20

institutions of the West, which seem to offer nothing to tempt a man from t=
he ennobling pursuit of=20

hard cash!" But Mr Wog failed to appreciate the force of my remark, as he w=
as intently=20

endeavouring to catch the purport of a very private conversation carried on=
 by a group a few yards=20

off, towards which he gradually edged, in the hope that he might be able ei=
ther to acquire or impart=20

some interesting information.  Spiffy looked more humbled and crestfallen t=
han I had ever seen=20

him; but remembering that he had still a score unsettled, in consequence of=
 the remark which Mr=20

Wog's arrival had interrupted, he said, maliciously,--  "By the way, what i=
s the real state of the=20

case about you and Lady Ursula? I don't apologise for asking, as I am sure =
you must want the=20

right version to be known both for your sake and hers."  "The right version=
 is simply that I neither=20

am at this moment nor ever have been engaged to Lady Ursula."  "Then why di=
d you tell Helter=20

you were, and why are you pulling the family through their difficulties?"  =
"Because Helter was=20

provoking me almost as much as you are, though I admit that is no reason wh=
y I should not have=20

told the truth. As for the motives which actuate me in meddling in those pe=
cuniary transactions in=20

which you and Lady Broadhem are implicated, I am afraid you would not under=
stand them if I were=20

to attempt to explain them. It is a complicated business altogether. We sha=
ll get through it most=20

satisfactorily by each minding our own share of it," I said significantly, =
and I walked off to a table=20

where Broadhem was writing letters. I had not seen him since my interview w=
ith his sister. He=20



looked gloomy and discontented, and gave me a cold glance of recognition. "=
How are you,=20

Broadhem? I suppose Lady Ursula told you the result of our conversation," I=
 said in a low tone,=20

and took a chair by his side.  He nodded sulkily, and showed a disposition =
to cut me. My last few=20

words with Spiffy had not left=20


_
sometimes to use his staff in order to force their heedlessness with loving=
 violence past tempting=20

perils; sometimes to guide them through gloomy gorges, where they huddled c=
lose at his heels;=20

sometimes to smite the lion and the bear that prowled about the fold--but a=
ll was for their good and=20

meant their comfort. And thus he has learned, in preparation for his own ki=
ngdom, the inmost=20

meaning of pre-eminence among men--and, more precious lesson still, thus he=
 has learned the=20

very heart of God. Long before, Jacob had spoken of Him as the "Shepherd of=
 Israel;" but it was=20

reserved for David to bring that sweet and wonderful name into closer relat=
ions with the single=20

soul; and, with that peculiar enthusiasm of personal reliance, and recognit=
ion of God's love to the=20

individual which stamps all his psalms, to say "The Lord is my Shepherd." T=
hese dumb=20

companions of his, in their docility to his guidance, and absolute trust in=
 his care, had taught him=20

the secret of peace in helplessness, of patience in ignorance. The green st=
rips of sharply, "Well, I=20

hope both you and Lady Broadhem will contradict the perfectly unfounded rep=
ort you were the=20

means of spreading. I need not say that I shall do my share, and I trust th=
at you will profit by the=20

lesson you have received not to interfere in matters of this sort again."  =
"I tell you what it is, Frank,"=20

said Broadhem, who felt that somehow I was more to blame than he was, but w=
ho was taken=20

aback by my turning the tables upon him so suddenly; "if it was not that du=
elling is exploded, and=20

that it would be against my principles at any rate, I would shoot you."  "B=
y way of helping to clear=20

your property of its encumbrances," I added. "Your mother has put everythin=
g into my hands, and I=20

can do pretty much what I please with the whole family."  "Can you?" said B=
roadhem, with a grim=20

smile. "The only thing that consoles me in the whole affair is, that you wi=
ll find that you have got a=20

little score to settle with my mother. If you knew her as well as I do, you=
 would not anticipate the=20

interview with pleasure. As for=20
