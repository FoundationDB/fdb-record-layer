The Khou,     in obeying the orders of the god, none the less preserved the=

been described to him, and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an i=
mmense feudal castle.=20

"Oh! oh!" he said, "I fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of=
 Orleans. Can Porthos=20

have negotiated for it with the Duc de Longueville?"  "Faith!" exclaimed Pl=
anchet, "here's land in=20

good condition; if it belongs to Monsieur Porthos I wish him joy."  "Zounds=
!" cried D'Artagnan,=20

"don't call him Porthos, nor even Vallon; call him De Bracieux or De Pierre=
fonds; thou wilt knell out=20

damnation to my mission otherwise."  As he approached the castle=20

the towers, though solid and as if built yesterday, were open and broken. O=

the subjects of the Pharaohs were not very much inclined to the Spiritism o=

pursued his road, followed by Planchet at the same pace.  In ten minutes D'=
Artagnan reached the=20

end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an i=
