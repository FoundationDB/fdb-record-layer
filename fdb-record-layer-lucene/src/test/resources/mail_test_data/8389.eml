A burst of laughter was the answer, but finished with a groan. D'Artagnan had, with his sword, cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed.  At the same time Porthos and his adversary fired _
the first night of Samvatsara, the first year of the quinquennial     age." This passage clearly shows 

that the quinquennial age which,     according to the sixth verse of the _Jyotisha_, begins on the 

1st     of Magha (January-February), once began on the 15th of Phalguna     (February-March). 

Now when the 15th of Phalguna of the first year     called Samvatsara of the quinquennial age 

begins, the moon,     according to the _Jyotisha_, is in 3/4th of the Uttar Phalguni,     and the sun 

in 1/4th of Purva Bhadrapada. Hence the position of     the four principal points on the ecliptic was 

then as follows:      The winter solstice in 3 deg.29' of Purva Bhadrapada.      The vernal equinox in 

the beginning of Mrigashirsha.      The summer solstice in 10 of Purva Phalguni.      The autumnal 

equinox in the middle of Jyeshtha.      The vernal equinoctial point, we  "Who goes there?" was 

asked a second time. "Not a step forward, or you're dead men."  "Stuff!" cried Porthos, almost 

choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit. "Stuff and nonsense; we have 

seen plenty of dead men in our time."  Hearing these words, the two shadows blockaded the road 

and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms.  "Back!" shouted D'Artagnan, 

"or you are dead!"  Two shots were the reply to this threat; but the assailants attacked their foes 

with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them; a third pistol-shot was heard, aimed by 

D'Artagnan, and one of his adversaries fell. As for Porthos, he assaulted the foe with such 

violence that, although his sword was thrust aside, the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell 

about ten steps from it.  "Finish, Mouston, finish the work!" cried Porthos. And

beginning of Krittika in 1421 B.C.; and from the beginning of     Krittika to that of Mrigashirsha, 

was, in consequence, 1421 +     26-2/3 x 72 = 1421 + 1920 = 3341 B.C., supposing the rate of 

_precession_ to be 50 deg. a year. When we take the rate to be 3 deg.20"     in 247 years, the 

time comes up to 1516 + 1960.7 = 3476.7 B.C.      When the winter solstice by its retrograde 

motion coincided after     that with the beginning of Purva Bhadrapada, then the commencement 

of the quinquennial age was changed from the 15th to the 1st of     Phalguna (February-March). 

This change took place 240 years after     the date of the above observation, that is, in 3101 B.C. 

This date     is most important, as from it an era beside his friend, who had already begun a fresh 

pursuit.  "Well?" said Porthos.  "I've broken my man's skull," cried D'Artagnan. "And you----"  "I've 

only thrown the fellow down, but hark!"  Another shot of a carbine was heard. It was Mousqueton, 

who was obeying his master's command.  "On! on!" cried D'Artagnan; "all goes well! we have the 

first throw."  "Ha! ha!" answered Porthos, "behold, other players appear."  And in fact, two other 

cavaliers made their appearance, detached, as it seemed, from the principal group; they again 

disputed the road.  This time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak.  "Stand 

aside!" he cried; "stand off the road!"  "What do you want?" asked a voice.  "The duke!" Porthos
