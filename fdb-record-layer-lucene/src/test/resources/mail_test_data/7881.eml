would be the total toll of the accident and that the premature blast had done no damage to the 

tunnel, the two Titus brothers began to consider matters.  Tom, Mr. Damon and the two 

contractors sat in the main office and talked things over. Koku was eating supper, though the 

others had finished, but, naturally, it took Koku twice as long as any one else. Professor Bumper 

was busy transcribing material in his note-book.  "Well, I'm glad you've come back, Job," said his 

brother.  "Things have been going at sixes and sevens here since you went to get some new kind 

of blasting powder. By the way, I hope you got it, for we are practically at a standstill."  "Oh, I got it 

all right--some of Tom Swift's best--specially made for us. And, better still, I've brought Tom back 

with me."  "So I see. Well, I'm glad he's here."  "Now what about this accident to-day?" went on 

Job.  "Well, as I said, it's the third this week. All of them seemed to be premature blasts. But I've

human suffering and bloodshed.  Once one of Frontenac's officers, ravaging the country of the 

Oneidas, found a solitary old man in a certain village.  He was nearly a hundred years of age, but 

do not imagine his years awakened any compassion in his captors, who at once handed him over 

to their savage allies.  The old brave awaited his fate as calmly as any of those Roman senators 

whose city was taken by the Gauls.  Father Charlevoix tells us the story. He says it was a strange 

sight to behold more than four hundred savage tormentors forming a circle round a decrepit object 

from whom they could not wring a single cry, and who, as long as the breath remained in his body, 

taunted them with being the slaves of weak and foolish Frenchmen.  Only once did he complain, 

and that was when one of his butchers, on purpose to finish the scene, stabbed him repeatedly in

Irishman knocked at the door.  "Are they the fuses used in the blasts?" Walter asked.  "They are,

Only this time th' fuse didn't seem to burn more than a minute, an' I lit it meself."  "Let's see how 

long they burn now," suggested Job.  One of the your worst, so that you might behold how a man 

ought to die!"  At another time Frontenac captured two Mohawk warriors whom he condemned to 

die by torture.  One of them immediately despatched himself {141} with a knife, which a pitying 

priest threw him in prison.  But his fellow-captive, disdaining such an escape, walked boldly to the 

stake singing his death chant.  In his song he boasted that not all the power of man could extort a
