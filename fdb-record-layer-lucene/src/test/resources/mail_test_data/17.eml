their masters, they=20

were often taught to mistreat and malign each other to keep alive a feeling=

[Footnote 2: Birney, _American Churches_, p. 6.]  [Footnote 3: _Ibid_., p. =

expressed his deep regret that the whole lot of the slave was fitted to kee=

in a land of light, few=20

beams found their way to his benighted understanding. He was given no books=
 to excite his=20

curiosity. His master provided for him no teacher but the driver who broke =
