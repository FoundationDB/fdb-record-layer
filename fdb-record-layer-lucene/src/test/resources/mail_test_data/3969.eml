I was on shore by this time, trying to sun out my sodden mop of hair, which=
 I had fondly imagined I=20

could keep dry. I heard Dinkie's cry as his father captured him, and I call=
ed out to Dinky-Dunk,=20

through my combed out tresses, to have a heart.  Dinky-Dunk called back tha=
t the Indian way,=20

after all, was the only way to teach a youngster. I didn't give much though=
t to the matter until the=20

two of them were out in deeper water and I heard Dinkie's scream of stark t=
error. It came home to=20

me then that the Indian method in such things was to toss the child into de=
ep water and leave him=20

there to struggle for his life.  Dinky-Dunk, I suppose, hadn't intended to =
do quite that. But the boy=20

was naturally terrified at being carried out beyond his depth, and when I l=
ooked up I could see his=20

bony little body struggling to free itself. That timidity, I take it, anger=
ed the boy's father. And he=20

intended to cure it. He was doing his best, in fact, to fling the clutching=
 and clawing little body away=20

from him when I heard those repeated short screams of horror and promptly t=
ook a hand in the=20

matter. Something snapped in my skull, and I saw red. I hated my husband fo=
r what he was doing.=20

I hated him for the mere thought that he could do it. And I hated him for c=
alling out that this was=20

what people got by mollycoddling their children.  But that didn't stop me. =
I made for Dinky-Dunk=20

like a hundred-weight of wildcats. I went through the water like a hell-div=
er, and without quite=20

knowing what I was doing I got hold of him and tried to garrote him. I don'=
t remember what I said,=20

but I have a hazy idea it was not the most ladylike of language. He stared =
at me, as I tore Dinkie=20

away from him, stared at me with a hard and slightly incredulous eye. For I=
'm afraid I was ready to=20

fight with my teeth and nails, if need be, and I suppose my expression wasn=
't altogether angelic.=20

We were both shaking, at any rate, when we got back to dry land. Dinky-Dunk=
 stood staring at us,=20

for a silent moment or two, with a look of black disgust on his wet face. I=
'm even afraid it was=20

something more than disgust. Then he strode away and proceeded to dress on =
the other side of=20

the prairie-schooner, without so much as a second look at us. And then he w=
ent off for the horses,=20

absenting himself a quite unnecessary length of time. But I took advantage =
of that to have a talk=20

with Dinkie.  "Dinkie," I said, "you and I are going to walk out into that =
water, and this time you're=20

not going to be afraid!"  I could see his eye searching mine, although he d=
id not speak.  I put one=20

hand on the wet tangle of his hair.  "Will you come?" I asked him.  He took=
 a deep breath. Then he=20

looked at the slough-water. Then he looked back into my eyes.  "Yes," he sa=
id, though I noticed=20

his lips were not so red as usual.  So side by side and hand in hand the tw=
o of us walked out into=20

Dead-Horse Lake. His eyes questioned me, once, as the water came up about h=
is armpits. But he=20

shut his teeth tight and made no effort to draw back. I could see the invol=
untary spasms of his=20

chest as that terrifying flood closed in about his little body, yet he was =
ready enough to show me=20

he wasn't a coward. And when I saw that he had met and faced his ordeal I t=
urned him about and=20

led him quietly back to land. We were both prouder and happier for what had=
 just happened. We=20

didn't even need to talk about it, for each knew that the other understood.=
 What still disturbs me,=20

though, is something not in my boy's make-up, but in my own. During the lon=
g and silent drive=20

home I noticed a mark on my husband's neck. And I was the termagant who mus=
t have put it=20

there, though I have no memory of doing so. But from it I realize that I ha=
ven't the control over=20

myself every civilized and self-respecting woman should have. I begin to se=
e that I can't altogether=20

trust myself where my female-of-the-species affections are involved. I'm no=
 better, I'm afraid, than=20

the Bengal tigress which Dinky-Dunk once intimated I was, the Bengal tigres=
s who will battle so=20

unreasoningly for her offspring. It may be natural in mothers, whether they=
 wear fur or feathers or=20



lisle-thread stockings--but it worries me. I was an engine running wild. An=
d when you run wild you=20

are apt to run into catastrophe.     _Friday the Seventh_   Dinky-Dunk is o=
n his dignity. He has put=20

a fence around himself to keep me at a distance, the same as he puts a fenc=
e around his=20

haystacks to keep off the cattle. We are coolly polite to each other, but t=
hat is as far as it goes.=20

There is something radically wrong with this home, as a home, but I seem he=
lpless to put the=20

matter right. It's about all I have left, in this life of mine, but I'm in =
some way failing in my duty as a=20

house-wife. "Home" is a beautiful word, and home-life his own honour, for t=
he men whose ardent=20

associate he had been in the overthrow of government by prerogative and in =
the impeachment of=20

Strafford.  Flinging epithets at Cromwell is a very harmless indulgence of =
sentiment. His memory=20

has passed unscathed even through the burning eloquence which, from the pul=
pit of the=20

Restoration, denounced him as "wearing a bad hat, and that not paid for." S=
ince research has=20

placed him before us as he really was, the opinion has been gaining ground =
that he was about the=20

greatest human force ever directed to a moral purpose; and in that sense, a=
bout the greatest man,=20

take him all in all, that ever trod the scene of history. If his entire dev=
otion to his cause, his valour,=20

his magnanimity, his clemency, his fidelity to the public service, his dome=
stic excellence and=20

tenderness are not "conduct," all we can say is, so much the worse for "con=
duct." The type to=20

which his character belonged, in common with the whole series of historic t=
ypes, had in it=20

something that was special and transitory, combined with much that, so far =
as we see, was=20

universal and will endure for ever. It is in failing to note the special an=
d transitory element, and the=20

limitations which it imposed on the hero's greatness, that Carlyle's noble =
biography runs into=20

poetry, and departs from historic truth. To supply this defect is the prope=
r work of rational criticism;=20

but the criticism which begins with "Philistine" is not likely to be very r=
ational.  The objection urged=20

by Bolingbroke against Cromwell's foreign policy, on the ground that to uni=
te with France, which=20

was gaining strength, against Spain, which was beginning to decline, was no=
t the way to maintain=20

the balance of power in Europe, is once more reproduced as though it had no=
t been often brought=20

forward and answered. Cromwell was not bound to trouble his head about such=
 a figment of a=20

special diplomacy as the balance of power any more than Shakespeare was bou=
nd to trouble his=20

head about Voltaire's rules for the drama. He was the chief and the defende=
r of Protestantism, and=20

as such he was naturally led to ally himself with France, which was compara=
tively liberal, against=20

Spain, which was the great organ of the Catholic reaction. An alliance with=
 Spain was a thing=20

impossible for a Puritan. Looking to the narrower interest of England, much=
 more was to be gained=20

by a war with Spain than by a war with France, because by a war with Spain =
an entrance was=20

forced for English enterprise through the barriers which Spanish monopoly h=
ad raised against=20

commercial enterprise in America. The security of England appears, in Cromw=
ell's judgment, to=20

have depended on her intrinsic strength, which no one can doubt that, under=
 extraordinary=20

disadvantages, he immensely increased, rather than on the maintenance of a =
European=20

equilibrium which, as the number of the powers increased, became palpably i=
mpracticable. It may=20

be added, that the incipient decline of the double-headed House of Austria,=
 if it is visible to our=20

eyes as we trace back the course of events, can hardly have been visible to=
 any eye at that time,=20

and, what is still more to the purpose, that the dangerous ascendency of Lo=
uis XIV. resulted in=20

great measure from the betrayal of England by Charles II., and would have b=
een impossible had,=20

we will not say a second Cromwell, but a Protestant or patriotic monarch, s=
at on the Protector's=20



throne.  Bolingbroke suggests, and Mr. Arnold embraces the suggestion, that=
 Charles I., by=20

making war on France, showed himself more sagacious with regard to foreign =
policy than=20

Cromwell. But Mr. Arnold, in recommending Bolingbroke's philosophy to a gen=
eration which he=20

thinks has too much neglected it, has discreetly warned us to let his histo=
ry alone. Charles I., or=20

rather Buckingham, in whose hands Charles was a puppet, made war on Spain, =
though in the=20

most incapable manner, and with a most ignominious result: he at one time l=
ent the French=20

Government English ships to be used against the Protestants of Rochelle, wh=
ose resistance, apart=20

from the religious question, was the one great obstacle to the concentratio=
n of the French power;=20

and though he subsequently quarrelled with France, few will believe--assure=
dly Clarendon did not=20

believe--that among the motives for the change, policy of any kind predomin=
ated over the=20

passions and the vanity of the favourite. That Cromwell would have lent a s=
teady and effective=20

support to the Protestants, and thus have prevented the concentration of th=
e French power, is as=20

certain as any unfulfilled contingency can be.  Mr. Arnold is evidently anx=
ious to bring Bolingbroke=20

into fashion. "Hear Bolingbroke upon the success of Puritanism." Hear Lovel=
ace on Dr. Johnson;=20

one critic would be about as edifying as the other.=20


_
woman is willing to make to keep that home, and to keep ugliness out of it,=
 ought to be well=20

considered by the judge of her final destinies. I'm ready to do my part, bu=
t I don't know where to=20

begin. I'm depressed by a teasing sense of frustration, not quite tangible =
enough to fight, like=20

cobwebs across your face. It's not easy to carry around the milk of human k=
indness after they've=20

pretty well kicked the bottom out of your can!  Torrid and tiring are these=
 almost endless summer=20

days. But it's what the grain needs, and who am I to look this gift-horse o=
f heat in the face. Yet=20

there are two things, I must confess, in which the prairie is sadly lacking=
. One is trees; and the=20

other is shade, the cool green sun-filtering shade of woodlands where birds=
 can sing and mossy=20

little brooks can babble. I've been longing all day for just an hour up in =
an English cherry tree, with=20

the pectoral smell of the leaves against my face and the chance of eating a=
t least half my own=20

weight of fresh fruit. But even in the matter of its treelessness, I'm told=
, the prairie is reforming.=20

There are men living who remember when there were no trees west of Brandon,=
 except in the=20

coulees and the river-bottoms. Now that fire no longer runs wild, however, =
the trees are creeping=20

in, mile by mile and season by season. Already the eastern line of natural =
bush country reaches to=20

about ten miles from Regina two hundred miles west. Oxbow and Estevan, Dink=
y-Dunk once told=20

me, had no trees whatever when first settled, though much of that country n=
ow has a comfortable=20

array of bluffs. And forestry, of course, is giving nature a friendly push =
along, in the matter. In the=20

meantime, we have to accommodate ourselves to the conditions that prevail, =
just as the birds of=20

the air must do. Here the haughty crow of the east is compelled to nest in =
the low willows of the=20

coulee and raise its young within hand-reach of mother earth. Like our wome=
n, it can enjoy very=20

little privacy of family life. The only thing that saves us and the crows, =
I suppose, is that the men-

folks of this country are too preoccupied with their own ends to go around =
bird-nesting. They are=20

too busy to break up homes, either in willow-tops or women's hearts.... I o=
ught to be satisfied. But=20

I've been dogged, this last day or two, by a longing to be scudding in a si=
ngle-sticker off Orienta=20

Point again or to motor-cruise once more along the Sound in a smother of sp=
ray.     _Thursday the=20

Thirteenth_   Dinky-Dunk has been called to Calgary on business. It sounds =
simple enough, in=20

these Unpretentious Annals of an Unloved Worm, but I can't help feeling tha=
t it marks a trivially=20

significant divide in the trend of things. It depresses me more than I can =
explain. My depression, I=20

imagine, comes mostly from the manner in which Duncan went. He was matter-o=
f-fact enough=20

about it all, but I can't get rid of the impression that he went with a fee=
ling very much like relief. His=20

manner, at any rate, was not one to invite cross-examination, and he insist=
ed, to the end, on=20

regarding his departure as an every-day incident in the life of a preoccupi=
ed rancher. So I caught=20

my cue from him, and was as quiet about it all as he could have wished. But=
 under the crust was=20

the volcano....  The trouble with the tragedies of real life is that they a=
re never clear-cut. It takes art=20

to weave a selvage about them or fit them into a frame. But in reality they=
're as ragged and=20

nebulous as wind-clouds. The days drag on into weeks, and the weeks into mo=
nths, and life on the=20

surface seems to be running on, the same as before. There's the same superf=
icial play of all the=20

superficial old forces, but in the depths are dangers and uglinesses and su=
llen bombs of emotional=20

TNT we daren't even touch!  Heigho! I nearly forgot my _sursum-corda_ role.=
 And didn't old Doctor=20

Johnson say that peevishness was the vice of narrow minds? So here's where =
we tighten up the=20

belt a bit. But we humans, who come into the world alone, and go out of it =
alone, are always=20

hungering for companionship which we can't quite find. Our souls are island=
s, with a coral-reef of=20



reserve built up about them. Last night, when I was patching some of Gersho=
m's undies for him, I=20

wickedly worked an arrow-pierced heart, in red yarn, on one leg of his B.V.=
D.'s. This morning, I=20

noticed, his eye evaded mine and there was marked constraint in his manner.=
 I even begin to=20

detect unmistakable signs of nervousness in him when we happen to be alone =
together. And=20

during his last music lesson there was a _vibrata_ of emotion in his voice =
which made me think of=20

an April frog in a slough-end.  Even my little Dinkie, day before yesterday=
, asked me if I'd mind not=20

bathing him any more. He explained that he thought he could manage very nic=
ely by himself now.=20

It seemed trivial enough, and yet, in a way, it was momentous. I am to be d=
enied the luxury of=20

tubbing my own child. I, who always loved even the smell of that earthy and=
 soil-grubbing young=20

body, who could love it when it wasn't any too clean and could glory in its=
 musky and animal-like=20

odors as well as the satin-shine of the light on its well-soaped little rib=
s, must now stand aside=20

before the reservations of sex. It makes me feel that I've reached still an=
other divide on the=20

continent of motherhood.  This afternoon, when I wandered into the study, I=
 observed Dinkie=20

stooping over a Chesterfield pillow with his right hand upraised in a perpl=
exingly dramatic manner.=20

He turned scarlet when he saw me standing there watching him. But the quest=
ion in my eyes did=20

not escape him.  "I was pr'tendin' to be King Arthur when he found out Guin=
evere was in love with=20

Launcelot," he rather lamely explained as he walked away to the window and =
stood staring out=20

over the prairie. But for the life of me I can't understand what should hav=
e turned his thoughts into=20

that particular channel of romance. Those are matters with which the young =
and the innocent=20

should have nothing to do. They are matters, in fact, which it behooves eve=
n the old and the wary=20

to eschew.     _Sunday the Sixteenth_   It seems strange, in such golden su=
mmer weather, that=20

every man and woman and child on this sunbathed footstool of God shouldn't =
be sanely and say=20

nothing about his morals, allied himself for party purposes with the fanati=
cal clergy of the Anglican=20

Establishment, well represented by Sacheverel, and, to gratify his allies, =
passed as Minister=20

persecuting laws, about the last of the series, against Nonconformists. Thi=
s, perhaps, is a proof in=20

a certain way, of philosophic largeness of view. But if Bolingbroke is to b=
e commended to=20

ingenuous youth as a guide superior to party narrowness or bias, it may be =
well to remember the=20

passage of his letter to Sir William Wyndham, in which he very frankly desc=
ribes his own aims,=20

and those of his confederates on their accession to office, admitting that =
"the principal spring of=20

their actions was to have the government of the State in their hands, and t=
hat their principal views=20

were the conservation of this power, great employments to themselves, and g=
reat opportunities of=20

rewarding those who had helped to raise them, and of hurting those who stoo=
d in opposition to=20

them;" though he has the grace to add that with these considerations of par=
ty and private interest=20

were intermingled some which had for their object the public good. In anoth=
er place he avows that=20

he and his party designed "to fill the employments of the kingdom down to t=
he meanest with=20

Tories," by which they would have anticipated, and, indeed, by anticipation=
 outdone, the vilest and=20

most noxious proceeding of the coarsest demagogue who ever climbed to power=
 on the shoulders=20

of faction in the United States. It may be instructive to compare with this=
 the principles upon which=20

public employments were distributed by Cromwell.  It would be out of place =
to discuss the whole=20

question of the Protector's administration by way of reply to a passing thr=
ust of antipathy. But=20

when judgment is pronounced on his external policy, his critics ought not t=
o leave out of=20

consideration the Union of Scotland and Ireland with England, successfully =
accomplished by him,=20



repealed by the Restoration, and, like not a few of his other measures, rev=
ived and ratified by=20

posterity, after a delay fraught with calamitous consequences in both cases=
, and which, in the=20

case of Ireland, may perhaps even yet prove fatal.  We cannot help remarkin=
g, however, that the=20

ecclesiastical policy of the Protectorate was one which it would be most in=
consistent on the part of=20

Mr. Arnold and those who hold the same view with him to decry. It was a nat=
ional church (to=20

prevent the hasty abolition of which, seems to have been Cromwell's main re=
ason for dissolving=20

the Barebones Parliament) with the largest possible measure of comprehensio=
n. To us the weak=20

points of such a policy appear manifest enough, but by Mr. Arnold and those=
 of his way of thinking=20

it ought, if we mistake not, to be respected as an anticipation of their ow=
n deal.  Of one great and=20

irretrievable error Cromwell was guilty--he died before his hour. That his =
government was taking=20

root is clear from the bearing of Mazarin and Don Lewis De Haro, sufficient=
ly cool judges, towards=20

the Stuart Pretender. The Restoration was a reaction not against the Protec=
torate but against the=20

military anarchy which ensued. Had Cromwell lived ten years longer, or had =
his marshals been=20

true to his successor, to his cause, and to their own fortunes, there would=
 have been an end of the=20

struggle against Stuart prerogative, the spirit of Laud would have been lai=
d for ever; the temporal=20

power of ecclesiastics would have troubled no more; the Union with Scotland=
 and Ireland would=20

have remained unbroken; and the genuine representation of the people embodi=
ed in the=20

Instrument of Government would have continued to exist, in the place of rot=
ten boroughs, the=20

sources of oligarchy and corruption, of class government and class wars. Le=
t us philosophize=20

about general causes as much as we will, untoward accidents occur: the loss=
 of Pym and=20

Hampden in the early part of the Revolution, and that of Cromwell at its cl=
ose, may be fairly=20

reckoned as accidents, and they were untoward in the highest degree.  No do=
ubt, while Falkland=20

fits perfectly into the line of English progress and takes his place with o=
bvious propriety among the=20

Saints of Constitutionalism in the vestibule of the House of Commons, while=
 even Hampden finds=20

admission as the opponent of ship-money, the kind veil of oblivion being dr=
awn over the part he=20

played as a leader in the Revolution, Cromwell, though his hold over the he=
arts of the English=20

people is growing all the time, remains in an uncovenanted condition. The p=
roblem of his statue is=20

still, and, so far as England is concerned, seems likely long to be, unsolv=
ed. Put him high or low, in=20

the line of kings or out of it, he is hopelessly incongruous, incommensurab=
le, and out of place. He=20

is in fact the man of the New World; his institutions in the main embody th=
e organic principles of=20

New World society: at Washington, not at Westminster should be his statue. =
 What Puritanism did=20

for England, and what credit is due to it as an element of English characte=
r, are questions which=20

cannot be settled by mere assertion, on our side at least. In its highest d=
evelopment, and at the=20

period of its greatest men, it was militant, and everything militant is sur=
e to bear evil traces of the=20

battle. For that reason Christianity has always been in favour of peace and=
 goodwill; let the Regius=20

Professor of Theology at Oxford, in his Christian philosophy of war, be as =
ingenious and as=20

admirable as he may. But sometimes it is necessary to accept the arbitramen=
t of the sword. It was=20

necessary at Marathon, on the plain of Tours, on the waters which bore the =
Armada, at Lutzen, at=20

Marston, at Leipsic, at Gettysburg. Darius, the Moors, Philip II., Wallenst=
ein, Prince Rupert,=20

Bonaparte, the Slave-owners, did not offer you the opportunity which you wo=
uld so gladly have=20

embraced, of a tranquil and amicable discussion among lime-trees and violet=
s. On each occasion=20

the cause of human progress drew along with it plenty of mud and slime, nev=
ertheless it was the=20



cause of human progress. On each occasion the wrong side no doubt had its F=
alklands,=20

nevertheless it was the wrong side.  In the beginning of the seventeenth ce=
ntury the Reformation=20

was brought to the verge of destruction.=20


_
back in his home. And I have been realizing, the last few days, that home i=
s an empty and foolish=20

place without its man about. It's a ship without a captain, a clan without =
a chief. Yet I found it both=20

depressing and humbling to be brought once more face to face with that part=
icular fact.  Dinky-

Dunk, on the other hand, has come back with both an odd sense of elation an=
d an odd sense of=20

estrangement. He has taken on a vague something which I find it impossible =
to define. He is=20

blither and at the same time he is more solemnly abstracted. And he protest=
s that his journey was=20

a success.  "I'm going to ride two horses, from now on," he announced to me=
 this morning. "I've=20

got my chance and I'm going to grab it. I've swapped my Buckhorn lots for s=
ome inside Calgary=20

stuff and I'm lumping everything that's left of my Coast deal for a third-i=
nterest in those Barcona=20

coal-fields. There's a quarter of a million waiting there for the people wi=
th money enough to swing=20

it. And I'm going to edge in while it's still open."  "But is it possible t=
o ride two horses?" I asked,=20

waywardly depressed by all this new-found optimism.  "It's _got_ to be poss=
ible, until we find out=20

which horse is the better traveler," announced Dinky-Dunk. Then he added, w=
ithout caring to meet=20

my eye: "And I can't say I see much promise of action out of this particula=
r end of the team."  I=20

must have flamed red, at that speech, for I thought at the moment he was re=
ferring to me. It was=20

only after I'd turned the thing over in my mind, as I helped Struthers put =
together our new butter-

worker, that I saw he really referred to Casa Grande. But my husband knows =
I will never part with=20

this ranch. He will never be so foolish as to ask me to do that. Yet one th=
ing is plain. His heart is=20

no longer here. He will stick to this prairie farm of ours only for what he=
 can get out of it.  Dinkie=20

warmed the cockles of my heart by telling me this afternoon when we were ou=
t salting the horses=20

that he never wanted to go away from Casa Grande and his mummy. The child, =
I imagine, had=20

overheard some of this morning's talk. He put his arm around my knees and h=
ugged me tight. And=20

I could see the tawny look come into his hazel eyes speckled with brown. My=
 Dinkie is a prairie=20

child. His soul is not a cramped little soul, but has depth and wideness an=
d undiscerned mysteries.=20

_Sunday the Thirtieth_   Two weeks have slipped by. Two weeks have gone, an=
d left no record of=20

their going. But a prairie home is a terribly busy one, at times, and it's =
idleness that leads to the=20

ink-pot. I'm still trying to make the best of a none too promising situatio=
n, and I'll thole through, as=20

Whinstane Sandy puts it. After breakfast this morning, in fact, when Paulin=
e Augusta was swept by=20

one of those little gales of lonesomeness to which children and women are s=
o mysteriously=20

subjected, she climbed up into my lap and I rocked her on my shoulder as I =
might have rocked a=20

baby. Dinky-Dunk wandered in and inspected that performance with a slightly=
 satiric everything=20

was gone but England, Holland, Sweden, and some cantons of Switzerland. In =
England the=20

stream of reaction was running strong; Holland could not have stood by hers=
elf; Sweden was=20

nothing as a power, though it turned out that she had a man. Fortunately th=
e Lambeth Popedom=20

and the Royal Supremacy prevented the English division of the army of React=
ion from getting into=20

line with the other divisions and compelled it to accept decisive battle on=
 a separate field against=20

the most formidable soldiers of the Reformation. These soldiers saved Prote=
stantism, which was=20

their first object, and they saved English liberty into the bargain. We who=
 have come after can=20

stand by the battlefield, pouncet-box in hand, and sniff and sneer as much =
as we will.  Great Tew=20

was an anticipation, for ever beautiful and memorable, of the time when all=
 swords shall be=20

sheathed, and the world shall have entered into final peace. But in its phi=
losophy there were, as=20

the world then was, two defects; it did not reach the people, and it was in=
capable of protecting its=20



own existence. Laud himself did not care to crush it; he was an ecclesiasti=
cal despot rather than a=20

theological bigot; he had a genuine respect for learned men; he preferred w=
inning them by=20

gracious words and preferment to coercing them with the pillory and the she=
ars. But had Laud's=20

system prevailed, there would soon have been an end of the philosophy of Gr=
eat Tew. Mr. Arnold=20

points to the free thought of Bacon. Nobody in those days scented mischief =
in the inductive=20

philosophy, while in politics and religion Bacon was scrupulously orthodox.=
 Cromwell's faith was a=20

narrower and coarser thing by far than that of the inmates of the "college =
in a purer air;" but it=20

brought religion and morality--not the most genial or rational morality, bu=
t still morality--into the=20

cottage as well as into the manor-house, and it was able to protect its own=
 existence When it had=20

mounted to power in the person of its chief, the opinions of Great Tew, and=
 all opinions that would=20

abstain from trying to overthrow the Government and restore the tyranny, en=
joyed practically=20

larger and more assured liberty than they had ever enjoyed in England befor=
e or were destined to=20

enjoy for many a year to come. Falkland, says Mr. Arnold, was in the grasp =
of _fatality, hence the=20

transcendent interest that attaches to him_. Cromwell, happily for his caus=
e and for his country,=20

was, or felt himself to be, not in the grasp of fatality but in the hand of=
 God.  Might we not have=20

done just as well without Puritanism? Might not some other way have been fo=
und of preserving the=20

serious element in English character and saving English liberty from those =
who were conspiring for=20

its destruction? Such questions as these may be asked without end, and they=
 may be answered=20

by any one who is endowed with a knowledge of men who were never born, and =
of events that=20

have never happened. Might not a way have been found of rescuing the great =
interests of=20

humanity without Greek resistance=20


_
to sing:                      "Bye-bye, Baby Bunting,                     D=
addy's gone a-hunting,=20

To gather up a pile of tin                     To wrap the Baby Bunting in!=
"  Dinky-Dunk, when the=20

significance of this lilted flippancy of mine had sunk home, regarded me wi=
th a narrowed and none=20

too friendly eye.  "Feeling a bit larkier than usual this morning, aren't y=
ou?" he inquired with what=20

was merely a pretense at carelessness.  It was merely a pretense, I know, b=
ecause we'd been=20

over the old ground the night before, and the excursion hadn't added greatl=
y to the happiness of=20

either of us. Duncan, in fact, had rather horrified me by actually asking i=
f I thought there was a=20

chance of his borrowing eleven thousand dollars from Peter Ketley.  "We can=
't all trade on that=20

man's generosity!" I cried, without giving much thought to the manner in wh=
ich I was expressing=20

myself.  "Oh, _that's_ the way you feel about it!" retorted my husband. And=
 I could see his face=20

harden into Scotch granite. I could also see the look of perplexity in my s=
mall son's eyes as he=20

stood studying his father.  "Is there anything abnormal in my feeling the w=
ay I do?" I parried,=20

resenting the beetling brow of the Dour Man.  "Not if you regard him as you=
r personal and=20

particular fairy god-father," retorted my husband.  "I've no more reason fo=
r regarding him as that," I=20

said as calmly as I could, "than I have for regarding him as a professional=
 money-lender."  Duncan=20

must have seen from my face that it would be dangerous to go much further. =
So he merely=20

shrugged a flippant shoulder.  "They tell me he's got more money than he kn=
ows what to do with,"=20

he said with a heavy jocularity which couldn't quite rise.  "Then lightenin=
g his burdens is a form of=20

charity we can scarcely afford to indulge in," I none too graciously remark=
ed. And I saw my=20

husband's face harden again.  "Well, I've got to have ready money and I've =
got to have it before=20

the year's out," was his retort. He told me, when the air had cleared a lit=
tle, that he'd have to open=20

an office in Calgary as soon as harvesting was over. There was already too =
much at stake to take=20

chances. Then he asked me if there were any circumstances under which I'd b=
e willing to sell=20

Casa Grande. And I told him, quite promptly and quite definitely, that ther=
e was none.  "Then how=20

about the old Harris Ranch?" he finally inquired.  "But why should we sell =
that?" I asked. Alabama=20

Ranch, I knew, was in my name, and I had always regarded it as a sort of ne=
st-egg for the=20

children. It was something put by for a rainy day, something to fall back o=
n, if ill-luck ever overtook=20

us again.  "Because I can double and treble every dollar we get out of it, =
inside of a year," averred=20

Dinky-Dunk.  "But how am I to know that?" I contended, hating to seem hard =
and selfish and=20

narrow in the teeth of an ambitious man's enterprise.  "You'd have to take =
my word for it," retorted=20

my husband.  "But we've more than ourselves to consider," I contended, know=
ing he'd merely=20

scoff at that harping on the old string of the children.  "That's why I int=
end to get out of this rut!" he=20

cried with unexpected bitterness. And a few minutes later he made the sugge=
stion that he'd deed=20

Casa Grande entirely over to me if I'd consent to the sale of Alabama Ranch=
 and give him a=20

chance to swing the bigger plans he intended to swing.  The suggestion rath=
er took my breath=20

away. My rustic soul, I suppose, is stupidly averse to change. But I realiz=
e that when you travel in=20

double-harness you can't forever pull back on your team-mate. So I've asked=
 Dinky-Dunk to give=20

me a few days to think the thing over.     _Wednesday the Second_   Casa Gr=
ande has had an=20

invasion of visitors. It was precious old Percy and his Olga who blew in on=
 us, after being=20

swallowed up by the Big Silence for almost four long years. They came witho=
ut warning, which is=20

the free and easy way of the westerner, appearing in a mud-splattered and d=
ust-covered Ford that=20

had carried them blithely over two hundred and thirty miles of prairie trai=
ls. And with them they=20



brought a quartet of rampageous young tyranny of Bonaparte? Suppose in plac=
e of the Puritan=20

chiefs there had been raised up by miracle a set of men at once consummate =
soldiers and perfect=20

philosophers, who would have fought and won the battle without being heated=
 by the conflict.=20

Suppose, to prevent the necessity of any conflict at all, Charles, Straffor=
d, and Laud had=20

voluntarily abandoned their designs. As it was, Puritanism did, and alone c=
ould do, the work. What=20

the Renaissance would have been without Puritan morality we can pretty well=
 guess from the=20

experience of Italy. It would have probably been like the life of Lorenzo--=
vice, filthy vice, decorated=20

with art and with elegant philosophy; an academy under the same roof with a=
 brothel. There were=20

ages before morality, and there have been ages between the moralities. Ther=
e was, in England,=20

an age between the decline of the Catholic morality and the rise of the Pur=
itan, marked by a laxity=20

of conduct, public and private, which was partly redeemed but not neutraliz=
ed by Elizabethan=20

genius and enterprise. No doubt when the revival came, there was a High Chu=
rch as well as a=20

Puritan morality, and that fact ought always to be borne in mind; but the H=
igh Church morality was=20

inextricably bound up with sacerdotal superstition and with absolute govern=
ment; it had no hold on=20

the people; and it found itself suspiciously at home in the Court of James,=
 in the households of=20

Somerset and Buckingham, and in the tribunal which lent itself to the divor=
ce of Essex.  That the=20

Puritan Revolution was followed by a sacerdotal and sensualist reaction is =
too true: all revolutions=20

are followed by reactions; it is one great reason for avoiding them. But le=
t it be remembered, first,=20

that the disbanded soldiers of the Commonwealth and the other relics of the=
 Puritan party still=20

remained the most moral and respectable element in the country; and secondl=
y, that the period of=20

lassitude which follows great efforts, whether of men or nations, is not al=
together the=20

condemnation of the effort, but partly the weakness of humanity. Nations as=
 well as men, if they=20

aim high, must sometimes overstrain themselves, and weariness must ensue. N=
or did the=20

Commonwealth of England come to nothing, though in a society not half emanc=
ipated from=20

feudalism it was premature, and therefore, at the time, a failure. It opene=
d a glimpse of a new=20

order of things: it was the first example of a great national republic, the=
 republics of antiquity=20

having been at once city republics and republics of slave-owners: it not on=
ly heralded but, to some=20

extent, prepared the American and even the French Revolution. In its sublim=
e death-song,=20

chanted by the great Puritan poet, our ears catch the accents of a hope tha=
t did not die.  The=20

Restoration was the end of the Puritan party, which thenceforth separated i=
nto two portions, the=20

high political element taking the form of Whiggism, while the more religiou=
s element was=20

represented in subsequent history by the Nonconformists. Under the Marian r=
eaction=20

Protestantism had been saved, and the errors which it had committed in its =
hour of ascendency=20

had been redeemed by the champions, drawn mostly from the humbler classes, =
who suffered for it=20

at the stake. Under the Restoration it was again saved, and the errors whic=
h it had once more=20

committed in the hour of political triumph were once more redeemed by marty=
rs of the same class,=20

whose sufferings in the noisome and pestilential prisons of that day were p=
robably not much less=20

severe than the pangs of those who died by fire. Both in the Marian and in =
the Restoration martyrs=20

of Protestantism there was no doubt much that was irrational and unattracti=
ve; yet the record of=20

their services to humanity remains, and will remain; let the free-thought o=
f modern times, for which=20

their self-devoting loyalty to such truth as they knew made way, be gratefu=
l or ungrateful to them=20

as it will.  The relations of Nonconformity, with which we must couple Scot=
ch Presbyterianism, its=20



partner in fundamental doctrine, its constant ally in the conflict, and fel=
low-sufferer in the hour of=20

adversity, to English religion, morality,=20


_
turned our sedate homestead into a rodeo.  Percy himself is browner and sto=
uter and more=20

rubicund than I might have expected, with just a sprinkling of gray under h=
is lopsided Stetson to=20

announce that Time hasn't been standing still for any of us. But one would =
never have taken him=20

for an ex-lunger. And there is a wholesomeness about the man, for all his q=
uietness, which draws=20

one to him. Olga herself still again impressed me as a Zorn etching come to=
 life, as a Norse myth=20

in petticoats, with the same old largeness of limb and the same old suggest=
ion of sky-line=20

vastnesses about her. She still looks as though the Lord had made her when =
the world was young=20

and the women of Homer did their spinning in the sunlight. Some earlier tou=
ch of morning=20

freshness is gone from her, it's true, for you can't move about with four l=
ittle toddlers in your wake=20

and still suggest the budding vine. But that morning freshness has been sup=
planted by a full and=20

mellow noonday contentedness which is not without its placid appeal. To her=
 husband, at any rate,=20

she seems mysteriously and to the English civilization in general, would be=
 a most important and=20

instructive chapter in English history, but we are hardly called upon to at=
tempt to write it in=20

refutation of jocose charges of "hideousness" and "immense ennui." A suffic=
ient answer to such=20

quips and cranks will be found, we believe, within the same covers with Mr.=
 Arnold's "Falkland," in=20

the shape of an article on the Pulpit, by Mr. Baldwin Brown, which in tone =
and culture appears to=20

us a fit companion for any other paper in the journal.  That Nonconformity =
has been political is=20

true. Fortunately for the liberties of England it has had to struggle for c=
ivil right in order to obtain=20

religious freedom. No doubt in the course of the conflict it has contracted=
 a certain gloominess of=20

character, and shown an unamiable side. Treat men with persistent and insol=
ent injustice, strip=20

them of their rights as citizens, put on them a social brand, compel them t=
o pay for the=20

maintenance of the pulpits from which their religion is assailed, and you w=
ill run a very great risk of=20

souring their tempers.=20
