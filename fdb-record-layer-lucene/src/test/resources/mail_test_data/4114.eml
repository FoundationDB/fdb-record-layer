"That's right," Stew agreed soberly. "Even those three torpedo planes have =
gone to join the attack=20

on the carrier. We're in the sky alone." A strange wave of loneliness swept=
 over him. "It may be=20

months before we know how that battle ended." Jack nodded in the direction =
from which came a=20

continuous roar of motors, machine-gun fire, bursting shells, and exploding=
 bombs. "We're on our=20

own, and I don't mean maybe!"                                    CHAPTER VI=
                              PLANE=20

WRECKED   The plane rattled, sputtered, and roared. Stew threw back the hoo=
d, climbed out to=20

the wings to see what, if anything, might be done to keep her aloft. Then h=
e threw back his seat to=20

drop flat on his stomach and poke around in the fuselage. His hand touched =
Jack's violin. He=20

shoved this forward within easy reach.  "Jack can play for the birds, the l=
izards, and the land crabs=20

on our island," he said to himself with a grim laugh.  There was not much h=
e could do. The main=20

trouble was with the motor. It had taken a slug or two, and was beginning t=
o smoke.  Alternately=20

they gained and lost altitude. Each time they lost more than they had gaine=
d.  "There's a Zero!"=20

Stew exclaimed, righting his seat and gripping his gun.  The Zero kept poki=
ng its nose in and out=20

of the rain squall that was moving slowly toward them.  "Scouting for their=
 lost cargo ships," said=20

Jack.  The three destroyers, now robbed of their charges, were beginning to=
 slip from sight. "Going=20

to that other fight," Jack thought. He and Stew were leaving the fight behi=
nd, and under the=20

circumstances he was not sorry. It seemed less violent now. Had their comra=
des won or lost? Had=20

the Jap carrier been put out of action? He did not know the answer.  His mo=
tor coughed hoarsely,=20

then was silent. They lost altitude rapidly.  "Get ready to bail out!" he s=
napped.  The motor=20

coughed, rumbled, then by Dr. Charles T. Porter, of Albany, in the _Journal=
 of Psychological=20

Medicine_, April, 1870. Mrs. Fero was murdered while in her bed and was fou=
nd to have been=20

bruised about the head and body, her husband claiming that the deed was tha=
t of a robber who=20

had attacked them both. He was found with slight bruises or scratches about=
 the face and black=20

marks as if from burnt powder between the middle fingers of his right hand.=
 The first autopsy=20

appears to have been carelessly made, but a flattened conical ball weighing=
 twenty-six and one-

half grains was found lodged in the middle of the right cerebral hemisphere=
. It had not gone=20

completely through the brain. Its base fitted the shells of the metallic ca=
rtridges used in Fero=E2=80=99s=20

revolver. Eight days after death a second examination was made, after which=
 the head was=20

removed and preserved in 95% alcohol. A theory of the prosecution was that =
Mrs. Fero was=20

murdered by her husband; that he shot her, as well as struck her numerous b=
lows upon both sides=20

of the head and its front and back with some broad, heavy, and elastic body=
, making fractures=20

found on autopsy. Not the least interesting part of the testimony is that r=
eferring to the condition of=20

tissues alleged to have been bruised after long preservation in alcohol. Th=
e expert testimony in=20

this case appeared to show that such fractures as were found, without refer=
ence to the fact of=20

external bruises, were due to the unskilful manner in which the skull-cap w=
as removed. In this=20

connection it is well right here to emphasize the fact that fresh fractures=
 can be produced in the=20

skull by too forcible or injudicious efforts to remove the calvarium when m=
aking autopsies, or that=20

fractures previously existing can be extended or complicated in the same wa=
y. Shaw in his=20

=E2=80=9CManual of Anatomy=E2=80=9D says: =E2=80=9CThe question whether the=
re has been a fracture of the cranium=20

previous to death=20

They climbed once more, then slowly sank.  The islands were much closer now=
. "We'd better head=20

for the middle one," Jack said. "It's the largest. Got quite a peak in the =
middle of it."  "Must be=20

several hundred feet high," Stew said. "There's sure to be good, fresh wate=
r there. Natives too.=20

There's an island around here somewhere, they say, where the natives eat sh=
ipwrecked=20

Chinamen, or used to."  "Well, we're not Chinamen!" Jack's laugh was a bit =
doubtful.  "Could be=20

they're not choosy." Stew's laugh was doubtful too.  "Have to take a chance=
, that's all war is after=20

all--just one risk after another. We--"  The motor went dead again. One mor=
e struggle, one more=20

victory.  Twice more this was repeated. The last time they were not much mo=
re than ten miles=20

from the islands.  "That's all she'll do," Jack decided. "Get ready to tumb=
le out if we land too hard.=20

We're going down."  Gripping the half-inflated lifeboat, Stew shoved back t=
he hood, and stood=20

there, with the wind in his eyes, as they circled downward.  The time was s=
urprisingly short. They=20

hit the water hard, bounced, struck again--then with a final splash, the pl=
ane almost nosed over=20

into the sea.  Stew had the life raft ready in a twinkling--none too soon a=
t that, for their left wing=20

was all but torn away.  Stew was on the life raft, with paddle in hand. Jac=
k was prepared to drop=20

down onto the raft when he stopped suddenly.  "Wait a second," he said, cli=
mbing into the plane=20

again.  He came back after a while with the violin. "After what Ted did for=
 us today," he confided, "I=20

couldn't leave it." And they paddled away toward the middle island.  "That =
Ted must be a real guy,"=20

was Stew's comment.  "You don't know the half of it. I'll tell you about it=
 some time." Jack settled=20

back against the circular side of the raft. "Boy! Am I tired!"  difficult t=
o decide than a person not=20

accustomed to make dissections might imagine. If the fracture has occurred =
immediately before=20

the patient=E2=80=99s death, there will be found coagulated blood upon the =
bones and in the fissures. If the=20

patient has survived for some time, there will be marks of inflammation and=
, perhaps, pus in=20

contact with the skull, but if a fracture has been made in making the exami=
nation, which=20

sometimes happens in even very careful dissectors=E2=80=99 hands, the blood=
 in the fracture will not be=20

coagulated, nor will there be any effusions around the portions. In Beck=E2=
=80=99s _Medical Journal_, Vol.=20

XXII., p. 28, Mr. Alcock some time since stated in a public lecture in Lond=
on that he had known a=20

fracture of the base of the skull produced by the awkward and violent teari=
ng of the upper portion=20

by the saw in penetrating enough to divide the bones, and this to be mistak=
en by the=20

inexperienced operator for fracture of the skull producing death. Being a m=
edico-legal case, it=20

might have led to melancholy consequences had not the error been detected b=
y an observer.=E2=80=9D=20

That an extensive and often complicated fracture by _contre coup_ can occur=
 as the result of=20

gunshot injuries of the skull is a fact well known to all surgeons of exper=
ience and laid down in all=20

text-books and illustrated in all large museums.  In view of these well-kno=
wn facts, it would always=20

be well to insist in cases of this kind that the saw alone should be used a=
nd not the hammer nor=20

the chisel. When a cranial bone is fractured blood is poured out from the r=
uptured vessels, as is=20

always the case with any bone. Its amount varies indefinitely with the numb=
er and size of the=20

ruptured vessels, the activity of circulation, the length of time a person =
lives, etc. The blood may=20

collect in circumscribed masses or become infiltrated in=20


_
"Take it easy," Stew advised.  "We'll have to paddle ten miles at least. A =
Jap plane may spot us on=20

the way."  "We don't really need to paddle at all," Stew said. "There's a s=
trong current running=20

toward the islands."  "How do you know?" Jack sat up.  "While you went back=
 for the violin I threw=20

a stick into the water. It started right for the island."  "That," said Jac=
k, "was my whittling stick."=20

"Too bad!" Stew said. "But then, there must be a million sticks on our isla=
nd. Seems to be covered=20

with trees."  The current was not all that Stew had hoped for. It carried t=
hem along at no more than=20

two miles an hour. And the distance was far greater than they had imagined.=
 For several hours=20

they were obliged to paddle beneath hot, tropical skies. Finally, when the =
sun had gone to rest and=20

the moon had taken up its watch, they found themselves listening to the eas=
y wash of the surf=20

against the mysterious shore.  As phenomena are observed. The extent to whi=
ch infiltration takes=20

place depends upon the quantity of blood and the nature of the surrounding =
tissues. In loose=20

tissues like those about the orbit infiltration is much more rapid and exte=
nsive.  =3DExamination of=20

 may determine the time=20

elapsed between the death of a person and the discharge of a weapon found n=

exact statements in this matter are utterly out of the question. Certain fa=
