manuscripts and the Church felt secure. Christianity has undeniably had her=
 great Seers and=20

Prophets, like every other religion; but their claims are not strengthened =
by denying their=20

predecessors.  Listen to Plato:       Know then, Glaucus, that when I speak=
 of the production of=20

good,     it is the Sun I mean. The Son has a perfect analogy with his     =
Father.   Iamblichus calls=20

the Sun "the image of divine intelligence or Wisdom." Eusebius, repeating t=
he words of Philo, calls=20

the rising Sun ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER=
=20

NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL=20

LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA=20

WITH VARIA~}) the chief Angel, the most ancient, adding that the Archangel =
who is=20

_polyonymous_ (of many names) is the Verbum or Christ. The word Sol (Sun) b=
eing derived from=20

_solus_, the One, or the "He alone," and its Greek name Helios meaning the =
"Most High," the=20

emblem becomes comprehensible. Nevertheless, the Ancients made a difference=
 between the=20

Sun and its prototype.  Socrates saluted the rising Sun as does a true Pars=
i or Zoroastrian in our=20

own day; and Homer and Euripides, as Plato did after them several times, me=
ntion the Jupiter-

Logos, the "Word" or the Sun. Nevertheless, the Christians maintain that si=
nce the oracle=20

consulted on the God Iao answered: "It is the Sun," therefore       The Jeh=
ovah of the Jews was=20

well known to the Pagans and     Greeks;(515)   and "Iao is our Jehovah." T=
he first part of the=20

proposition has nothing, it seems, to do with the second part, and least of=
 all can the conclusion be=20

regarded as correct. But if the Christians are so anxious to prove the iden=
tity, Occultists have=20

nothing against it. Only, in such case, Jehovah is also Bacchus. It is very=
 strange that the people=20

of civilised Christendom should until now hold on so desperately to the ski=
rts of the idolatrous=20

Jews--Sabaeans and Sun worshippers as they were,(516) like the rabble of Ch=
aldaea--and that=20

they should fail to see that the later Jehovah is but a Jewish development =
of the Ja-va, or the Iao,=20

of the Phoenicians; that this name, in short, was the secret name of a Myst=
ery-God, one of the=20

many Kabiri. "Highest God" as He was for one little nation, he never was so=
 regarded by the=20

Initiates who conducted the Mysteries; for them he was but a Planetary Spir=
it attached to the=20

visible Sun; and the visible Sun is only the central Star, not the central =
spiritual Sun.       with=20

flaxen hair, blue eyes,--at once saucy and languishing."  "But what say you=
 to Raoul's fancy?"=20

"Nothing--I laugh at Raoul; but this first desire of the heart is imperious=
. I remember, just at his=20

age, how deep in love I was with a Grecian statue which our good king, then=
 Henry IV., gave my=20

father, insomuch that I was mad with grief when they told me that the story=
 of Pygmalion was=20

nothing but a fable."  "It is mere want of occupation. You do not make Raou=
l work, so he takes his=20

own way of employing himself."  "Exactly; therefore I think of sending him =
away from here."  "You=20

will be wise to do so."  "No doubt of it; but it will break his heart. So l=
ong as three or four years ago=20

he used to adorn and adore his little idol, whom he will some day fall in l=
ove with in right earnest if=20

he remains here. The parents of little La Valliere have for a long time per=
ceived and been amused=20

at it; now they begin to look concerned."  "Nonsense! However, Raoul must b=
e diverted from this=20

fancy. Send him away or you will never make a man of him."  "I think I shal=
l send him to Paris."=20

"So!" thought D'Artagnan, and it seemed to him that the moment for attack h=
ad arrived.=20

"Suppose," he said, "we roughly chalk out a career for this young man. I wi=
sh to consult you about=20

some thing."  "Do so."  "Do you think it is time for us to enter the servic=
e?"  "But are you not still in=20

the service--you, D'Artagnan?"  "I mean active service. Our former life, ha=
s it still no attractions for=20



you? would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of Port=
hos, the exploits of=20

our youth?"  "Do you propose to me to do so, D'Artagnan?"  "Decidedly and h=
onestly."  "On whose=20

side?" asked Athos, fixing his clear, benevolent glance on the countenance =
of the Gascon.  "Ah,=20

devil take it, you speak in earnest----"  "And must have a definite answer.=
 Listen, D'Artagnan.=20

There is but one person, or rather, one cause, to whom a man like me can be=
 useful--that of the=20

king."  "Exactly," answered the musketeer.  "Yes, but let us understand eac=
h other," returned=20

Athos, seriously. "If by the cause of the king you mean that of Monsieur de=
 Mazarin, we do not=20

understand each other."  "I don't say exactly," answered the Gascon, confus=
ed.  "Come,=20

D'Artagnan, don't let us play a sidelong game; your hesitation, your evasio=
n, tells me at once on=20

whose side you are; for that party no one dares openly to recruit, and when=
 people recruit for it, it=20

is with averted eyes and humble voice."  "Ah! my dear=20


_
thus after my name, seeing it is secret."(517)   However this may be, the i=
dentity of the Jehovah of=20

Mount Sinai with the God Bacchus is hardly disputable, and he is surely--as=
 already shown in _Isis=20

Unveiled_--Dionysos.(518) Wherever Bacchus was worshipped there was a tradi=
tion of=20

Nyssa,(519) and a cave where he was reared. Outside Greece, Bacchus was the=
 all-powerful=20

"Zagreus, the highest of Gods," in whose service was Orpheus, the founder o=
f the Mysteries. Now,=20

unless it be conceded that Moses was an initiated Priest, an Adept, whose a=
ctions are all narrated=20

allegorically, then it must be admitted that he personally,  "You know that=
 I am not alluding to you;=20

you are the pearl of brave, bold men. I speak of that spiteful and intrigui=
ng Italian--of the pedant=20

who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pi=
llow--of the scoundrel=20

who calls his party the party of the king--who wants to send the princes of=
 the blood to prison, not=20

daring to kill them, as our great cardinal--our cardinal did--of the miser,=
 who weighs his gold pieces=20

and keeps the clipped ones for fear, though he is rich, of losing them at p=
lay next morning--of the=20

impudent fellow who insults the queen, as they say--so much the worse for h=
er--and who is=20
