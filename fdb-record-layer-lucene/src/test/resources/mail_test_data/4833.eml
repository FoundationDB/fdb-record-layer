And with that she threw her apron over her head and began to sob--a sound w=

cheerfully. "But the boys, or the men, either, couldn't find us in this sto=
rm. We will have to be=20

patient."  Patience was hard indeed to cultivate in their present situation=
. The minutes dragged by=20

with funereal slowness. Lluella began to sob, and the most cheerful of the =
party could not keep up=20

her spirits indefinitely.  "Oh, but we'll be all right, I am sure!" quoth M=
adge. "Don't get down-

hearted, girls."  Helen broke down next and declared that she could not rem=
ain idle any longer.=20

"We must move out of this," she said. "We must find our way back. Why, they=
 might come this way=20

hunting for us and never find us--go right by the tree. We ought to get out=
side and shout, at least."=20

"Don't let's leave this warm shelter," begged Ruth. "It will be really seri=
ous if we move farther from=20

the regular camp instead of toward it."  "But we cannot hear any rescue par=
ty shouting for us, nor=20

can they hear us under this drift," insisted Helen.  "Then we'll go out, on=
e at a time, and shout,"=20

declared Ruth. "Let me try."  She sprang up and pushed her way through the =
drift at the mouth of=20

their burrow. Not until she was standing outside did she realize the extent=
 of the storm. The snow=20

was swept across the country in a thick and heavy curtain, with a wind driv=
ing it, against which she=20

knew she could not stand.  She could not shout into the teeth of the gale, =
and her cry was driven=20

back into her own ears as weak as the mew of a kitten.  "Ho!" exclaimed Mad=
ge Steele. "They=20

couldn't hear that if they were a stone's throw off. Let _me_ give a warwho=
op."  "We're all coming=20

out!" cried the dissatisfied Lluella. "Let's all shout. Oh, girls! we've _g=
ot_ to get back to the camp.=20

We'll die here."  They scrambled out of the burrow. The wind smote full aga=
inst them when once=20

they were in the open. When they raised their voices in chorus it seemed as=
 though there was an=20

answering shout from a certain direction.  "Here we are! here we are! Fathe=
r! Tom!" shrieked=20

Helen, at the top of her voice.  "Don't go!" begged Ruth. "Let us stick by =
the tree. It will shelter us.=20

Shout again."  But the majority of the girls were for setting off at once t=
oward the sound they=20

thought they had heard in the midst of the storm. Again and again they shou=
ted. They clung to=20

each other's hands as they ploughed through the drifts (the snowshoes were =
of no use to them=20

now) but they did not hear the answering cry again.  At last they stopped, =
all sorely frightened,=20

Lluella in tears. "What will we do now?" gasped Belle.  "We'd better go bac=
k to that tree. We were=20

safe there," muttered Heavy, her teeth chattering.  But they had drifted wi=
th the storm, and when=20

they turned to face it was at the end of her own. She would have liked, she=
 thought, to strike him=20

as he stood before her deprecating, yet every moment recovering himself.  "=
If another man=20

chooses to take it upon him, why should I contradict him?" Rintoul said, wi=
th good sense=20

unanswerable. "I was stunned with astonishment; but when you reflect, how c=
ould I contradict=20

him? If he did it for John Erskine's sake, it would have spoiled the arrang=
ement."  "John Erskine=20

would never make any arrangement. If he had been to blame he would have bor=
ne it. He would=20

not have shirked or drawn back!"  "You think better of John Erskine than of=
 me, Nora. I do not=20

know what it is, but I have no right to interfere. I'll give the old fellow=
 something when it's all over. It=20

is not for me he is doing it, whatever is his reason. I should spoil it all=
 if I said a word. Will you=20

forgive me now?" said Rintoul, with a mixture of calm reason and anxiety. H=
e had quite recovered=20

himself. And Nora, still in a flutter of slowly dissipating excitement, cou=
ld find no argument against=20

that sturdy good sense of his. For he was strong in sense, however worldly =
it might be.  "I cannot=20

understand it at all. Do you know who the man was?" she said.  And then he =
laughed--actually=20

laughed--though he was on the borders of desperation an hour ago. The echo =
of it seemed to run=20

round the garden among the listening trees and horrified Nora. But at his n=
ext word she threw up=20



her hands in consternation, with a cry of bewilderment, confusion, almost a=
musement too, though=20

she would have thought that impossible,--"Old Rolls!"     CHAPTER XLIV.   J=
ohn Erskine returned=20

to Dalrulzian alone after this wonderful morning's work. He could scarcely =
believe that he was free=20

to walk where he pleased,--to do what he liked. Four days is not a long per=
iod of time. But prison=20

has an extraordinary effect, and his very limbs had seemed to tingle when h=
e got the uncontrolled=20

use of them again. Lord Lindores had driven him back as far as the gates of=
 Lindores, and from=20

thence he walked on, glad of the air, the sense of freedom and movement,--t=
he silence in which to=20

realise all that had passed. Enough had passed, indeed, to give full occasi=
on for thought; and it=20

was only now that the extraordinary character of the event struck him. Roll=
s! to associate Rolls=20

with a tragedy. In his excitement John burst into a wild fit of laughter, w=
hich echoed along the quiet=20

road; then, horrified by the sound, drew himself quickly together, and went=
 on with the gravest=20

countenance in the world. But it must be added that this thought of Rolls w=
as only momentary,--it=20

came and went, and was dropped into the surrounding darkness, in which=20


_
snow.  "Oh, oh, oh!" wailed Helen. "We're lost! we're lost!"  "Hold up! Be =
brave!" urged her chum.=20

"We must not give up now. Some other tree will give us shelter. Cling toget=
her, girls. We _must_=20

get somewhere."  But where? It was a question none of them could answer. Th=
ey remained=20

cowering in the driving snow, utterly confused as to direction, and fast be=
coming buried where=20

they stood.     CHAPTER XXI  ADRIFT IN THE STORM   "We shall freeze to deat=
h together as=20

insignificant and secondary, in comparison with one central consciousness w=
ith which his whole=20

firmament was ablaze. He had demanded "More! more!" but had not received an=
other word. No=20

explanation had ensued. The mother had come in with soft authority, with a =
steadfast blank of all=20

understanding. Lady Lindores would not see that they wanted to talk to each=
 other. She had not=20

ceased to hold her daughter by the arm, affectionately leaning=20


_
Madge Steele spoke thus, and the situation precluded any doubt as to the tr=
uth of the statement.=20

The six girls from Snow Camp were indeed in peril of death--and all were co=
nvinced of the fact.=20

Lluella Fairfax was in tears, and her chum, Belle Tingley, was on the verge=
 of weeping, too. Helen=20

Cameron had hard work to keep back her own sobs; even Jennie Stone, the sto=
ut girl, was past=20

turning the matter into a joke. And Madge Steele was unable to suggest a si=
ngle cheerful portent.=20

As they clung to each other in the driving snow they seemed, intuitively, t=
o turn to Ruth Fielding.=20

She was the youngest of the six girls; but she was at this moment the more =
assertive and held=20

herself better under control than her mates.  It had been against her advic=
e that they had left their=20

temporary shelter under the tree. Now they could not beat their way back to=
 it. Indeed, none of=20

them now knew the direction of the burrow that had sheltered them for more =
than an hour.  What=20

next should they do?  Although unspoken, this was the question that the fiv=
e silently asked of the=20

girl of the Red Mill. She had displayed her pluck and good sense on more th=
an one occasion, and=20

her friends looked to her for help. Particularly did Helen cling to her in =
this emergency, and=20

although Ruth was secretly as terrified as any of her mates, she could not =
give in to the feeling=20

when her chum so depended upon her.  "Why, we're acting just as silly as we=
 can act!" she cried,=20

speaking loud so that they could had not spoken another word--had not even =
met his anxious=20

looks with more than the most momentary fugitive glance. Thus John had with=
drawn in that state=20

of half certainty which, perhaps, is more absorbing to the faculties and mo=
re transporting to the=20

heart than any definite and indisputable fact ever can be. His whole being =
was in movement,=20

agitated by a delicious doubt, by an eager breathless longing to know, whic=
h was sweeter than=20

knowledge. All the romance and witchcraft of passion was in it, its most et=
hereal part      "Hopes,=20

and fears that kindle hopes--       An indistinguishable throng;     And ge=
ntle wishes long subdued,=20

Subdued and cherished long."  Such was the potency of this charm, that, aft=
er he had thrown one=20

thought at Rolls, and perceived the absurdity of the event, and given vent =
to the excited=20

commentary of that laugh, John abandoned himself altogether to the sea of f=
ancies, the questions,=20

the answers, the profound trains of reasoning which belonged to that other =
unresolved and all-

entrancing problem. He discussed with himself every word of Edith's letter,=
 turning it over and=20

over. Did it mean this? or peradventure, after all, did it only mean _that_=
? But if it meant that and=20

not this, would she have so replied to his looks? would not she have said s=
omething more=20

definitely discouraging when he appealed to her for More! more? She had not=
 given him a word=20

more; but she had replied with no stony look, no air of angry surprise or d=
isdain, such=20


_
boys, or Mr. Cameron, will find us. It can't keep on snowing forever."  "Bu=
t we're freezing to death!"=20

said Belle, and broke out sobbing like her chum.  "Stop, you silly thing!" =
cried Madge, trying to=20

shake her. But she was really so cold herself that she could not do this. I=
ndeed, the keen wind=20

would soon make movement impossible if they stood still for long.  "Let's k=
eep moving!" shouted=20

Ruth. "Take hold of hands, girls--two by two. Helen and I will go ahead. No=
w, Belle, you take=20

Lluella. Madge and Heavy in the rear. Forward--march!"  "This is a regular =
Amazon March; isn't=20

it?" croaked Heavy, from behind.  "But where shall we march to?" Belle quer=
ied.  "We'll keep going=20

until we find some shelter. That's the best we can do. Indeed, it is all we=
 _can_ do," replied Ruth.=20

It was impossible to do more than drift before the gale. Ruth knew this, an=
d likewise she was=20

confident that they were by no means getting nearer to the camp when they f=
ollowed such a=20

course. But she hoped to find some shelter before the weakest of the girls =
gave out.  This was=20

Lluella Fairfax. She was delicately built, and unused to muscular exertion =
of any kind. She seldom=20

took up any gym on the other hand, might it not be possible that compassion=
 and sympathy for his=20

extraordinary circumstances, and the wrong he had undergone, might keep her=
, so sweet and=20

good as she was, from any discouraging word? Only, in that case, would she =
have cast down her=20

eyes _like that_? would they have melted into that unspeakable sweetness? S=
o he ran on, as so=20

many have done before him. He thought no more of the matter which had affec=
ted him so deeply=20

for the last week, or of Torrance, who was dead, or of Rolls, who was in ja=
il, than he did of last=20

year's snow. Every interest in heaven and earth concentrated to him in thes=
e endless delightful=20

questions. When a man, or, for that matter, a woman, is in this beatific ag=
itation of mind, the=20

landscape generally becomes a sort of blurr of light around them, and, save=
 to the inward eye,=20

which more than ever at such a moment is "the bliss of solitude," there is =
nothing that is very=20

clearly visible. John saw this much, but no more, in Miss Barbara's old-fas=
hioned dining-room--the=20

genial gentlemen still at table, and Miss Barbara herself, in her white sha=
wl, forming only a=20

background to the real interest; and he perceived=20


_
Briarwood, Ruth knew; therefore it was not strange that she should be the f=
irst to give out.  For,=20

although the sextette of girls went but a short distance, and traveled very=
 slowly, it was indeed a=20

fearful task for them. The storm drove them on, and suddenly, when Jennie S=
tone gave utterance=20

to a wild whoop and disappeared from view, Lluella and Belle burst out cryi=
ng again, and even=20

Madge showed signs of weakening.  "Help! help!" she cried. "She's fallen do=
wn a precipice!"=20

"She's smothered in a snow-bank!" gasped Helen.  Heavy uttered another cry,=
 but seemingly from=20

a great way off. Ruth round him as he walked, or the glow of the autumn fol=
iage, the distance=20

rolling away in soft blueness of autumnal mists to Tinto. He managed to wal=
k along the road=20

without seeing it, though it was so familiar, and arrived at his own gate w=
ith great surprise, unable=20

to comprehend how he could have come so far. When he opened the gate, Peggy=
 Fleming came=20

out with her apron folded over her hands; but when she saw who it was, Pegg=
y, forgetting the=20

soap-suds, which showed it was washing day, flung up her red moist arms to =
the sky, and gave=20

utterance to a wild "skreigh" of welcome and joy. For a=20
