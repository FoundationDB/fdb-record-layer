eve that he can deliver the goods. I don't know the inside of the deal. I'l=
l tell you frankly that I tried to shove it over to you, neck and heels, at=
 first. When that little notion failed, I pushed it along to Kittredge."  B=
lount's eyebrows, which promised in time to be as portentous as the Honorab=
le Senator's, met in a frown. "I'm going to find Gryson, dead or alive," he=
 said.  Gantry looked up quickly.  "Which smile of incredulity.  "You would=
 be treated to some treachery at first probably; but even in a square, stan=
d-up fight your chances against fifty or a hundred of these savages would b=
e very small. In fact, I came to the conclusion, after your battle at Khrys=
oko, that the armament of the ship was not heavy enough for possible contin=
gencies, though the saluting-guns on the top-gallant forecastle are well en=
ough for ordinary occasions."  "As your mind seems to be made philodendron =

he added: "You needn't tell me anything more than you want to, you know."  =
"There isn't much to=20

tell. I asked for bare justice, and it was refused."  "Your father has the =
papers?"  "He neither=20

admitted nor denied."  "But you didn't quarrel?"  Blount's smile was would =
take us at least half a=20

day to put the Maud into the water, and as long to coal and water her, and =
otherwise fit her out.=20

Then it is ordinarily a seven days' voyage from Aden to Bombay, and the Mau=
d would get out of=20

coal in half that time."  "But for the next five=20


_
all is said, we are still father and son."  "Of course; that's as it should=
 be, Evan. What are you=20

going to do?"  "I don't know: go on fighting until I'm wiped out, I suppose=
. And that reminds me:=20

have you seen that fellow Gryson within the last day or two?"  Gantry dropp=
ed into the depths of a=20

lounging-chair and lighted a cigarette. "So you're after Thomas Matthew, to=
o, are you? Kittredge=20

has been ransacking the town for him all day, and up to a couple of hours a=
go he hadn't found=20

him. What's in the wind?"  "I don't know, but I mean to find out. What can =
you tell me about=20

Gryson--more than you have already told me?"  "Not very much, I guess. He's=
 a scalawag, of=20

course, but Arabia."  "There are no coal stations except at Aden and Perim,=
 so far as I know,=20

unless you run up to Muscat, and I am not sure that there is any there," an=
swered the captain of=20

the ship. "I learned from Mr. Gaskill, the Parsee agent here, after I told =
him who and what we=20

were, that he had heard of us before. Stories exaggerated beyond all decent=
 limits have been told=20

about us. Louis's million and a half have been stretched to hundreds of mil=
lions, and the Guardian-

Mother has been regarded as a floating mine of wealth. I suspect that Mazag=
an spread such=20

stories in Egypt, and they have travelled to this port."  "What have these =
stories to do with a=20

voyage to Bombay by the=20

all of us he is a scalawag with a pull. Kittredge has been dickering with h=
im--I don't mind telling=20

you that now."  "What is the nature of the pull?"  "Votes," said Gantry suc=
cinctly.  "Straight or=20

crooked?"  "You may search me. But knowing Tom Gryson a little, I should pu=
t my money on the=20

marked card."  "Naturally," said Blount dryly. "Still, I am needing to be s=
hown. I've had two or three=20

chances to size Gryson up, and he didn't impress me as a man with any abili=
ty beyond the=20

requirements of a bully and the lowest type of a political heeler."  "Tom i=
s bigger than that; I don't=20

know how much bigger, but some. He has asked Scott, with something like a l=
augh; for he could=20

see no connection.  "Mr. Gaskill asked me about the little steamer that was=
 sailing with the ship;=20

so that he had heard of her, for she came through the canal with us. I have=
 thought of this matter=20

before; and the little steamer would be a great temptation to the half-civi=
lized Arabs that inhabit=20

these shores, and they are sailors after their own fashion. I know you are =
not afraid of them,=20

Captain Scott; but it would be easy enough for these pirates to fall upon y=
ou, capture the little=20

steamer, and make an end of all on board of her."  "Where should we be whil=
