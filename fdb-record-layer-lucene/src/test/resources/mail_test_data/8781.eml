Mr. Doggett demanded that they should vote, but Will Sherman was isolated and, therefore, dependent, had to take what the employers chose to give them. And what the employers chose to give them over large districts was ten shillings a week for themselves and their _
masters' plantations "to meet the Yankees." En masse they marched breaking down fences that 

obstructed their passage, carefully avoiding "Confederate pickets" who were stationed throughout 

the countryside. After marching about five miles they reached a bridge that spanned the Savannah 

River, a point that the "Yankees" held. There was a Union soldier standing guard and before he 

realized it, this group of five hundred slaves were upon him. Becoming cognizant that someone 

was upon him, he wheeled around in the darkness, with gun leveled at the approaching slaves 

and cried "Halt!" Will's cousin then spoke up, "Doan shoot boss we's jes friends." After recognizing 

who they were, they were admitted into the camp that was established around the bridge. There 

were about seven thousand of General Sherman's soldiers camped there, having crossed the 

Savannah River on a pontoon bridge that they had constructed while enroute from Green Springs 

Georgia, which they had taken. The guard who had let these people approach so near to him 

without realizing their approach was court martialed that night for being dilatory in his duties. The 

Federal officers told the slaves that they could go along with them or go to Savannah, a place that 

they had already captured. Will decided that it was best for him to go to Savannah. He left, but the 

majority of the slaves remained with the troops. They were enroute to Barnswell, South Carolina, 

to seize Blis Creek Fort that was held by the Confederates. As the Federal troops marched ahead, 

they were followed by the volunteer slaves. Most of these unfortunate slaves were slain by "bush 

whackers" (Confederate snipers who fired upon them from ambush.) After being killed they were 

decapitated and their heads placed upon posts that lined the fields so that they could be seen by 

other slaves to warn them of what would befall them if they attempted to escape. The battle at Blis 

Creek Fort was one in which both armies displayed great heroism; most of the Federal troops that 

made the first attack, were killed as the Confederates seemed to be irresistible. After rushing up 

reinforcements, the Federals were successful in capturing it and a large number of "Rebels." 

General Sherman's set the labourers against the liberal middle class, and crowded Paris with 

operatives, bribed by employment on public works. I detest all conspiracy, whether it be that of 

Ignatius Loyola, or that of Karl Marx- -not by conspiracy, not by dark and malignant intrigue, is 

society to be reformed, but by open, honest and kindly appeals to the reason and conscience of 

mankind. Yet, let us be just, even to the Commune. The destruction of the column at the Place 

Vendome was not a good act; but if it was in any measure the protest of labour against war, it was 

a better act than ever was done by the occupant of that column. On that column it was that, when 

Napoleon's long orgy of criminal glory was drawing to a close, the hand of misery and 

bereavement wrote "Monster, if all the blood you have shed could be collected in this square, you 

might drink without stooping." Thiers is shooting the Communists; perhaps justly, though humanity 

will be relieved when the gore ceases to trickle, and vengeance ends its long repast. But Thiers 

has himself been the literary arch-priest of Napoleon and of war: of all the incendiaries in France, 

he has been the worst.  The Trade Unions are new things in industrial history. The guilds of the 

Middle Ages, with which the unions are often identified, were confederations of all engaged in the 

trade, masters as well as men, against outsiders. The Unions are confederations of the men 

against the masters. They are the offspring of an age of great capitalists, employing large bodies 

of hired workmen. The workmen, needy, and obliged to sell their labour without reserve, that they 

might eat bread, found themselves, in their isolation, very much at the mercy of their masters, and 

resorted to union as a source of strength. Capital, by collecting in the centres of manufacture 



masses of operatives who thus became conscious of their number and their force, gave birth to a 

power which now countervails its own. To talk of a war of labour against capital generally would, of 

course, be absurd. Capital is nothing but the means of undertaking any industrial or commercial 

enterprise, of setting up an Allan line of steamships or setting up a costermonger's cart. We might 

as well talk of a war of 


_
of way for them to pass. At this point of the war, many of the slaves were escaping from their 

plantations and joining the "Yankees." All of those slaves at Black Swamp who did not voluntarily 

run away and go to the "Yankees" were now free by right of conquest of the Federals.  Will now 

found himself in Savannah, Georgia, after refusing to go to Barnswell, South Carolina, with the 

Federals. This refusal saved him from the fate of his unfortunate brothers who went. Savannah 

was filled with smoke, the aftermath of a great battle. Lying in the  Capital is the fruit of labour 

past, the condition of labour present, without it no man could do a stroke of work, at least of work 

requiring tools or food for him who uses them. Let us dismiss from our language and our minds 

these impersonations, which though mere creatures of fancy playing with abstract nouns end by 

depraving our sentiments and misdirecting our actions, let us think and speak of capital 

impersonally and sensibly as an economical force and as we would think and speak of the force of 

gravitation. Relieve the poor word of the

between Beaufort, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia were two Union gun boats, the 

_Wabash_ and _Man O War_, which had taken part in the battle that resulted in the capture of 

Savannah. Everything was now peaceful again; Savannah was now a Union city. Many of the 

slaves were joining the Union army. Those slaves who joined were trained about two days and 

then sent to the front; due to lack of training they were soon killed. The weather was cold, it was 

February, 1862, frost was on the ground. Will soon left Savannah for Beaufort, South Carolina 

which had fallen before the "Yankee" attack. Soldiers and slaves filled the streets. The slaves 

were given all of the food and clothes that they could carry--confiscated goods from the "Rebels." 

After a bloody struggle in which both sides lost heavily and which lasted for about five years, the 

war finally ended May 15, 1865. Will was then a young man twenty-three years of age and was 

still in Beaufort. He says that day was a gala day. Everybody celebrated (except the Southerners). 

The slaves were _free_.  Thousands of Federal soldiers were in evidence. The Union army was 

victorious and "Sherman's March" was a success. Sherman states that when Jefferson Davis was 

which is a greatness thrust upon it, its tyranny, and the burning hatred of its tyranny will at once 

cease. Nevertheless, the fact remains that a working man standing alone, and without a breakfast 

for himself or his family, is not in a position to obtain the best terms from a rich employer, who can 

hold out as long as he likes or hire other labour on the spot. Whether Unionism has had much 

effect in producing a general rise of wages is very doubtful. Mr. Brassey's book, "Work and 

Wages," goes far to prove that it has not, and that while, on the one hand, the unionists have been 

in a fool's paradise, the masters, on the other, have been crying out before they were hurt. No 

doubt the general rise of wages is mainly and fundamentally due to natural causes: the 

accumulation of capital, the extension of commercial enterprise, and the opening up of new 

countries, which have greatly increased the competition for labour, and consequently, raised the 

price, while the nominal price of labour as well as of all other commodities has been raised by the 

influx of gold. What Unionism, as I think, has evidently effected, is the economical emancipation of 

the working man. It has rendered him independent instead of dependent,

Sherman states that Florida had the reputation of having very cruel masters. He says that when 

slaves got very unruly, they were told that they were going to be sent to Florida so they could be 

handled. During the war thousands of slaves fled from Virginia into Connecticut and New 

Hampshire. In a serf, as he was before. It has placed him on an equal footing with his employer, 

and enabled him to make the best terms for himself in every respect. There is no employer who 

does not feel that this is so, or whom Mr. Brassey's statistics, or any statistics, would convince that 

it is not.

Florida to live. He remained there until 1890, then moved to Arona, Florida, living there for awhile; 

he finally settled in Chaseville, Florida, where he now lives. During his many years of life he has 

been married twice and has been the father of sixteen children, all of whom are dead. He never 

received any formal education, but learned to read and studied taxidermy which he practiced for 

many years.  He was at one time Inspector of Elections at Mayport during Reconstruction Days. 

He recalled an incident that occurred during the performance of his duties there, which was as any 

article, or any kind of work, just so much as it is worth. But there is no economical deity who, in 

each individual case, exactly adjusts the price to the value; we may make a good or a bad bargain, 

as many of us know to our cost. One source of bad bargains is ignorance. Before unions, which 

have diffused the intelligence of the labour market, and by so doing have equalized prices, the 

workman hardly knew the rate of wages in the next town. If this was true of the mechanic, it was 

still more true of the farm labourer. Practically speaking, the farm labourers in each parish
