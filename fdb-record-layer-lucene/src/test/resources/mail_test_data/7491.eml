Come, boy; will you read me that tale to-morrow?"  "Yes, Your Majesty; if y=
ou will give your kingly=20

word that the truce shall last until the story be finished," replied Harold=
.  "Ho-hum!" the Red King=20

hesitated. He mumbled and he grumbled; he winked and he blinked. But at las=
t he said grudgingly,=20

"Well, I promise. No soldier shall advance, no weapon shall be discharged u=
ntil I have heard the=20

tale of your Wonder-Garden."  With this promise, Harold joyfully hastened b=
ack to the beleaguered=20

city. Kisington was safe for another day! The Lord Mayor and the Librarian =
shook hands and went=20

to congratulate Harold's mother.  As for Red Rex, he dreamed that Harold ha=
d bewitched him with=20

a red-and-gold book; as perhaps he had done. Were not Richard and Robert at=

There never were seen such beautiful gardens as bloomed in Kisington-by-the=
-Sea. Not only=20

every chateau and villa had its parterres spread with blooming rugs of all =
colors; but each white-

washed cottage, every thatched hut, boasted its garden-plot of dainty posie=
s. Each had some=20

quaint device or some special beauty which distinguished it from the others=
. For there was great=20

horticultural rivalry in Kisington-by-the-Sea.  Now this was all because Hu=
gh, the Lord Mayor, who=20

was very fond of flowers, had offered a prize for the prettiest garden in t=
he town. The Lord Mayor=20

himself lived on a hill in the center of the town, in the midst of the most=
 beautiful garden of all. It=20

flowed down the hillside from the summit in ripples of radiant color,--rose=
s and lilies, pinks and=20

daffodils, larkspur and snapdragon. All the flowers of the land were there,=
 and many foreigners=20

beside.  Through the garden wound the yellow driveway by which the Lord May=
or passed in his=20

golden coach. He loved to drive slowly down this road, sniffing the fragran=
ce of his flowers; and=20

then out through the streets of the town, observing the beautiful gardens o=
n every hand,--the result=20

of his own love for flowers.  When the Lord Mayor saw all the fair maidens =
down on their knees in=20

the flower-beds, watering the buds with their little green water-pots, nipp=
ing off dead leaves,=20

pulling up scrawny weeds, coaxing the delicate creepers to climb, he would =
rub his hands and=20

say:--  "Ah, this is good! This is very good indeed! We shall have the most=
 beautiful town in the=20

world, blossoming with flowers, and the most beautiful maids in the world, =
blossoming with health=20

and sweetness like the flowers they tend. It will be hard to tell which is =
the fairer, the maidens or=20

the flowers. Hey! Is it not so, my son?"  Then he would chuckle and poke in=
 the ribs the young=20

man who rode beside him.  The Lord Mayor's son was very good to look upon; =
tall and fair, with=20

curly golden locks and eyes as brown as the heart of a yellow daisy. When h=
e drove through the=20

town with the Lord Mayor, the maidens down on their knees in their garden-p=
lots would pause a=20

moment from their chase of a wriggling worm or a sluggish slug to look afte=
r the golden coach and=20

sigh gently. Then they would turn back to their Bowers more eagerly than be=
fore. For there was=20

the prize!  [Illustration:  THE MAIDENS WOULD PAUSE TO LOOK AFTER THE GOLDE=
N=20

COACH]  You see, the Lord Mayor's son was himself part of the prize to be w=
on. The Lord Mayor=20

had vowed that Cedric, his son, should marry the girl who could show by lat=
e summer the most=20

beautiful garden in Kisington-by-the-Sea. Moreover, he promised to build a =
fine palace to overlook=20

this prize garden, and there the young couple should live happy ever after,=
 like any Prince and=20

Princess. And this was why the maids worked so hard in such as creation of =
