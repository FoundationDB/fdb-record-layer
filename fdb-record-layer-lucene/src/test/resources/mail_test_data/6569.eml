As the struggle was going on in the mind of the one-armed school-master of Colme, a woman, with a basket filled with pottles of philodendron monstera a single day since their marriage,--all combined to draw Franks to the conclusion, that a journey on Sunday was excusable in his case, if not perfectly lawful.

cousin?"  Little did Franks, himself the soul of candor and truth, suspect the perfidy and malice 

that prompted the pawnbroker's reply.  "If you're seeking them out to tell them of such a bit of good 

luck, you're a day too rushing words. "You mean, thank God he wasn't sooner, don't you, darling?" 

amended Raoul.  "Yes, of course. How stupid I am!" I murmured.  All along, then, Godensky had 

meant to get my promise and deceive me, for I had not even sent my note of defiance when this 

trick was played. Had the treaty been missing, and Raoul

anxiously.  "As sure as I am that my name's Reuben Isaacs. I saw them to the docks myself;" and 

the man turned suddenly round to a customer, perhaps to hide the smile of gratified malice which 

rose to his lips.  "Then my work is done!" exclaimed Franks, leaving the place with a sense of 

bitter disappointment. "Nothing remains for me now but to find some berth for the night." doubt

the terrible man who had so nearly beaten me in the game made me quiver even now. "You see," 

I went on, "I can think of nothing but you, and my love for you. You'll never be jealous and make 

me miserable again, will you, no matter what Count Godensky or any other wretched creature may 

say of me to you?"  "I've listened to Godensky for the last time," said Raoul. "The

And it was close upon midnight before the weary man found one.     XXIX.  Pleasure or Principle? 

Ned Franks had wished to combine cheapness and comfort in his lodging, but this appearing to be 

an impossible arrangement, he gave up the second for the sake of the first, and passed in a dirty 

boarding-house one of the most uncomfortable nights that he had ever known. Accustomed as he 

had been when a sailor to "roughing it," Ned Franks could have slept soundly in an open boat or 

under a hedge; but the suffocating atmosphere of an almost air-tight room, shared with a dirty 

Portuguese, made him, weary as he was, unable to snatch more than a few minutes of broken, 

feverish slumber, to which the name of repose could not be given. Franks was glad when morning 

broke, and he was able to rise and go forth into the air from what he considered to be "as bad as 

any black-hole."  "I wish that I were back again amongst our own green fields, or that I'd never had 

the folly to come on such a wild cruise as this," muttered Franks to himself, he being in a 

somewhat irritable mood. "Persis and I might have been now,--but there is no use regretting 

what's done. I believe that the search, useless as it has turned out, was the right thing to be 

attempted. It's our part in life to try and do our duty; and then, if it seems that we've worked in vain, 

we must remember that all is in God's hands, and that he has always some wise, good, kind 

reason for sending us disappointment or trouble." If there was one sin more than another, from 

which Franks was resolved always to "sheer off" at once, it was _mistrust_,--that gathering shoal-

ice. He had been working hard; exerting all his energies, and giving up his pleasures, not so much 

for the sake of a girl in whom he had no particular interest (for Sophy had never been a favorite of

married soon. Do you know, I'm half inclined to do as you've asked me sometimes, and promised 

you wouldn't ask again--leave the stage. I want to rest, and just be happy, like other women. I 

want love--and peace--and you."  "You shall have all, and for always," answered Raoul. "If only I 

deserved you!"  "If only I deserved you!" I echoed.  Raoul would not let me say that. But he did not 

know. And I trust that he never may; or not until a time, if such a time could come, that he would 

forgive me all things, because we are one in a perfect love.  THE END      End of Project

the fatherless and poor. What is done unto the Lord can never be done altogether in vain. When 

he bids us work for him, he bids us do so in a cheerful, trustful spirit, looking to him for a blessing, 

thanking him for success when success is granted; and, if it seem to be denied, never daring to 

doubt for a moment that _he hath done all things well_.  "Now, if this were any day but Sunday," 

thought Franks, as he walked through the street where, even at an early hour, the cries of the 

water-cress seller and the hawker unpleasantly broke on the comparative stillness, "if this were 

any day but Sunday, I'd be off by the first train, and not spend another hour in this hot, close city. 

And why should I _not_ go to-day, although it is Sunday? Would there be any harm? I should be in 

plenty of time for afternoon service at least, and should pass a much holier, as well as happier, 

Sabbath in Colme than in London. I should be with my Persis and my boy, and those who love and 

serve God, and not tossing about here like a stray bit of sea-weed on the waves. Why, in the midst 

of crowds here, I've not a single being to speak to; and I feel as lonely in a city as Crusoe rules is

think that I'd better go back at once to my home!"  Franks quickened his steps as he heard the 

shrill whistle from a railway station near, which reminded him that there are plenty of travellers 

from London, every Sunday, bound on errands of business or pleasure. The temptation to Franks 

was strong; so many excuses offered themselves to his mind for breaking the fourth
