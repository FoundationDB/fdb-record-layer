then begged us to accept a hut for the night, and he paid us every attention.  On the following 

morning, we left shortly after sunrise; the natives very civilly assisted to load our camels, and 

among the most active was my fighting friend of yesterday, who, with his nose and mouth all 

swollen into one, had been rapidly converted from a well-featured Tokroori into a real thick-lipped, 

flat-nosed African nigger, with prognathous jaw, that would have delighted the Ethnological 

Society.  "April 29.--It rained hard during the night. Our course was due west, along the banks of a 

hor, from which the natives procure water by sinking wells about twelve feet deep in the sandy 

bed, which is dry in the hot season. Throughout this country the water is bad. At 11 A.M. we 

reached Roumele; this is the last village between Gallabat and the river Rahad. The natives say 

that there is no water on the road, and their accounts of the distance are so vague and 

contradictory that I cannot rely upon the information.  "I could procure only one water-skin, and 

none of my old stock were serviceable; I therefore arranged to water all the animals, and push on 

throughout the night, by which plan I hoped to arrive by a forced march at the Rahad on the 

following morning, without exhausting both men and beasts by a long journey through an unknown 

distance in the heat of the sun. Hardly were the horses watered at a well in the dry bed of the 

stream, when Aggahr was taken ill with inflammation. I left two men to attend upon him, with 

orders to bring him on if better on the following day: we started on our journey, but we had not 

proceeded a quarter of a mile when Gazelle, that I was riding, was also seized with illness, and fell 

down; with the greatest difficulty I led the horse back again to the village. My good old hunter 

Aggahr died in great agony a few minutes after our return, and Gazelle died during the night; the 

natives declared this to be the horse sickness that was annually prevalent at this season. The 

disease appeared to be inflammation of the bowels, which I attributed to the sudden change of 

food; for months past they had lived principally upon dry grass, but within the past few days they 

had greedily eaten the young herbage that had appeared after a few showers; with this, may have 

been poisonous plants that they had swallowed unawares. We had now only one horse, Tetel, that

following morning, and to set the pace at four miles an hour, so as to reach the Rahad by a forced 

march in one rapid stretch, and thus to eke out our scanty supply of water. Accordingly we started, 

and marched at that rate for ten hours, including a halt when half-way, to rest for one hour and a 

half. Throughout the distance, the country was a dead flat of the usual rich soil, covered with 

mimosa forest. We marched thirty-four miles, steering due west for a distant hill, which in the 

morning had been a faint blue streak upon the horizon.  "Upon our arrival at the hill, we found that 

the river was some miles beyond, while a fine rugged mountain that we had seen for two days 

previous rose about fifteen miles south of this point, and formed an unmistakeable landmark; the 

name of this mountain is Hallowa. We had marched with such rapidity across this stretch of thirty-

four miles, that our men were completely exhausted from thirst, as they had foolishly drunk their 

share of water at the middle of the journey, instead of reserving it for the moment of distress. Upon 

arrival at the Rahad they rushed down the steep bank, and plunged into the clear water of the 

river.  "The Rahad does not exceed eighty or ninety yards in breadth. The rain that had recently 

fallen in the mountain had sent a considerable stream down the hitherto dry bed, although the 

bottom was not entirely covered. By dead reckoning, this point of the river is fifty-five miles due 

west from Gallabat or Metemma; throughout this distance we had seen no game, neither the 

tracks of any animals except giraffes. We were rather hard up for provisions, therefore I took 

including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of 

hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial 

support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project 

Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely 

available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation 

was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future 

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how

landed a handsome little baggar about twelve pounds weight, which afforded us a good dinner.

closely, and keep a course almost parallel. The banks of the Rahad are in many places 

perpendicular, and are about forty-five feet above the bed. This river flows through rich alluvial 

soil; the country is a vast level plane, with so trifling a fall that the current of the river is gentle; the 

course is extremely circuitous, and although, when bank full, the Rahad possesses a considerable 

volume, it is very inferior as a Nile tributary to any river that I have Literary Archive Foundation

important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The
