philodendron monstera to the kind of naturalness they are after. _An Extemp=

from his fellows, and the cultivated bloom, not the field flower, that char=

than in quantity, a condition of impulse close to the unsifted accidents of=
 life would seem to=20

promise an art notable chiefly for its volume, its indistinction and its in=
significance. But those who=20

ask art to be natural never mean completely natural. In their wiser moments=
 they are only asking=20

art not to be artificial, or at least to help them forget it is artificial.=
 They demand a =E2=80=9Crealistic and=20

romantic naturalism=E2=80=9D, or =E2=80=9Ca world of honest, and often hars=

is indicated by the fact that they find something convincingly the defendan=

admonished by the insidious Cauchon to answer truly and without evasion or =
subterfuge whatever=20

should be asked, she checkmated this move at once: "I do not know what you =
mean to question=20

me about; you might ask me things which I would not tell you." She would sp=
eak the truth on all=20

things, she said, and the whole truth, except on those things concerning he=

her visions. Not till she had been brought before them for the third time, =
worn out by their=20

persistence and by the increasing horrors of imprisonment, did she modify t=

 comedy by Sheridan=20

reassure us that we are human. Since all plays are highly artificial, natur=
alness is hardly the word=20

for the virtue of good plays; they are convincing, rather, they take us fra=

and for the moment make us forget it is not our world of everyday. Yet thos=

be natural are apparently reassured when through the imaginary world of art=
 breaks some accent=20

of ordinary speech, some aspect of our common sordidness. Here, it seems, w=

The cult of the natural at its best asks of the medium of art also, as well=
 as of the subject, that it=20

wear a common aspect, untouched by artifice. Many of the new poets take as =
their ideal =E2=80=9Cthe=20

=80=9Cinversions=E2=80=9D; the =E2=80=9Clanguage of=20

predicament, is perhaps inquests,-

her, as she said, to answer boldly. If she came from God, they asked, did s=
he think herself in a=20

state of grace, incapable of committing a mortal sin? "If I am not in a sta=
