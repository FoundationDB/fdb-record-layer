specialists most competent to deal with them. Every practising physician re=
quires thorough=20

instruction in medical jurisprudence, which, being strictly legal, is best =
taught by one whose=20

profession is the law. The general practitioner only requires so much knowl=

branches of forensic medicine as will enable him to intelligently fulfil hi=

medico-legal cases as will be forced upon him as results of his ordinary pr=
