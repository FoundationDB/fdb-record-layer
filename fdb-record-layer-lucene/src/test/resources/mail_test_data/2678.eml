 of the Settite. We descended a difficult path, and continued along the dry=
 portion of the river's bed up the stream. While we were searching for a sp=
ot to encamp, I saw a fine bull mehedehet (A. Redunca Ellipsiprymna) by the=
 water side; I stalked him carefully from behind a bed of high rushes, and =
 MARIA CZOBOR'S ROSE, THE PRECIPICE, AND THE OLD PEAR-TREE.   Madame Krisba=
y was very much interested in the neighborhood they were driving through, a=
nd asked many questions. They passed a small chapel in the wood, and Veroni=
ca explained that a rich innkeeper had once been killed there by robbers, a=
nd the bereaved widow had built this chapel on the spot.  "Perhaps out of g=
ratitude?" _
country had been watched by his spies, until he had felt assured that I had=
 no sinister motive. I=20

laughed at the idea; he replied, that we were most fortunate to have escape=
d an attack from the=20

natives, as they were far worse than wild beasts, and he immediately pointe=
d out several Base=20

slaves who were present in the crowd, who had been captured when children; =
they appeared to be=20

the same as the woolly-headed natives of the south bank of the Blue Nile, a=
nd not at all peculiar in=20

appearance. He cautioned me against bathing in the stream, or drinking the =
water in the=20

neighbourhood of our camp, as it was extremely poisonous, and would produce=
 an irritation of the=20

skin. I told him that I had discovered copper, and that I attributed the po=
isonous quality of the=20

water to the presence of that mineral. This announcement was received with =
a general expression=20

of approbation. "That is very curious," he said, "that we who live in this =
country are ignorant, and=20

that you, a stranger, should at once explain the cause of the poison." He a=
t once agreed to the=20

suggestion, as he said, that during the rains, when the torrents were full,=
 the water was not=20

unwholesome, but in the dry weather, when the supply was scanty, and the st=
ream feeble, the=20

strength of the poison was necessarily increased. He assured me that, altho=
ugh the pasturage=20

was excellent, all cattle that drank in that hor or stream became as thin a=
s skeletons.  Mek Nimmur=20

had been ignorant of the existence of copper, but he informed me that gold =
dust was common in=20

the sand of most of the ravines, and that, if I would remain in his country=
, I might discover=20

considerable quantities. I informed him that I had already discovered the e=
xistence of both gold=20

and lead. He requested me to give him every information respecting the lead=
, as he should prefer=20

it to gold, as he could manufacture bullets to shoot the Turks (as the Egyp=
tians are called by the=20

neighbouring tribes). After a long and satisfactory conversation, I made my=
 salaam, and retired.=20

Immediately on my arrival at the camp, I despatched Wat Gamma on horseback =
with Taher Noor,=20

in charge of a pair of beautiful double-barrelled pistols, with the name of=
 Tatham as the=20

manufacturer; these were loaded, and I sent a polite message, begging Mek N=
immur's acceptance=20

of the present; they were accompanied by a supply of ammunition.  In the ev=
ening Wat Gamma=20

returned with the pistols; --they had BURST! Mek Nimmur had requested him t=
o fire at a mark, and=20

one barrel of each pistol had given way; thus, the double rifle and the pis=
tols of the same name=20

"Tatham" had all failed; fortunately no one was injured. I was afraid that =
this would lead to some=20

complication, and I was much annoyed; I had never used these pistols, but I=
 had considered that=20

they were first rate; thus I had given them to Mek Nimmur as a valuable pre=
sent, and they had=20

proved their utter worthlessness. I immediately mounted my horse, and with =
my revolver in my=20

belt, and my beautiful single Beattie rifle in my hand, I galloped off to M=
ek Nimmur; he was seated=20

in the same spot, watching the harvest of them, with a golden crook, a glor=
y round his head, and=20

his hat hanging by a bit of string from his neck.  "Are you Mr. Wibra?" he =
inquired.  "Yes; and=20

you?"  "I am St. Peter."  "What do you want?"  "I wish to sign a receipt fo=
r your happiness."  "For=20

my happiness?"  "I see you cannot get your umbrella, and my friend Gregoric=
s has asked me to=20

help you. So I am quite willing to sign a paper declaring that I did not gi=
ve the umbrella to the=20

young lady."  "It is very good of you, but I have neither paper nor ink her=
e. Let us go back to the=20

village."  "I have no time for that; you know I have to be at the gates of =
Heaven, and I can't stay=20

away for long."  "Well, what am I to do, how am I to get my umbrella?"  St.=
 Peter turned his back,=20

and began to walk back the way he had come, but stood still beside a large =
oak-tree, and made a=20

sign to Gyuri to approach. Gyuri obeyed.  "I'll tell you what, my friend, d=
on't think too long about it,=20



but marry Veronica, and then you will have the umbrella too."  "Come," said=
 Gyuri, catching hold of=20

the golden crook. "Come and ask her brother to give his permission."  He pu=
lled hard at the crook,=20

but at that moment a strong hand seemed to pull him back, and he awoke.  So=
me one was=20

knocking at the door.  "Come in," he said sleepily.  It was the Mravucsans'=
 farm-servant.  "I've=20

come for your boots," he announced.  Gyuri rubbed his eyes. It was day at l=
ast, the sun was=20

smiling at him through the window. His thoughts were occupied with his drea=
m, every incident of=20

which was fresh in his mind. He thought he heard St. Peter's voice again sa=
ying: "Marry Veronica,=20

my friend, and then you will have the umbrella too."  "What a strange dream=
," thought Gyuri; "and=20

how very much logic it contains! Why, I might have thought of that solution=
 myself!"         *       *=20

*       *       *  By the time Gyuri was dressed, it was getting late, and =
every member of the=20

Mravucsan household was on foot. One was carrying a pail to the stables, an=
other a sieve, and=20

near the gate which last night's wind had partly lifted off its hinges, Gyu=
ri's coachman was=20

examining the damage done. Seeing his master advancing toward him, he took =
off his hat with its=20

ostrich feathers (part of the livery of a Hungarian coachman is a kind of r=
ound hat, with two ends of=20

black ribbon hanging from it at the back, and some small ostrich tips in it=
).  "Shall I harness the=20

horses, sir?"  "I don't know yet. Here, my good girl, are the ladies up?"  =
"They are breakfasting in=20

the garden," answered the maid he had accosted. "Please walk this way."  "W=
ell, then, you may=20

harness, Janos."  Gyuri found the ladies seated round a stone table under a=
 large walnut-tree.=20

They had finished breakfast, only madame was still nibbling a bit of toast.=
 He was received with=20

ironical smiles, and Veronica called out:  "Here comes the early riser!"  "=
That title belongs to me,"=20

said Mravucsan, "for I have not been to bed at all. We played cards till da=
ybreak. Klempa is still=20

asleep with his beard sealed to the table."  "A nice sort of thing for grow=
n-up folks to do!" remarked=20

Mrs. Mravucsan.=20


_
which were being thrashed by a number of Abyssinians. The instant that I ar=
rived, I went straight=20

to him, and explained my regret and disappointment at the failure of the pi=
stols, and I begged him=20

to take his choice between my rifle and revolver. He behaved remarkably wel=
l; he had begged my=20

messenger to leave the broken pistols with him, and not to mention the circ=
umstance to me, as he=20

felt sure that I should feel even more annoyed than himself; he now decline=
d my offer, as he said I=20

should require the weapons during my proposed journey up the White Nile, an=
d he could not=20

deprive me of their use. He was afraid of the revolver, as it was too compl=
icated, but I tore from my=20

note-book a small piece of paper, which I requested one of his people to st=
ick upon a rock about=20

ninety yards distant. I took a steady shot with the single rifle, and was f=
ortunate enough to hit the=20

paper exactly. This elicited general applause, and Mek Nimmur called one of=
 his people, an=20

Abyssinian, who he declared to be a celebrated shot, and he requested that =
he might be allowed=20

to fire the rifle. I placed a similar mark upon the rock, and the Abyssinia=
n fired from a rest, and=20

struck the stone, in a good line, about six inches below the paper. The cro=
wd were in raptures with=20

the rifle, which I at once insisted upon Mek Nimmur accepting. I then made =
my salaam, and=20

mounted my horse amidst general expressions of approval.  On the following =
morning, Mek=20

Nimmur sent us two camel-loads of corn; a large gourd of honey, weighing ab=
out fifty pounds; and=20

four cows that must have been a detachment of Pharaoh's lean kine, with a p=
olite message that I=20

was to select the FATTEST. These cattle were specimens of the poisonous qua=
lities of the water;=20

but, although disappointed in the substance of the present, my people were =
delighted with the=20

acquisition, and they immediately selected a cow; but just as they were lic=
king their lips at the=20

prospect of fresh meat, which they had not tasted for some days, the cow br=
oke away and made=20

off across country. In despair at the loss, my men followed in hot pursuit,=
 and two of the Tokrooris=20

overtook her, and held on to her tail like bull-dogs, although dragged for =
some distance, at full=20

gallop through thorns and ruts, until the other men arrived and overpowered=
 the thin, but wiry=20

animal. When slaughtered, there was a great squabble between my men and the=
 Abyssinians,=20

who endeavoured to steal the meat.   CHAPTER XVIII.  A CAMEL FALLS, AND DIE=
S.  I=20

EXTRACT a few notes from my journal:--  "March 25, 1862.--Mai Gubba is abou=
t twelve miles=20

E.N.E. of our camp. Mek Nimmur's stronghold is upon a lofty table-mountain,=
 due south of this=20

spot, from which great elevation (about 5,000 feet) the granite mountain of=
 Cassala is said to be=20

plainly visible.  "March 27.--We started for the Bahr  Gyuri shook hands wi=
th them all, and=20

Veronica got up and made a deep courtesy.  "Good-morning, early riser," she=
 said. "Why are you=20

staring at me so?"  "I don't know how it is," stammered Gyuri, gazing at th=
e girl's beautiful face,=20

"but you seem to me to have grown."  "In one night?"  "You were quite a lit=
tle girl yesterday."  "You=20

appear to be dazed!"  "I certainly am when I look at you."  "You seem to be=
 sleepy still. Is this the=20

time of day to get up?"  The playful, gentle tone was delightful to Gyuri, =
and he began to be quite=20

talkative.  "I fell asleep for a short time, and if the servant had not wok=
e me, I should be asleep=20

still. Oh, if he had only waited five minutes longer!"  "Had you such a ple=
asant dream?" asked Mrs.=20

Mravucsan. "Will you take some coffee?"  "If you please."  "Won't you tell =
us your dream?"  "I was=20

going to marry--in fact, had got as far as the proposal."  "Did she refuse =
you?" asked Veronica,=20

raising her head, the beauty of which was enhanced by the rich coronet of h=
air, in which she had=20

stuck a lovely pink.  "I don't know what would have happened, for at the cr=
itical moment the=20

servant woke me."  "What a pity, we shall never know how it would have turn=
ed out!"  "You shall=20



know some time."  "How?"  "I will tell you."  "How can you do that? Dreams =
cannot be continued=20

from one night to another like novels in a periodical."  Gyuri drank his co=
ffee, lit a cigar, and from=20

out the cloud of smoke he replied in a mysterious voice, his eyes turned he=
avenward:  "There are=20

such dreams, as you will see. And how did you sleep?"  Thereupon Mrs. Mravu=
csan began to tell=20

the story of Veronica's adventure with the kitten. Every one laughed, poor =
Veronica was covered=20

with blushes, and Mrs. Mravucsan, finding the opportunity a good one, launc=
hed upon a little=20

lecture.  "My dear child, exaggeration is never good, not even in modesty. =
You will have to get=20

used to such things. What will you do when you are married? You will not be=
 able to shut your=20

husband out of your room."  "Oh, dear!" exclaimed Veronica. "How can you sa=
y such dreadful=20

things!"  And she jumped up, blushing furiously, and ran away to the gooseb=
erry-bushes, where=20

her dress got caught, and in trying to move on, the gathers got torn. There=
upon there was a rush=20

for needle and thread, and the confusion was heightened when the carriage d=
rove up, the two=20

handsome black horses pawing the ground impatiently.  (The lawyer's busines=
s must be a good=20

one; he must have lied a lot to be able to buy such horses!)  Every member =
of the household had=20

some task allotted to her. Anka must wrap up the ham in a cloth, Zsuzsa mus=
t run and fetch the=20

fresh bread that had been baked for the occasion. Some one else must bring =
knives and forks.=20

Would they like a little fruit packed in the basket? The foreign lady would=
 be glad=20


_
Mek Nimmur, as we passed his position on our march; he had given us a guide=
; an awful-looking=20

scoundrel.  "We had hardly marched two miles, when one of the baggage-camel=
s suddenly fell=20

down to die; the Arabs immediately cut its throat with a sword, and Bacheet=
, having detached one=20

ear as a witness of its death, galloped back to borrow a fresh camel of Mek=
 Nimmur, which he very=20

kindly sent without delay. We were obliged to bivouac on the spot for the n=
ight, as the Arabs=20

required the flesh of their camel, which was cut into thin strips. As they =
were employed in skinning=20

it, they ate large quantities raw and quivering. The stream, or hor, that f=
lows through this country,=20

parallel with our route, is the Ma Serdi; all this district is rich in copp=
er.  "March 28.--Started at 5=20

A.M. a small pot of jam in too?  "But, my dear Mrs. Mravucsan, we shall be =
at home by dinner-

time!"  "And supposing something happens to prevent it? You never can know.=
"  And off she went=20

to her storeroom, while the mayor tried to persuade them to stay at least a=
n hour longer; but it was=20

of no use, the travellers had made up their minds to start; not even the po=
ssibility of seeing=20

Klempa wake up would induce them to change their plans.  They got into the =
carriage, the two=20

ladies on the back seat, and Gyuri on the box with the coachman, but his fa=
ce turned toward the=20

ladies. Whether he would hold out in that uncomfortable position till Glogo=
va remained to be seen.=20

"To Glogova," said Gyuri to the coachman, and Janos cracked his whip and th=
e horses started,=20

but hardly were they out=20


_
flowing from N.N.W. and joining the Ma Serdi; also a beautiful running stre=
am of deep and clear=20

water twelve miles from our bivouac of last evening: this stream is never d=
ry; it springs from a=20

range of hills about ten miles distant. The whole of this country is well w=
atered by mountain=20

streams, the trees are no longer the thorny mimosas, but as the land is not=
 only fertile, but=20

sufficiently moist, it gives birth to a different kind of vegetation, and t=
he trees are mostly free from=20

thorns, although at this season devoid of foliage. The country is ornamente=
d by extensive=20

cultivation, and numerous villages. We halted at 5 P.M. having marched twen=
ty-one miles. The=20

fertile soil of this country is thoroughly melted by rain during the wet se=
ason, and in the intense=20

heat of the drought it becomes a mass of gaping crevices many feet deep, th=
at render hunting on=20

horseback most mayor's wife came tripping after them, calling out to them a=
t the top of her voice=20

to stop. They did so, wondering what had happened. But nothing serious was =
the matter, only Mrs.=20

Mravucsan had unearthed a few apples in her storeroom, with which she fille=
d their pockets,=20

impressing upon them that the beautiful rosy-cheeked one was for Veronica. =
Then they started=20

again, with a great amount of waving of handkerchiefs and hats, until the h=
ouse, with its smoking=20

chimneys and its large walnut-tree, was out of sight.  As they passed Mrs. =
Muencz's shop she was=20

standing at the door in her white cap, nodding to them with her gray head, =
which seemed cut into=20

two parts by the broad-rimmed spectacles. At the smithy they were hammering=
 away at the=20

priest's broken chaise, and farther on various objects which had been left =
unsold at yesterday's fair=20

were being packed in boxes, and then=20


_
Fortunately, as we halted, I observed a herd of tetel, and three ostriches:=
 the latter made off=20

immediately, but I succeeded in stalking the tetel, and shot two, right and=
 left, one of which=20

escaped, but the other became the prize of my Tokrooris.  "March 29.--Start=
ed at 5.30 A.M. and=20

reached the river Salaam at 8 A.M.; the total distance from our camp in Mek=
 Nimmur's country is=20

thirty-five miles S.W. The Bahr Salaam is precisely similar in character to=
 the Settite, but smaller; it=20

has scooped through the rich lands a deep valley, like the latter river, an=
d has transported the=20

fertile loam to the Atbara, to increase the rich store of mud which that ri=
ver delivers to the Nile. The=20

Salaam is about two hundred yards wide; it flows through perpendicular clif=
fs that form walls of=20

rock, in many places from eighty to a hundred and fifty feet above its bed;=
 the water is as clear as=20

crystal, and of tiny houses, with their brightly-painted doors, on which th=
e names of the owners=20

were printed in circles. At the last house, opposite the future Jewish buri=
al-ground, two pistol-shots=20

were fired.  The travellers turned their heads that way, and saw Mr. Mokry =
in his new suit, made by=20

the noted tailor of Besztercebanya, with his hat in one hand, and in the ot=
her the pistol he had fired=20

as a farewell greeting. On the other side of the road was the dangerous win=
dmill, its enormous=20

sails throwing shadows over the flowering clover-fields. Luckily it was not=
 moving now, and looked=20

like an enormous fly pinned on the blue sky.  There was not a breath of win=
d, and the ears of=20

wheat stood straight and stiff, like an army of soldiers. Only the sound of=
 the horses' hoofs was to=20

be heard, and the woods of Liskovina stretched before them like a never-end=
ing green wall.     The=20
