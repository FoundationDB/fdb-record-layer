"So am I," she confided frankly. And at that he gave her a swift glance whi=
ch made Ethel add to=20

herself, "Yes, he could be very personal."  She asked him what he had found=
 in New York as a=20

contrast, coming from abroad. She spoke of the high buildings here, and fro=
m that she passed=20

quite naturally to her husband's business.  "It isn't the work I'd like for=
 him," she said with a=20

regretful sigh. "Joe is getting to be like all the rest--he's making too mu=
ch money." She waited a=20

moment and added, "I should so like him to be as he was when you knew him."=
  "I'll be curious to=20

see how he has changed. You must let me see him," Dwight replied.  "Why yes=
, of course."  "Over=20

in Paris he had so much. He was such a wonderful lad for dreams--with the m=
ost exuberant fancy=20

in the way he used to talk of New York and what he wanted to do back here--=
to use the backyards=20

and the roofs and turn them into gardens. This town, when Joe got through w=
ith it--well, from an=20

aeroplane it was to look more or less like a bed of roses--or a hill town i=
n Italy. But that was only=20

his lighter vein. When his fancy was really, working hard, he took departme=
nt stores, hotels and=20

huge railroad terminals and jammed them all together into one big building.=
 How deep in the earth=20

it was to have gone I really can't remember, nor how far up into the skies.=
 But there was a garden=20

at the top--or a meadow or prairie or something."  "Yes," thought Ethel, "I=
'm going to like him."=20

"Joe could talk of his plans all night," Dwight went on good-naturedly. "An=
d keep a poor lazy=20

musician like me from my piano where I belonged."  "Was it you who taught h=
im to play?" she=20

asked.  "On the piano? It was," he replied. "Isn't his touch amazing? And s=
o thoroughly Christian,=20

too."  "Christian?"  "Yes. He doesn't let his right hand know what his left=
 hand is doing." They=20

laughed. And from that laugh she emerged with eagerness in her brown eyes. =
 "Oh, please go on,"=20

she begged him. "I had no idea you knew him so well. Did he do nothing but =
talk over there?"  "He=20

did--he worked like a tiger. Joe could stand more hard labour in one consec=
utive day and night=20

than any fellow I ever met. And he could do it night after night. I remembe=
r dropping in on him for=20

coffee and rolls one morning. A chap named Crothers and myself--" Ethel sta=
rted at the name--

"had just come home from the 'Quatres Arts Ball.' We found Joe in his room =
with the curtains=20

drawn--he didn't know it was morning yet. He had a towel bound round his he=
ad and was building=20

an opera house for Chicago--or Kansas City--I'm not sure which. And he wasn=
't just dreaming of=20

building it in his successful middle age--he was building it now, in a terr=
ible rush, as though=20

Kansas City were pushing him hard. Joe didn't live in the future, you see--=
he took the future and=20

made it the present, and then lived in the present like mad."  Dwight tosse=
d away his cigarette.=20

"But you say it's money now."  "Yes," she replied. "It's money." He smiled =
at her dejected tone.  "I=20

wouldn't be so sad," he remarked. "Money isn't as bad as it seems."  "Oh, y=
es, and I want it," Ethel=20

declared. "But I want the others so much more!"  When her car had come, she=
 rose and said, "You=20

and Joe must get together some time. Couldn't you call him up some day and =
get him to lunch=20

with you?"  "Gladly." They went to the door.  "But don't be disappointed," =
she said, "if you find him=20

changed even more than you think. Money has such a pull on a man."  "I know=
, but I rather like it."=20

"What?"  "Oh, don't be so indignant, please. I am an artist--honestly. But =
some of these men I've=20

met over here--well, they fascinate me. Such boundless energy and drive oug=
ht to go into a=20

symphony. Plenty of drums and crashing brass. Good-bye, Mrs. Lanier," he ad=
ded. "This has been=20

a lucky day for me."  "Thank you. Don't forget about Joe. And meanwhile--ti=
ll next Tuesday."  As=20

she settled back in her car she thought,  "All right, Ethel, very good."   =
Twice a week, that autumn,=20

she went to Dwight for lessons. But until some time had passed, she did not=
 mention it to Joe.=20



"When you meet him," she said to Dwight, "I'd rather you wouldn't speak of =
my lessons. I want my=20

singing to be a surprise. And besides, I'd so much rather that any old frie=
nds of my husband's=20

come to him through his partner. It seems so much more natural."  "I see," =
said Dwight. "But he=20

doesn't," she thought, "and I'll have to explain."  "Later, of course, I'll=
 tell him," she said, "But just=20

now, in the state he's in, if you or any one else of his friends who knew h=
im as he used to be=20

should come and say, 'Sent by your wife, with her compliments and fervent h=
opes of your speedy=20

resurrection '--oh, no, it wouldn't do at all." Dwight was watching her cur=
iously.  "How many of us=20

are there!" he asked. She looked at him in a questioning way.  "Of us," he =
explained, "Joe's old=20

friends, who are to dig him up, you know."  "Only you, at present--and of c=
ourse his partner. He=20

smiled:  "Bill Nourse is not a very brisk digger."  "Well," she remarked, i=
n a casual tone, "if you=20

know of brisker diggers about--people who knew him--"  "Say no more. I'll s=
earch the town." Their=20

eyes had met for an instant. "Yes," she thought, "I'm getting on."  Dwight =
lunched with Joe soon=20

after that, and later in the studio he and Ethel had a talk.  "In a good ma=
ny ways," he assured her,=20

"he struck me as the same old Joe--friendly and hospitable--he insisted on =
ordering quite a meal.=20

But we didn't eat much of it. We talked."  "Of Paris!"  "Very much so. Ther=
e's a lot of Paris in him=20

yet." And he told of their long conversation.  "Now," she said, when she ro=
se to leave, "if you'll just=20

keep at him occasionally--while his partner does the same at the office, an=
d I do what I can at=20

home--"  "You insist on his being home every night?"  "That depends," said =
Ethel gravely.=20

"Suppose I take him some night to my club. We have quite a number of archit=
ects there."  "Oh,=20

wonderful! How good of you!"  "Mrs. Lanier," said her teacher, "I'm under y=
our orders--digging for=20

gold."  He took Joe to his club on the following night, and later several t=
imes for lunch.  "Joe likes=20

it," he reported. "And he has already met some chaps who knew of him and hi=
s earlier work, not=20

only in Paris but over here, he was one of the most brilliant designers in =
the city, I find--and a good=20

many men were disappointed when he threw over his true profession and went =
after ready cash.=20

How would you like me to put up his name?"  "For club membership?"  "Precis=
ely."  "I'd like it, sir.=20

"And I obey."  "This is getting rather intimate," Ethel told herself that n=
ight. "Never mind, my love,=20

you've been perfectly honest. He knows very well what you're after. And if =
he likes you and wants=20

to help, so much the better."  Some days in the studio she stuck severely t=
o her voice and showed=20

him she meant business. She was practising quite hard, and her progress was=
 by no means slow.=20

But on other days half the hour at least was spent in learning from her new=
 friend about "a Paris in=20

New York." Dwight was already finding one, although he had been here less t=
han a year. In this=20

teeming city of endless change he had found a deep joy of creation, of newn=
ess, youth and=20

boldness that made even Paris seem far behind. "It's all so amazingly big,"=
 he said, "with such=20

revealing chances opening up on every side!" How simple it was for him, she=
 thought, with a little=20

pang of envy. A young musician with plenty of talent, easy manners, single,=
 free. As he spoke of=20

his club friends and some of their homes that were open to him, the glimpse=
s exasperated her.=20

Here were the people she wanted to know, a little world of artists, archite=
cts and writers, and=20

goodness only knew what else. She was still rather vague about them. To her=
 surprise she=20

discovered that many were after money, too. "Decidedly," her teacher said. =
"Excessively," he=20

added.  "But at least," she rejoined, defending them, "when they get the mo=
ney they know how to=20

spend it on something better than food and clothes! They really live--I'm s=
ure they do--and have=20

ideas and really grow!" She caught her breath. What an idiot, to have said =
so much! "I'm so glad,"=20



she added lamely, "that you got my husband into your club. It's bound to do=
 so much for him." She=20

threw a sharp little glance at Dwight, and scowled, for she thought she det=
ected a smile.  "He's=20

doing something for the club," Dwight was saying cheerfully. "Some of those=
 chaps are a bit too=20

refined and remote for this raw crude city of ours. And Joe is getting back=
 enough of his old vim=20

and passion, his wild radical ideas of what may still be done with the town=
, so that he jars on such=20

sensitive souls--makes 'em frown and bite their moustaches like the husband=
s in French plays. On=20

the other hand some are decidedly for him. I hear them discuss him now and =
then."  "Oh, how=20

nice!" sighed Ethel.  At times she grew so impatient to get Joe into this o=
ther world. But she had to=20

be very careful. Repeatedly she warned herself that Dwight, for all his Par=
is past and his present=20

friendliness, was very fast becoming a New Yorker like the rest: making his=
 way and climbing his=20

climb, and wanting no climbers who had to be carried. "Ethel Lanier, the fi=
rst thing you know you'll=20

be dropped like a hot potato," she thought. "There's nothing unselfish abou=
t this man. Don't make=20

him feel he has you on his hands." And she would grow studiously abstract a=
nd detached in her=20

talk about the town. But it kept cropping up in spite of her, this warm eag=
erness to "really live."=20

"It's funny," she said to Dwight one day. "I had thought of music and all t=
hat I wanted as being so=20

different from Joe's work. But now in this city that you seem to know, I fi=
nd that what I've wanted=20

most is just what he ought to want in his work! The two go together!"  "Exa=
ctly!"  "The city Joe=20

once lived in." She frowned. "There are so many cities in New York. But I d=
on't want to try to get=20

into his, until I can do it through Joe himself. People will have to want m=
e because I'm the wife of=20

Joe Lanier."  "I think they'll want you more than that." His tone was most =
reassuring. "But I like the=20

way you are going about it. It's so delightfully novel, you see--conspiring=
 to make your husband=20

find his friends all by himself--so that when he has found them he'll come =
to you with a beaming=20

smile and say, 'Woman, I bring you wealth and fame and friends in abundance=
. Take them, love,=20

and bless me--for I have done all this for you.'"  Ethel smiled. "I don't l=
ike you to joke about it," she=20

said.  "Very well," he agreed, "let's get back to the serious work of his r=
esurrection. You asked me=20

to recruit other brisk diggers, and I've hunted about quite a bit. There's =
that chap Crothers and his=20

wife, but so far they're the best I can do--and the Crothers pair seem rath=
er blind. They can't see=20

the old Joe for the new."  "You mean they think he's hopeless," Ethel scorn=
fully put in.  "Oh, we'll=20

make them open their eyes in time. I drop in on them every now and then. I =
had Crothers to the=20

club last week, and let him hear some of the gossip about the emerging Joe =
Lanier."  Often he=20

talked of the early group of students over in Paris, of their ideas, ambiti=
ons, and their youthful=20

views of life, which for all their gaiety had been so fervid and intense. B=
ut to Ethel, because she=20

herself was still young, their dreams seemed very wonderful. Some she had h=
ungrily read about=20

long ago with the history "prof" at home. But the world which the little su=
ffragist had revealed to her=20

pupils had been more heroic and severe. This was warmer, dazzling, this had=
 beauty, this was art!=20

And yet not weak nor tame nor old--this was gloriously new in the way it ja=
bbed deep into life and=20

talked of really changing it all. This was youth! And her own youth respond=
ed and she made it all=20

her own. She was reading now voraciously, with a sparkle and gleam of hope =
in her eyes. She=20

was coming so very close to her goal, or rather the gate of her promised la=
nd.  At times she grew=20

impatient at her teacher's calm, and the good-natured easy smile with which=
 he looked upon all=20

this. "Oh, why not get excited!" she thought. She felt the old dreams a bit=
 cold in him, as they had=20

been in her husband. And in dismay she would ask herself:  "Are they all to=
o old? Is just the fact=20



that I'm ten years younger than Joe and his friends going to mean that I'm =
too late--to bring back=20

what was in him!"    CHAPTER XIX  But all this was as nothing compared to t=
he intensity, the ups=20

and down, in her relations with Joe himself. He often looked tired and hara=
ssed. "What's the=20

matter with me?" he seemed to ask. And she felt his two sides combatting ea=
ch other. On the one=20

hand were the influences of Nourse and Dwight and the men at the club, to w=
hich he went nearly=20

every day. He took part in discussions there, long rambling talks and argum=
ents. And his old=20

ideals were rising hungrily within him. But meanwhile the business man in J=
oe kept savagely=20

putting the dreamer down, and for days he would plunge into his work and th=
e fever of the money=20

game. Joe had been so successful of late; and she knew that in his office t=
hat odious press agent=20

was for ever at him. From Nourse she learned that her husband was even stil=
l considering the=20

scheme for a row of buildings named after the presidents. And Ethel had a s=
inking of heart.  "If he=20

does that, I'm lost," she decided. But she would shake off such fears, as s=
he felt again the old Joe=20

emerge, the Joe of dreams and startling plans. And she grew excited as she =
thought:  "Oh, if he'll=20

only let himself go! I don't want him just nice and tame and refined! I don=
't want only friends like=20

that! I want--I want--"  What she wanted was still exceedingly vague, and E=
thel could not put it in=20

words. It had something to do with the teachings of the little history "pro=
f" at home. She wanted the=20

artist in him to rise, the creative soul of him! Cautiously she probed his =
thoughts--now tender and=20

maternal toward him in his tired moods, now alive and interested as she got=
 him talking. Bits came=20

out. Joe was so plainly tortured by the struggle going on inside. She felt =
at once pity and=20

admiration, and was deeper in love with him than she had ever been before. =
She felt the=20

excitement of a fight with hope of victory close ahead. She took care in he=
r dress and manner to=20

give him little surprises at night, and by her cheery comradeship and her w=
arm beauty of body and=20

soul, Ethel drew him on and on. At such times she would often lose all memo=
ry of her scheming=20

and would give up to her love, which had become a passion now.  But always =
she came back to=20

her plan. Not openly, for she had to be careful; she worked at him in littl=
e ways. She stirred his=20

youth and his cast-off dreams by her own youth and zest for it all. She got=
 him to tell her of Nourse=20

and Dwight, the old friends she herself had put on his trail, and of new fr=
iends he had met in his=20

club--"the club I elected you to," she exulted. But the next instant she wo=
uld add, "Oh, Ethel,=20

you're so ignorant! If you only knew about his work!" And knitting her brow=
s she would listen hard=20

while he talked of steel construction. As with her encouragement he talked =
on rapidly, absorbed,=20

Ethel would clutch at this and that. She learned of books and magazines on =
architecture here and=20

abroad. Stealthily she noted them down, and those she could not purchase sh=
e hunted up in=20

libraries. Nourse was a great help to her here. He came to see her now and =
then; and though he=20

still had his discouraging moods, at other times he was friendly and kind. =
Enjoying this conspiracy=20

with the charming young Mrs. Lanier, he expressed his gallantry by bringing=
 her books of appalling=20

size. But some had beautiful illustrations that set her to imagining. Eager=
ly she groped her way=20

deep into the history of the building of cathedrals and palaces in times go=
ne by. And the long=20

majestic story of man's building on the earth thrilled her to the very soul=
. Joe must make his place=20

in it all!  When on coming home at night he dumped a pile of work on the ta=
ble, she would=20

unobtrusively slip some book beside it. She grew to know which ones tempted=
 him most. He had=20

been surprised and amused at first at her interest in architecture--and sec=
retly a little disturbed,=20

suspecting what lay behind it. But as autumn drew on he read more and more =
of the books she=20



kept putting in his way. While he read she would sit with a novel or sew. S=
he would glance up with=20

some remark, and they would talk and then read on. Subtly she made the atmo=
sphere. She often=20

brought Paris into their talks. She spoke longingly of the shops and plays,=
 and all she wanted to=20

see over there. And she almost succeeded in making him promise to take her =
over the following=20

spring.  Joe was happy at such times, when she could make him leave busines=
s alone. And=20

although he had many relapses, when night after night he would sit by the t=
able planning more=20

horrible "junk for the Bronx," with an inner smile she saw how often her hu=
sband scowled at such=20

labour now. She heard of changes in the office.  "We 're still building jun=
k," Nourse confided one=20

day, "but it isn't quite as bad as before. Joe wants the money just as hard=
, but he's plainly jarred=20

by some of the jobs. He even fought his press agent last week!"  One night =
Joe suggested=20

awkwardly:  "Suppose we try Bill Nourse again. Let me bring him home to din=
ner, I mean. He isn't=20

especially cheery, God knows--but he seems so damnably lonely this fall."  =
"Very well, dear--if you=20

want to," she sighed. She had told Nourse to hint he was lonely.  When Nour=
se came to dinner=20

that Saturday night, Joe was surprised and delighted at the way his partner=
 seemed to get on now=20

with his wife. The visit indeed was such a success that it was not long bef=
ore Joe proposed=20

bringing home "an old pal of mine--fellow named Dwight." To this, too, Ethe=
l assented, and when=20

Dwight arrived one night she greeted him very graciously.  "I feel as thoug=
h I knew you," she said.=20

"I've heard Joe talk of you so much."  To Joe's delight they got on like ol=
d friends. And when=20

Dwight spied the piano there and learned of her interest in music, he insis=
ted on trying her voice,=20

and was loud in his praise of its promise. Before he left, it was arranged =
that she should come to=20

his studio and take lessons twice a week. Openly his pupil now, she could s=
peak of him to Joe,=20

and he came to dine with them often.   How smoothly things were working out=
. If there were any=20

cloud upon the horizon it was the occasional presence of Amy's old friend, =
Fanny Carr. Fanny had=20

been abroad through the summer, but in October she had returned. She had co=
me to see Ethel=20

several times, in the same determinedly friendly way; and Nourse reported t=
hat she was going=20

frequently to see Joe at his office about her eternal money affairs. And th=
e fact that Joe never=20

spoke of it only made the matter worse. For Joe still had his money side, a=
nd Fanny knew how to=20

flatter him so. He still had his loyalty to his first wife, and Fanny so cl=
everly played to that. "And he=20

likes her, too--clothes, voice, perfumery and all!" Ethel would declare to =
herself in anger and=20

vexation. Oh, these women who used sex every minute! how could men be so ea=
sily fooled?=20

"You can't change a man in a minute," she thought. "Remember Amy had him fi=
ve years." Amy=20

had planted so deep in him the feeling that money is everything; she had go=
t the fever into his=20

blood. And Fanny was there to keep it alive by her flattery of his money su=
ccess. And for Ethel,=20

even still, it was decidedly unsafe to criticize Joe in some of his moods. =
As autumn changed to=20

winter, these moods grew much more frequent. What was worrying him? She cou=
ldn't find out.=20

She sent for Nourse and asked him, "What's going on in the office?"  "The p=
ress agent is pushing=20

him hard," was Nourse's gloomy answer, "for that row of patriotic atrocitie=
s up on Riverside Drive."=20

Ethel squirmed.  "But he won't!" she cried. "He couldn't!"  "Oh, yes he cou=
ld," Joe's partner=20

growled. "There's so much money in it!"  "If he puts that through I'm done =
for!" Ethel told herself=20

that night. "His name will be a perfect joke--among all the people I want t=
o know! And they'll all=20

keep away from us as though he were running a yellow journal! And then her =
friends will crowd=20

about--because we'll be so rich, you see! Oh, damn money! Damn! Damn!"  She=
 was lying=20



sleepless on her bed, and Joe was sleeping by her side. She sat up now and =
looked at his face in=20

the dim light from the window.  "If you get very rich," she thought, "and m=
iddle-aged and very fat in=20

body and soul, get to care only for building 'junk' and for going about wit=
h Amy's friends--I wonder=20

what would I do then." Again the words of young Mrs. Grewe came up in her m=
ind: "You can get=20

out whenever you choose." She frowned. "But there are the children. And bes=
ides, I love you, Joe-

-yes, more than ever, and in a queer way! I'm fighting for what I love in y=
ou, but at the same time I=20

love you all--every bit of you!" Breathing quickly now, she sank back on he=
r pillow, and there she=20

soon grew quiet again. "So we'll fight it out once and for all. You've got =
to drop this plan of yours."=20

One evening that same week when Nourse had come to dinner, she led the talk=
 by slow degrees=20

to that other plan of Joe's--the one with terrace gardens. Soon she had Nou=
rse talking about it,=20

and seeing her husband grow morose she grew cheerily interested.  "Oh, I'm =
very dull, I suppose,"=20

she said at the end with a quizzical smile, "but I'm afraid I can't get it =
clear. Couldn't you draw it?"=20

Nourse smiled at this, for he saw what she was driving at.  "No, I'm poor a=
t that," he said.  "Then,=20

Joe, you sketch it out for me."  Joe put down his paper and began in surly =
fashion. But as he=20

sketched more and more rapidly, she saw the thing take hold of him. With li=
ttle exclamations and=20

questions Ethel drove him on. She thought it a fascinating plan but the det=
ails puzzled her still, she=20

said, and the rough sketch he had drawn was very unsatisfactory. She begged=
 him to draw it on a=20

large scale, and he set out to do so. But his hand was inexpert. Although o=
nce the most brilliant=20

designer in town, for years Joe had stuck to the business side, and his han=
d had grown clumsy,=20

his memory cold. Ethel had known of this from Nourse. And now probing by he=
r questions as to=20

details here and there, with Nourse helping at her side, she revealed Joe's=
 weakness to himself. A=20

scared angry look came into his eyes. Stubbornly he worked on and on, but t=
he thing would not=20

come as it used to!  registrar be satisfied by proper evidence that the per=
son claiming it is entitled=20

thereto. Appeal lies from the registrar=E2=80=99s decision to the council (=
_ib._, s. 35).  The registrar, if=20

dissatisfied with the evidence adduced, may, subject to appeal to the counc=
il, refuse registration=20

until proper evidence is furnished, duly attested by oath or affirmation be=
fore a judge of any county=20

court (_ib._, s. 36).  FRAUDULENT REGISTRATION.=E2=80=94Any entry proved to=
 the satisfaction of the=20

council to have been fraudulently or incorrectly made may be erased from th=
e register by order in=20

writing of the council (_ib._, s. 38).  If a person procures or causes to b=
e procured his registration=20

by false or fraudulent representations or declarations, the registrar may, =
on the receipt of sufficient=20

evidence of the falsity or fraudulent character, represent the matter to th=
e council, and may on the=20

written order of the president, attested by the seal of the college, erase =
his name from the register,=20

and cause notice of the fact and cause to be published in the Manitoba _Gaz=
ette_, and after such=20

notice has appeared such person shall cease to be a member of the College o=
f Physicians and=20

Surgeons, and to enjoy any privilege enjoyed or conferred by registration a=
t any further time=20

without the express sanction of the council (_ib._, s. 39).  FORFEITURE OF =
RIGHTS.=E2=80=94Any=20

registered medical practitioner convicted of felony or misdemeanor before o=
r after the passage of=20

the act or his registration forfeits his right to registration, and by dire=
ction of the council his name=20

shall be erased. If a person known to have been convicted of felony or misd=
emeanor presents=20

himself for registration, the registrar may refuse registration. If any per=
son registered be judged,=20

after due inquiry by the council, to have been guilty of infamous or unprof=
essional conduct in any=20

respect, the council may direct the registrar to erase his name (_ib._, s. =
40).  The council may, and=20



upon the application of any three registered medical practitioners shall, c=
ause inquiry to be made=20

into the case of a person liable to have his name erased from the register,=
 and on proof of such=20

conviction or such infamous or unprofessional conduct shall cause his name =
to be erased; but no=20

erasure shall be made on account of his adopting or refraining from adoptin=
g the practice of any=20

particular theory of medicine or surgery, nor on account of conviction for =
a political offence out of=20

Her Majesty=E2=80=99s dominions, nor on account of the conviction which oug=
ht not in the opinion of the=20

council or committee disqualify him from the practice of medicine or surger=
y (_ib._, s. 41).  The=20

council may order to be paid, out of funds at their disposal, such costs as=
 to them may seem just,=20

to any person against whom any complaint has been made which, when fully de=
termined, is found=20

to have been frivolous and vexatious (_ib._, s. 42).  An entry erased by or=
der of the council shall=20

not be again entered except by order of the council or a judge or court of =
competent jurisdiction=20

(_ib._, s. 43).  If the council think fit, they may direct the registrar to=
 restore any entry erased,=20

without a fee, or on payment of a fee not exceeding the registration fee, a=
s the council may fix=20

(_ib._, s. 44).  The council is authorized to ascertain the facts of any ca=
se for the exercise of its=20

powers of erasing and restoring by committee (_ib._, s. 45).  The act provi=
des in detail for=20

proceedings before such committee (_ib._, s. 46 to 50).  No action shall be=
 brought against the=20

council or committee for anything done _bona fide_ under the act. Appeal fr=
om the decision to=20

erase lies to any judge of the court of Queen=E2=80=99s Bench for Manitoba,=
 and such judge may make=20

such order as to restoration or confirmation of erasure or for further inqu=
iry, and as to costs, as to=20

him may seem right (_ib._, s. 51).  EVIDENCE.=E2=80=94In a trial under this=
 act the burden of proof as to=20

registration is on the person charged (_ib._, s. 53).  The production of a =
certificate that the person=20

named is duly registered, certified under the hand of the registrar, is suf=
ficient evidence of=20

registration, and his signature in the capacity of registrar is _prima faci=
e_ evidence that he is=20

registrar without proof of signature or that he is registrar (_ib._, s. 54)=
.  The registrar is required to=20

print and publish from time to time under the direction of the council a co=
rrect register of the=20

names and residences, with medical titles, diplomas, and qualifications con=
ferred by any college=20

or body, with the date thereof, of all persons appearing on the register as=
 existing on the day of=20

publication (_ib._, s. 55). The register is called =E2=80=9CThe Manitoba Me=
dical Register;=E2=80=9D a copy thereof for=20

the time being purporting to be so printed and published is _prima facie_ e=
vidence that the=20

persons specified are registered (_ib._, s. 56).  In the case of any person=
 whose name does not=20

appear in such copy, a certified copy under the hand of the registrar of th=
e council of the entry of=20

the name of such person on the register is evidence that such person is reg=
istered (_ib._, s. 57).=20

The absence of the name of any person from such copy is _prima facie_ evide=
nce that he is not=20

registered (_ib._, s. 58).  PRACTITIONER=E2=80=99S RIGHTS.=E2=80=94Every pe=
rson registered is entitled=20

according to his qualifications to practise medicine, surgery, or midwifery=
, or any of them as the=20

case may be, and to demand and recover full costs of suit, reasonable charg=
es for professional=20

aid, advice, and visits, and the cost of any medicine or other medical appl=
iances rendered or=20

supplied by him to his patient (_ib._, s. 59).  NEGLECT TO REGISTER.=E2=80=
=94A person neglecting to=20

register is not entitled to the rights and privileges conferred, and is lia=
ble to all penalties against=20

unqualified or unregistered practitioners (_ib._, s. 60).  UNREGISTERED PER=
SONS.=E2=80=94It is not=20

lawful for any person not registered to practise medicine, surgery, or midw=
ifery for hire, gain, or=20

hope of reward (_ib._, s. 61).  No person is entitled to receive any charge=
 for medical or surgical=20



advice or attendance, or the performance of any operation, or for any medic=
ine which he may=20

have prescribed or supplied, unless he be registered, but this provision do=
es not extend to the sale=20

of any drug or medicine by a licensed chemist or druggist (_ib._, s. 62).  =
No person can be=20

appointed as a medical officer, physician, or surgeon in the public service=
, or in any hospital or=20

other charitable institution not supported wholly by voluntary contribution=
, unless he be registered=20

(_ib._, s. 63).  No certificate required from any physician or surgeon or m=
edical practitioner is valid=20

unless the signer be registered (_ib._, s. 64).  DEFINITION.=E2=80=94The ex=
pression =E2=80=9Clegally qualified=20

medical practitioner,=E2=80=9D or any other words importing legal recogniti=
on as a medical practitioner or=20

member of the medical profession, in any law, is construed to mean a person=
 registered under this=20

act (_ib._, s. 65).  IMMUNITIES.=E2=80=94A person registered under this act=
 is exempt from jury and=20

inquest duty if he desire it (_ib._, s. 66).  LIMITATIONS.=E2=80=94No duly =
registered member of the=20

College of Physicians and Surgeons is liable in an action for negligence or=
 malpractice by reason=20

of professional services requested or rendered, unless it be commenced with=
in one year from the=20

termination of such service (_ib._, s. 67).  EXAMINATIONS.=E2=80=94The Univ=
ersity of Manitoba is the=20

sole examining body in medicine, and the council of the university may gran=
t to any person a=20

certificate under the seal of the university that the council of the univer=
sity have been satisfied that=20

the person mentioned in the certificate is, by way of medical education and=
 otherwise, a proper=20

person to be registered under this act; but such certificate shall not be g=
ranted until the person=20

making such application shall have given evidence of qualification by under=
going an examination=20

or otherwise, as the statutes of the university require, and the applicant =
shall in all other respects=20

first comply with the rules and regulations of the university in that behal=
f (_ib._, s. 68).=20

HOM=C5=92OPATHISTS.=E2=80=94Until a hom=C5=93opathic medical college for te=
aching purposes is established=20

in Manitoba, in the case of candidates wishing to be registered as hom=C5=
=93opathists, the full time of=20

attendance upon lectures and hospitals required by the university statutes =
may be spent in such=20

hom=C5=93opathic medical colleges in the United States or Europe as may be =
recognized by the=20

University of Manitoba (_ib._, s. 69).  Every candidate who at the time of =
his examination signifies=20

his wish to be registered as a hom=C5=93opathic practitioner shall not be r=
equired to pass an=20

examination in materia medica or therapeutics, or theory or practice of phy=
sic, or in surgery or=20

midwifery, except the operative practical parts thereof, before any examine=
rs other than those=20

hom=C5=93opathic examiners who shall be appointed by the University of Mani=
toba (_ib._, s. 70).=20

UNLAWFUL PRACTICES.=E2=80=94To wilfully procure or attempt to procure regis=
tration by false or=20

fraudulent representation or declaration, is punishable by a penalty not ex=
ceeding $100. To=20

knowingly aid or assist therein, is punishable by a penalty of from $20 to =
$50 for each offence=20

(_ib._, s. 73).  Persons not registered, for hire, gain, or the hope of rew=
ard, practising or professing=20

to practise medicine, surgery, or midwifery, or advertising to give advice =
in medicine, surgery, or=20

midwifery, are liable to a penalty of from $25 to $100 (_ib._, s. 74).  A p=
erson wilfully or falsely=20

pretending to be a physician, doctor of medicine, surgeon, or general pract=
itioner, or assuming a=20

title, addition, or description other than he actually possesses and is leg=
ally entitled to, is liable to a=20

penalty of from $10 to $50 (_ib._, s. 75).  For a person to assume a title =
calculated to lead people=20

to infer that he is registered, or is recognized by law as a physician, sur=
geon, or accoucheur or a=20

licentiate in medicine, surgery, or midwifery, is punishable with a penalty=
 of from $25 to $100=20

(_ib._, s. 76).  On prosecution, costs may be awarded in addition to the pe=
nalty, and the offender=20

osts are sooner paid=20

(_ib._, s. 78).  PROSECUTOR.=E2=80=94Any person may be prosecutor or compla=
inant under the act=20

(_ib._, s. 80).  LIMITATIONS.=E2=80=94Prosecutions are limited to commence =
within six months after the=20

er this act, giving notice of=20

appeal, must before being released give satisfactory security for the penal=
ty and costs of=20

conviction and appeal (_ib._, s. 82).  STAY.=E2=80=94The council may stay p=
roceedings in prosecutions=20

(_ib._, s. 84).  FEES.=E2=80=94The council is authorized to determine by by=
-law an annual fee, which is=20

ollege (_ib._, s. 32).=20

The fee for registration is subject to regulation by the council (_ib._, s.=
 33).   NEW BRUNSWICK.=20

MEDICAL SOCIETY.=E2=80=94All persons registered under the act constitute th=
e New Brunswick Medical=20

Society (Act 1881, c. 19, s. 2).  COUNCIL.=E2=80=94There is a medical counc=
il called the Council of=20

Physicians and Surgeons of New Brunswick, of nine legally qualified medical=
 practitioners, of not=20

less than seven years=E2=80=99 standing; four are nominated and appointed b=
y the governor in council, and=20

five by the New Brunswick Medical Society (_ib._, s. 3, 5).  The secretary =
of the council is the=20

registrar (_ib._, s. 7).  REGISTER, EVIDENCE.=E2=80=94The registrar is requ=
ired before May 1st annually=20

to print and publish in the _Royal Gazette_ of the province, and such other=
 manner as the council=20

shall appoint, a correct register of the names and residences and medical t=
itles, diplomas, and=20

qualifications conferred by any college or body, with the dates thereof, of=
 all persons appearing on=20

the register on the 1st of January. The register is called the Medical Regi=
ster; a copy for the time=20

being purporting to be so printed and published, or a certificate signed by=
 the president of the=20

council, and attested by the registrar with the corporate seal of the counc=
il, is _prima facie_=20

evidence that the persons therein specified are registered and qualified; t=
he absence of a name=20

from such copy or the want of such certificate is _prima facie_ evidence th=
at such person is not=20

registered. If a name does not appear on the copy, a certified copy, under =
the hand of the registrar=20

of the council, of the entry of a name on the register is evidence of regis=
tration (_ib._, s. 8).=20

ENTRANCE UPON STUDY.=E2=80=94A person beginning or entering on the study of=
 physic, surgery, or=20

midwifery, for the purpose of qualifying to practise in the province, must =
have obtained from the=20

council a certificate that he has satisfactorily passed a matriculation or =
preliminary examination in=20

the subjects enumerated in the act, unless he has passed a matriculation ex=
amination for the=20

medical course in arts and science at some college in Great Britain, Irelan=
d, Canada, the United=20

States of America, or the Continent of Europe (_ib._, s. 10).  The act pres=
cribes formalities for=20

admission to such preliminary examination (_ib._, s. 10).  QUALIFICATION.=
=E2=80=94Subject to the=20

exceptions hereinafter, no person can lawfully practise physic, surgery, or=
 midwifery unless he be=20

registered, or unless he shall have received from the council a license to =
practise (_ib._, s. 11).=20

No person is entitled to registration or license unless he shall satisfy th=
e council that he has=20

passed a matriculation or preliminary examination; that after passing such =
examination he has=20

followed his studies for not less than four years, one of which may be unde=
r the direction of one or=20

more general practitioners duly licensed; that during such four years he ha=

ners appointed by the=20

council; that he is not less than twenty-one years of age; that he has paid=
 to the registrar of the=20

council a fee of ten dollars. The council has power, subject to the approva=

. If any person apply for=20

registration as a practitioner of any system of medicine, the registered pr=
actitioners of that system=20

have the right to appoint an examiner or examiners on the subjects peculiar=
 to that system, viz.,=20

materia medica, pharmacy, and therapeutics, and if they neglect so to do th=
e council has the=20

power to appoint such examiner or examiners (_ib._, s. 12).  The last prece=
ding section does not=20

apply to persons in actual practice entitled to register under sec. 38. Any=
 person producing to the=20

council conclusive evidence that he has passed a matriculation or a prelimi=
nary examination, as=20

such conditions as the=20

council may determine, and shall pay a fee of ten dollars, shall be entitle=
d to registration and to=20

receive a license to practise (_ib._, s. 13).  The act makes special provis=
ion for residents of the=20

province who began study before January 1st, 1881 (_ib._, s. 14, as amended=
 1882, c. 30, s. 1).=20

DUTIES OF COUNCIL.=E2=80=94The council is empowered and required to regulat=

registrar is required=20

to erase the names of all registered persons who shall have died, left the =
province without the=20

intention of returning, or ceased to practise for five years; and from time=

PRACTICE.=E2=80=94No person otherwise qualified shall be refused registrati=
on or license on account of=20

the adoption or the refusal to adopt the practice of any particular theory =

N.=E2=80=94No=20

qualification can be entered unless the registrar be satisfied by proper ev=
idence that the person=20

claiming it is entitled to it. An appeal may be made from the registrar=E2=
=80=99s decision to the council. Any=20

entry proved to the satisfaction of the council to have been fraudulently o=
r incorrectly made may=20

be erased by the order in writing of the council, and the name of such pers=
on fraudulently=20

registering, or attempting to register, may, at the discretion of the counc=
il, be published in the next=20

issue of the _Royal Gazette_ (_ib._, s. 21).  FORFEITURE OF RIGHT.=E2=80=94=
A registered medical=20

practitioner convicted of felony, or after due inquiry judged by the counci=
l to have been guilty of=20

infamous conduct in any professional respect thereby, subject to appeal to =
the governor in council,=20

forfeits his right to registration, and by the direction of the council his=
 name shall be erased from=20

the register (_ib._, s. 22).  The time and place of inquiry under the prece=
ding section must be fixed=20

by the council, and at least fourteen days=E2=80=99 notice given to the par=
ty against whom inquiry is=20

ordered (Act 1886, c. 82, s. 6).  The Act of 1886, c. 82, regulates the pro=
cedure on such inquiry.=20

ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATIONS.=E2=80=94Every person registered who may obtain a=
 higher degree or=20

other qualification is entitled to have it registered in substitution for, =
or in addition to, the=20

qualifications previously registered, on the payment of such fee as the cou=
ncil may demand (Act=20

1881, c. 19, s. 23).  PRACTITIONER=E2=80=99S RIGHTS.=E2=80=94Every person r=
egistered under the act is=20

entitled according to his qualifications to practise medicine, surgery, mid=
wifery, or dentistry, or=20

either or any of them as the case may be, and to demand and recover reasona=
ble and customary=20

charges for professional aid, advice, and visits, and the cost of any medic=
ine or other medical or=20

surgical appliances rendered or supplied by him to his patients (_ib._, s. =
24).  No person is entitled=20

And this revealing process continued until Nourse with masculine pity dropp=
ed out of the torturing=20

and went home. But Ethel gently encouraged Joe, and in his dogged persisten=
cy he kept at it half=20

the night. The more tired he grew, the worse was his work. And again and ag=
ain, as she glanced=20

at his face, she saw that frightened look in his eyes. It almost brought th=
e tears in her own, but=20

steadily she kept thinking:  "I'm scaring him badly, and that's what he nee=
ds. For years he has=20

been telling himself that first he would make money and then he would work =
out his ideals. But=20

he's frightened now. He's wondering if he has put it off too long?"  Pitile=
ssly she goaded him on.=20

Then at last she relented and began to persuade him to go to bed. How white=
 and haggard and=20

queer he looked. Again a lump rose in her throat. Soon she was saying quiet=
ly:  "I should think=20

that some day, dear, you'd want to go back to Paris and work."  He made no =
answer.  But in the=20

weeks that followed, she dropped this thought again and again into his mind=
. Paris, study, work,=20

old dreams--she played these against his business, against Amy and her frie=
nds and the flattery of=20

Fanny Carr, against that odious press agent and the plan for Riverside Driv=
e.  "Has he turned it=20

down?" she inquired of his partner.  "Not yet," was the answer. "It's still=
 in the air.  "I wish this were=20

over," Ethel thought. Joe's face had grown so queer and drawn that sometime=
s as she looked at=20

him a sickening dread stole into her mind. "Is he really too old?" she aske=
d herself.  One Saturday=20

night when he came home, with a sudden leap of compassion she saw what a da=
y he had been=20

through. "But he is through! Something has happened!" she thought. And she =
treated him very=20

tenderly--both because of the state he was in, and more perhaps because she=
 knew how bad it=20

would be for both of them if he had decided against her.  "How has the work=
 been going?" she=20

asked. He looked at her almost with dislike.  "For a month," he said, "you'=
ve been trying to make=20

me give up that Riverside scheme." He paused, and her heart was in her mout=
h.  "I haven't said=20

so, have I?"  "No--you haven't said so," he growled.  "Well?"  "It's off. I=
've dropped it."  She started=20

to embrace him, but saw at once it would be a mistake.  "Thank you, Joe," s=
he said softly, and=20

went into the nursery. It was so dark and quiet there. She had a cry.    CH=
APTER XX  The next=20

morning Emily Giles returned from a visit back in Ohio.  "How have things b=
een going?" she=20

asked. "Very well indeed," said Ethel, with a scarcely perceptible smile. S=
he and Emily understood=20

each other, though very little had ever been said.  "Mr. Lanier still worki=
ng hard?"  "Yes, poor=20

dear," said Ethel, "but it has been so good for him." And at that a look of=
 grim relish came on=20

Emily's sallow face.  "You know I'm getting to like this town," she remarke=
d with a genial air. "I=20

wonder what'll the winter be like?"  "Oh, I think we'll do nicely, Emily. I=
've quite a few plans in my=20

head."  "I'll bet you have," said Emily. And she went to don her "uniform."=
  In these days, again=20

and again a sense of being just on the eve of something very exciting gave =
Ethel a new zest in life.=20

One day in the hall downstairs she came upon young Mrs. Grewe. Ethel gave a=
 little start and then=20

swiftly reddened. And she saw the young widow smile at that, and it made he=
r annoyed $100 (Act=20

1881, c. 19, s. 33).  Wilfully or falsely pretending to be or using any nam=
e or description implying=20

registration is punishable with a forfeiture of from $50 to $100 (_ib._, s.=
 34).  LIMITATIONS.=E2=80=94No=20

prosecution can be commenced under the act after one year from the date of =
the offence (Act=20

1886, c. 82, s. 4).  EXCEPTIONS.=E2=80=94The act does not prevent persons f=
rom giving the necessary=20

medical or surgical aid or attendance to any one in urgent need of it, prov=
ided it be without gain,=20

and the giving of it be not made a business or way of gaining a livelihood;=
 nor does it prevent any=20

woman from giving the necessary aid in cases of confinement as heretofore a=
ccustomed (Act=20



1881, c. 19, s. 36).  EXAMINATION.=E2=80=94All persons who subsequent to th=

the examination prescribed by the council of physicians and surgeons, or pr=
esenting approved=20

credentials, certificates, or diplomas equivalent to such examination, are =
entitled to register and=20

receive a license to practise (_ib._, s. 38).  PHYSICIANS IN ARMY OR NAVY.=
=E2=80=94A person while=20

employed in actual service in Her Majesty=E2=80=99s naval or military servi=

 s. 39).  NON-

RESIDENTS.=E2=80=94Non-resident registered practitioners of medicine residi=

in the Province of Quebec or Nova Scotia near the boundary line of this pro=
vince whose regular=20

practice extends into any town, parish, or county in New Brunswick may regi=
ster under the act=20

(_ib._, s. 44).  No other non-resident practitioner of medicine is entitled=

s. 1).  EXCEPTIONS.=E2=80=94The act does not extend to clairvoyant physicia=

c. 30, s. 6).  FEES.=E2=80=94To=20

the registrar, for registration under secs. 12 and 13, $10 (Act 1881, c. 19=

registrar, for the registration of an additional qualification, such fee as=
 the council may demand=20

(Act 1881, c. 19, s. 23).  To the registrar, or his deputy, annual fee from=
 each practitioner, to be=20

fixed by the council, not more than $2 nor less than $1 (Act 1882, c. 30, s=

medical practitioner must, if required by the council, pay to the registrar=
, or a person deputed by=20

him, an annual fee determined by the council, not less than $1 nor more tha=
n $2, payable January=20

1st each year, and recoverable as a debt with costs in the name of the coun=
cil (Act 1882, c. 30, s.=20

5).  If any practitioner omit to pay the registration fee before the regist=
rar causes the register to be=20

printed in the _Royal Gazette_, the registrar shall not cause the name of s=
uch practitioner to be=20

printed, and he shall thereupon cease to be deemed a registered practitione=
r; but afterward, on=20

paying such fee, he shall be entitled to all his rights and privileges as a=
 registered practitioner from=20

the time of payment (Act 1884, c. 17, s. 2).   NEWFOUNDLAND.  MEDICAL BOARD=
.=E2=80=94There is a=20

board composed of seven regularly qualified medical practitioners of not le=

_
been so clumsy. "I'll show her I'm not such a prude," she thought. And havi=
ng learned that Mrs.=20

Grewe had taken another apartment here, Ethel went to see her--with a safe =
little feeling that Mrs.=20

Grewe would have too much sense to return the call. This would end it--plea=
santly.  The visit was=20

a decided success. Mrs. Grewe was back from Europe sooner than she had expe=
cted--for reasons=20

she did not explain. "And now I'm looking about," she said, "for another ol=
d lady from Boston. I rent=20

a new one every year." Ethel stayed for tea. For nearly eight months she ha=
d had no woman to=20

talk to, but Fanny Carr and Emily Giles. And she found it very pleasant to =
be chatting here so=20

cosily. Not that she meant to keep it up. This sort of woman? H'm--well, no=
. But on the other hand,=20

why not? After all, New York was a very big city.  "I'm never going to shut=
 myself up in one little=20

circle of people," she thought. "I mean to keep rubbing up against life."  =
There was an added=20

pleasure, too, in the vague warm self-confidence which the young widow gave=
 to her. "You can=20

take care of yourself, my dear," said Mrs. Grewe's small lustrous black eye=
s.  "Well? Is he treating=20

you better?" she asked.  "Yes," said Ethel.  "He's very wise." They smiled =
at each other.  "He's=20

becoming quite sensible," Ethel said.  "And have you found those friends yo=
u wanted?"  "They're=20

in sight," was Ethel's answer. Her hostess smiled good humouredly.  "You wo=
n't be able to keep=20

me," she said. "He won't stand that--"  Ethel knit her brows.  "He'll stand=
 a good deal," she=20

answered, "when once I know where I stand myself."  "In the meantime you'd =
better leave me=20

alone."  The two parted in affable fashion.  "There," thought Ethel in reli=
ef. "I got through that=20

rather nicely. I needn't go again, of course."  She had started out for a b=
risk walk, and she drew a=20

deep breath of the frosty air. The air in New York was often so--gay! And M=
rs. Grewe had given=20

her such a feeling of independence. She saw a man turn and look at her--the=
 beast! But she=20

smiled as she hurried on toward the Park.  Still, the brief visit had been =
rather daring. Joe would=20

not have liked it at all. He as provided in the act, and known as the =E2=
=80=9CNewfoundland Medical=20

Board,=E2=80=9D whose duties relate, among other things, to the making and =
enforcing of measures=20

necessary for the regulation and the practice of medicine (Act 1893, c. 12,=
 s. 2, 3, 19).  The board=20

is authorized to appoint examiners and fix times of examinations (_ib._, s.=
 5).  The secretary of the=20

board is the registrar (_ib._, s. 7).  REGISTER, EVIDENCE.=E2=80=94It is th=
e duty of the registrar on or=20

before January 1st in each year to cause to be published in the _Royal Gaze=
tte_ of Newfoundland=20

a list of the names of all persons appearing on the register at that date, =
with their places of=20

residence, titles, diplomas, and qualifications as conferred by any college=
 or body, with the date=20

(_ib._, s. 8).  Such register is called the Medical Register, and a copy th=
ereof is _prima facie_=20

evidence that the persons therein specified are registered according to the=
 act; and the absence of=20

a name therefrom is _prima facie_ evidence that such person is not so regis=
tered (_ib._, s. 9).=20

QUALIFICATION.=E2=80=94The members of the board form a body of medical exam=
iners of diplomas and=20

degrees, whose certificate shall be the only license permitting the practic=
e of medicine, surgery, or=20

midwifery, except as hereinafter provided, provided the applicant for such =
license shall previously=20

have obtained a medical diploma from a recognized college or university, or=
 as hereinafter=20

provided (_ib._, s. 10.)  Every person is entitled to have his name entered=
 on the register on=20

satisfying the board that he holds a degree or diploma from some regular un=
iversity or school of=20

medicine in good standing, and he shall then receive from the board a licen=
se bearing its seal, on=20

the payment to the registrar of $5, and shall have his name entered on the =
register (_ib._, s. 11).=20

No such licensed practitioner shall be entitled to practise in any year wit=
hout taking out from the=20



board, before the 1st of January in every year, a certificate of practice f=
or which he shall pay $1=20

(_ib._, s. 12).  STUDENTS.=E2=80=94The act provides the requirements for en=
tering on the study of=20

medicine, surgery, or midwifery in the colony=20


_
"However!" She walked briskly on. "What's the difference between Mrs. Grewe=
 and his own dear=20

friend, Fanny Carr?" she asked. "Nothing whatever--except that Fanny, so fa=
r as we know, has=20

taken the trouble with each man to have a wedding and a divorce. The only o=
ther difference is that=20

Fanny has no taste at all, while Mrs. Grewe has heaps of it! And she reads =
things--even Shaw;=20

and she likes good music, too. She is going tonight to 'Salome.'" . . . For=
 a moment Ethel let her=20

mind run over all the operas she herself was going to hear, and the concert=
s, and the plays she=20

would see and the dinners she would go to, the talks in which she would tak=
e part. She could see=20

herself--just scintillating! . . . With a jerk she came back to Mrs. Grewe.=
 "Oh, I guess it isn't very=20

defiling to turn to her from Fanny Carr! I'll do as I please!" she impatien=
tly thought.  Still, it had=20

been rather daring. It fitted in exactly with several talks she had had of =
late with Dwight, her music=20

teacher: talks in which each one of them had taken rather a challenging ton=
e that had grown=20

distinctly intimate. One night when Joe was out of town she had gone with D=
wight to the opera.=20

And she had not mentioned it to Joe--not that she felt guilty at all,  DUTI=
ES OF BOARD.=E2=80=94The=20

board is required to examine all degrees and other credentials produced or =
given in evidence=20

under the act for the purpose of enabling the owners to practise, and, if i=
t be deemed necessary,=20

to oblige the owner to attest on oath or affidavit that he is the person wh=
ose name is mentioned=20

therein, and that he has become possessed of the same by lawful means (_ib.=
_, s. 16).  The board=20

is required to cause every member of the profession practising in Newfoundl=
and to enter his=20

name, age, place of residence, date of license or diploma and where it was =
obtained, on the=20

register (_ib._, s. 18).  NEGLECT TO REGISTER.=E2=80=94A person entitled to=
 be registered, who=20

neglects or omits to apply, is not entitled to any of the rights or privile=

long as the neglect or omission continues (_ib._, s. 25).  ADDITIONAL QUALI=
FICATION.=E2=80=94A=20

person registered who obtains a higher degree or diploma is entitled to hav=
e it inserted in the=20

register in addition to or in substitution for those previously registered =

REGISTERED PERSONS.=E2=80=94A person properly registered under the act is e=
ntitled to practise=20

_
love with her husband? Yes, indeed. And let Dwight or any other man try to =
go the least bit too far-

-"As Fanny doubtless does with Joe," she suddenly added to herself. For a m=
oment she walked=20

viciously. Then she thought again of Dwight. He had told her she really had=
 voice enough with=20

which to go on the stage if she chose.  "Though I hope you won't," he had a=
dded.  "Why not?" she=20

had asked. In reply he had hinted at perils that made it all sound rather t=
hrilling.  "Joe wouldn't like=20

it," Dwight had said.  "I might sing in concerts--"  "Joe wouldn't like it.=
"  "Oh, bother Joe!"  Dwight=20

had smiled a bit. "I wonder what you will do," he had said, "if Joe flivver=
s!"  "If he what?"  "Flivvers-

-drops back and makes money--turns to those other friends of his."  "He won=
't do that." But her=20

voice had been tense, for the intimate feeling in Dwight's tone had made he=
r a bit uneasy.  "Well,"=20

he had told her in a low voice, "I'm a friend of Joe's, you professional ai=
