too many hints and rumors for him to stay at home any longer. Some very ori=
ginal spirits, we may=20

suppose, took no stock in his expedition. For Shakespeare or Moli=C3=A8re p=
lay-writing was an obvious=20

task, and an old one; they may have expected to do successfully what others=
 had only tried, but=20

except for the success they aimed at nothing new. Where great poets have sp=
oken on the matter=20

themselves, their point of view is quite clear. At the end of the _Vita Nuo=
va_ Dante announced his=20

hope to write of Beatrice such things as had never been written of any woma=
n. Not to write a new=20

kind of book, for women had been praised before, as he implied, and there h=
ad been poems of=20

vision and pilgrimages through hell; but his hope was to excel. He determin=
ed to speak no more of=20

his blessed lady until he could praise her worthily, and to praise such a w=
oman worthily would be=20

to write such things as had been written of no other. In the same mood Milt=
on promised his great=20

epic=E2=80=94in passionate love of the best before him, and in the assuranc=
e of doing as well or better=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CI=20

began thus to assent both to them and divers of my friends here at home, an=
d not less to an=20

inward prompting, which now grew daily upon me, that by labour and intense =
study, which I take to=20

be my portion in this life, joined with the strong propensity of nature, I =
might leave something so=20

written to after-times as they should not willingly let it die.=E2=80=9D Th=
is is the great manner of her=20

character at this time. It is said that she became less scrupulous of shedd=
ing blood, less careful in=20

enforcing moral and religious discipline among her followers, above all, le=
ss gentle and patient in=20

temper. But Jeanne had never been able to compel absolute obedience from so=
ldiers little better=20

than banditti, and when the notion of her sanctity began to fade away as th=
e men saw her in the=20

daily life of the camp, and saw her a mere human creature, fallible like th=
emselves, her strongest=20

hold on them was loosened. She had never been, since her mission was assume=
d, a mere dainty,=20

meek, unresisting heroine of romance, a paragon of grace and beauty for who=
m knights risked=20

their lives while she sat by and smiled and dressed the wounds of the victo=
r after the fight. She=20

had definitely and from the first taken an active part in the real business=
 of fighting, had on more=20

than one occasion displayed her prowess in the field. A generation after he=
r death, when all=20

France had come to regard her as a martyr, a priest testified that "she wou=
ld not use her sword,=20

nor would she slay anyone"; but this testimony is certainly at variance wit=
h all that we know of the=20

actual behavior of Jeanne in battle, and seems sufficiently contradicted by=
 her own statement that=20

the sword she used at Compiegne was "excellent, either for cutting or thrus=
ting." She made the=20

statement frankly, without any suspicion of its apparent inconsistency with=
 her=20


_
_Confessions_, to take an opposite example, we have the accent of the moder=
n disease; he would=20

undertake, he said, an enterprise of which there had never been a parallel,=
 and of which there=20

would be no imitation=E2=80=94he would tell the truth about one man, about =
himself. He promised no=20

excellence except the uniqueness of the subject, for truth-telling, though =
always desirable, can=20

hardly be important unless the subject is worth while.  Rousseau=E2=80=99s =
book is great in spite of its=20

introductory sentence; his subject after all was not unique, for each of us=
 can follow his example=20

and write at least one book about ourselves; and perhaps he told less of th=
e unvarnished truth=20

than he intended, for being an artist in every fiber of his body, he select=
ed from his experience not=20

his most singular adventures, but his adventures in those realms of experie=
nce=E2=80=94in sex, for=20

example=E2=80=94which his readers were surest to understand and find intere=
sting. But with his famous=20

announcement, whether or not he followed it, our malady began. Hence all th=
e poems and novels=20

of autobiography, all the diaries of young men and maidens, old men and chi=
ldren, all the=20

bouquets of verse still showered upon us in which the poet confides his int=
imate symptoms. In all=20

this there is little to remind us of great art, or of the times in which gr=
eat art has been made; the=20

resemblance is rather to a hospital or an old folks=E2=80=99 home, where th=
e inmates find importance in the=20

fact that they have been there longer than their fellows, or are younger, o=
r a little less blind and=20

deaf. Hence also our difficulty in understanding earlier literature, of a d=
ate when not originality but=20

excellence was the aim. When we first read Shakespeare=E2=80=99s sonnets or=
 Sidney=E2=80=99s, we conclude with=20

satisfaction that the poet was writing out of his heart, in the Rousseau fa=
shion. But when we learn=20

that these stories are works of art, dramatic renderings of life, and that =
the =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D who speaks in of a=20

divine mission. We have no doubt that Jeanne delivered many a good stroke i=
n deadly earnest,=20

and we do not respect her the less for it. We need not even sorrow, but rat=
her rejoice, at that=20

display of honest indignation against the unruly and immoral in her camp, w=
hen she broke her=20

sword of Saint Catherine over one rascal's head.  Town after town had throw=
n open its gates at=20

sight of the white banner and the Maid of Orleans; but Paris still remained=
 in the hands of the=20

English. Jeanne was averse to making any attack upon Paris; her heart misga=
ve her, but she=20

yielded to the will of the king. The assault that followed (September 8, 14=
29), in which she=20

behaved with desperate but hopeless courage, fighting on in spite of a seve=
re wound, resulted in a=20

disastrous repulse, the French losing heavily. Jeanne, who had opposed maki=
ng the attack, was=20

nevertheless held responsible for the result. Faith in her was rudely shake=
n, and even those=20

courtiers who had fawned upon her now said that her impiety--they, of cours=
e, were qualified to=20

pronounce upon such a point--had been fitly rebuked in this defeat: had she=
 not ventured to=20

deliver the assault upon the anniversary of the Nativity of Our Lady? "The =
Armagnacs," says the=20

journal of a pious citizen of Paris, "were so filled with wickedness and un=
belief, that, on the word of=20

a creature in the shape of a woman with them, called La Pucelle (what it mi=
ght be God alone=20

knows!), they conspired on the anniversary of the Nativity of Our Lady... t=
o attack Paris."  Jeanne,=20

utterly disheartened by her defeat, and half believing that she had merited=
 this rebuke from=20

heaven, humbled herself before God and before the king, and renounced her a=
rms, laying her=20

sword upon the altar of Saint-Denis. But though willing to shift the blame =
for failures upon her,=20

Charles was not willing to dispense with her services if there was anything=
 more to be hoped from=20

them. She was induced to take=20


_
story, whether or not he is the poet too; and when we learn further that mu=
ch of the material is=20

adapted from earlier poets, used over again as we use old words to make up =
new=20

sentences=E2=80=94then perhaps our respect for the master vanishes, our ide=
al is again; but we will pass=20

over in silence the details of her later valiant but hopeless service and s=
peak only of her last feat of=20

arms.  The Burgundians, though their duke was already in secret corresponde=
nce with Charles,=20

had laid siege to Compiegne.=20


_
poets after all. It is the defect of our taste. We forget that the oldest p=
hrases, if they have the=20

poetic excellence of being true to all of us, are renewed and become person=
al in the adventure of=20

each individual. Though Job ought to get the credit, by all modern standard=
s, of troops succeeded=20

in forcing her way into the town, and that same day (May 23, 1430) led a so=
rtie that at first drove=20

back the besiegers. The Burgundians rallied, however, and Jeanne's troops w=
ere beaten back into=20

the town. As she herself, bringing up the rear in the retreat,=20
