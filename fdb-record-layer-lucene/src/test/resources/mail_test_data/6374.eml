little children were playing about and giving each other rides in home-made=
 hand-carts, and at one=20

point the girls stood aside to let pass a donkey so loaded with tiny bamboo=
 trees that it looked a=20

mere moving mass of green.  At length the deep alley between the orange orc=
hards gave way to a=20

different scene. They had been climbing steadily uphill, and now found them=
selves above the fruit=20

zone and among the olive groves. The high walls had disappeared, and the pa=
th ascended by a=20

series of steps. Gray olive trees were on either side, and on the bordering=
 banks grew lovely wild=20

flowers, starry purple anemones, jack-in-the-pulpit lilies, yellow oxalis, =
moon-daisies, and the=20

beautiful genista which we treasure as a conservatory plant in England. As =
it was country the girls=20

were allowed to break rank, and keenly enjoyed gathering bouquets; they scr=
ambled up the banks,=20

vying with one another in getting the best specimens. The view from the hei=
ghts was glorious:=20

below them stretched the gray-green of the olive groves, broken here and th=
ere by the bright pink=20

blossoms of a peach tree; the white houses of Fossato gleamed among the dar=
k glossy foliage of=20

its orange orchards, and beyond stretched the beautiful bay of Naples, with=
 its sea a blaze of blue,=20

and old Vesuvius smoking in the distance like a warning of trouble to come.=
  It was at this point of=20

the walk that Irene, foolish, luckless Irene, made a fatal mistake, and, as=
 Miss Bickford afterwards=20

told her, "wrecked the whole excursion and spoiled everybody's pleasure." S=
he beckoned Lorna=20

and ran up a hill to obtain a higher vantage ground, then, instead of desce=
nding by the route she=20

had come, she insisted upon taking a short cut to rejoin the path and catch=
 up with the rest of the=20

party. Now neither Lorna nor Irene was aware that the mountain was a networ=
k of many paths=20

leading to little vineyards and gardens, and that when they ran down the op=
posite side of the slope=20

they were striking a fresh alley, altogether different from the one along w=
hich Miss Bickford was=20

leading her flock. For quite a long way the two girls walked on, thinking t=
hey were in advance of=20

the others and had stolen a march upon them. Then they sat down and waited,=
 but nobody came.=20

It was a considerable time before it dawned upon them that they were separa=
ted from the rest of=20

the party.  "We've come wrong somehow," said Lorna, in much consternation. =
 "What had we=20

better do?"  "I don't know."  "Perhaps they're not far off. I'll try if I c=
an make them hear."  "I wouldn't=20

shout," objected Lorna, but she was too late, for Irene was already letting=
 off her full lung power in=20

a gigantic coo-e-e. It had a totally different effect from what she anticip=
ated. No schoolgirls with=20

Villa Camellia hats made their appearance, but some rough looking Italian y=
ouths scrambled over=20

a fence and came sniggering towards them. Their manner was so objectionable=
 and offensive that=20

the girls turned and ran. They pelted down the path anywhere, quite oblivio=
us of the direction they=20

were taking, and, as a matter of fact, branching yet farther away from thei=
r original route. They=20

could hear footsteps and giggling laughter behind, and they were growing ex=
tremely terrified when=20

to their immense relief they saw in front of them an elderly peasant woman =
coming from the town.=20

She had a bright yellow handkerchief round her neck and carried on her head=
 a big basket=20

containing flasks of oil, loaves of bread, and some vegetables. She stopped=
 in some astonishment=20

as Lorna and Irene rushed panting up to her, then glimpsing the lads she se=
emed to grasp the=20

situation, and called out angrily to them in Italian, whereupon they prompt=
ly and rapidly=20

disappeared. As she had reached the gateway of her own garden she motioned =
the girls to enter,=20

and they gladly availed themselves of the opportunity to seek sanctuary. A =
large archway led into=20

a paved courtyard, on one side of which was a little brown house, and on th=
e other a small chapel,=20

quite a picture with its quaint half-Moorish tower and two large bells. The=
ir new friend seemed to=20



be the caretaker, for she escorted them inside to show them, with much prid=
e, an altar-piece=20

attributed to Perugino and some ancient faded frescoes of haloed saints. Sh=
e gave them a peep=20

into her house too, and they were deeply interested to see the unfamiliar f=
oreign home, not=20

comfortable according to British or American ideas of comfort, but with a c=
ertain charm of its own.=20

There was a big dark room on the ground floor with an orange press, various=
 agricultural=20

implements, and numberless baskets for gathering fruit; there was a bare ki=
tchen with a wood fire=20

and a table spread with cups and dishes; then up a winding stair was a bedr=
oom with walls=20

colored sky blue, and a veranda that looked down over a glorious orange orc=
hard.  "Oh, I'd adore=20

to go out there!" said Irene, pointing to the path that led between the fru=
it-laden trees, and their=20

hostess evidently divined her meaning, for she not only led her guests into=
 the garden, but fetched=20

a ladder, climbed a tree, and plucked each of them a whole cluster of orang=
es surrounded by a=20

bunch of leaves.  The girls were so delighted with their entertainment in t=
his Italian cottage that=20

they hardly wished to tear themselves away, yet a vision of Miss Bickford's=
 reproachful face began=20

to hover before their eyes, and Lorna at last suggested that they must be m=
oving.  "I hope those=20

abominable boys aren't waiting about anywhere outside," shivered Irene.  Th=
e same thought=20

seemed to have struck their hostess, for she called an elderly man, evident=
ly her husband, who=20

was pruning vines, and began a catechism as to where her visitors lived. Lo=
rna replied as well as=20

her knowledge of Italian allowed, and at the mention of the Villa Camellia =
the pair nodded in=20

comprehension. After a brief conversation with his wife in an undertone the=
 old man offered=20

himself as guide, and undertook to escort the truants safely back to school=
 again, a proposal=20

which they thankfully accepted. It would indeed have been difficult for the=
m to find their own way=20

among the various interlacing paths, and they were particularly glad to hav=
e his protection against=20

possible _ragazzi_. There was tremendous trouble waiting for them at the Vi=
lla Camellia. Poor=20

Miss Parr had collapsed almost into hysterics, and Miss Bickford with two o=
ther teachers had=20

returned to the hillside on a further search, while Miss Rodgers was commun=
icating by telephone=20

with the Fossato police station, and offering a reward for any news of thei=
r whereabouts. Irene had=20

thought the principal could be stern, but she never knew how her eyes could=
 flash before that=20

interview in the study. Both girls came out quaking like jellies and weepin=
g for all to hear.  "Did you=20

catch it hot?" inquired Peachy, sympathetically linking arms with the truan=
ts.  "Rather! It isn't the=20

punishments so much, it's that she made us so _ashamed_."  "Our parole won'=
t be trusted till after=20

half-term."  "We didn't _mean_ to run away."  "It was really quite an accid=
ent."  "Cheer up!"=20

consoled Peachy. "Miss Rodgers cuts like a steel knife, but she doesn't bea=
r grudges. I will say=20

that for her. With some teachers you'd never hear the last of it, but once =
you've worked off your=20

impositions you'll be quite in favor again. Whatever possessed you to go an=
d do it though?"  "Just=20

our wretched bad luck, I suppose," said Irene, rubbing her eyes as she turn=
ed up the passage and=20

deposited her confiscated cluster of oranges, as directed, in the pantry.  =
   CHAPTER VII  Lorna's=20

Enemy   For the next two weeks Irene and Lorna were strictly "gated," a gre=
at deprivation, for it=20

would have been their turns to go shopping with Miss Morley, and Irene at l=
east was anxious to=20

sample some of the quaint wares spread forth so temptingly in the Fossato s=
tores. With the=20

exception of church-going they did not have a chance to step outside the gr=
ounds of the Villa=20

Camellia. The Sunday expedition came as a welcome relief to break the monot=
ony. The school=20

liked the little British church at Fossato. It was so utterly different fro=
m anything to which they had=20



been accustomed in England or America. To begin with it was not an ecclesia=
stical building at all,=20

but simply a big room in the basement of the Hotel Anglais. The walls had b=
een exquisitely=20

decorated by a French artist with conventionalized designs of iris in purpl=
e and gold, and through=20

the windows there was a gorgeous peep over the bay. The girls used to exerc=
ise much=20

maneuvering to secure the seats with the best view, and somehow that bright=
 stretch of the=20

Mediterranean seemed to blend in as part and parcel of all the praise and t=
hanksgiving that was=20

being offered.  Punctually at twenty minutes to eleven on Sunday mornings t=
he fifty-six pupils and=20

the seven mistresses would leave the great gate of the Villa Camellia and m=
arch into the town,=20

along the esplanade under the grove of palm trees, then through the beautif=
ul sheltered garden of=20

the Hotel Anglais, where many exotic flowers and shrubs were blooming and t=
he white arum lilies=20

were like an Easter festival, to the doorway, under the jessamine-covered v=
eranda, that led to the=20

_Eglise anglaise et americaine_. The school practically made half the congr=
egation, but there=20

were visitors from the various hotels, and a sprinkling of British resident=
s who had houses at=20

Fossato. When the service was over there followed a very pleasant quarter o=
f an hour in the=20

piazza of the hotel; the clergyman and his wife would speak personally to m=
any of the girls, and=20

any of the pupils who met friends were allowed to talk to them. Fossato was=
 a popular week-end=20

resort from Naples, so relatives often turned up on Sundays and there were =
many joyous=20

reunions. Kind little Canon Clark and his small bird-like wife were great f=
avorites at the Villa=20

Camellia. They were always invited to school functions, and each term the g=
irls, in relays of about=20

ten at a time, were offered hospitality at the "Villa Bleue," a tiny dwelli=
ng that served as parsonage=20

for the British chaplain. To go to tea at the dear wee house--color-washed =
blue, and with pink=20

geraniums in its window-boxes--was considered a treat, and Irene and Lorna =
looked very glum=20

indeed when Miss Rodgers kept severely to their punishment, and substituted=
 Agnes and Elsie for=20

themselves in the next contingent of guests.  "You'll go later on," console=
d Peachy. "Miss Rodgers=20

is really very decent in that way. She'll see that you get your turn once i=
n a term at any rate. Last=20

time I went we had hot brown scones and molasses. Oh, they were good! There=
! I oughtn't to have=20

told you that when your turn's off. Never mind. It will be something to loo=
k forward to. We always=20

play paper basin of Saint Ferreol lose every year from 0.758 met. to 0.812 =
met., or from 336 to=20

360 lines. M. de Prony found nearly similar results in the Pontine marshes.=
 The whole of these=20

experiments, made in the latitudes of 41 and 49 degrees, and at 10.5 and 16=
 degrees of mean=20

temperature, indicate a mean evaporation of one line, or one and three-tent=
hs a day. In the torrid=20

zone, in the West India Islands for instance, the effect of evaporation is =
three times as much,=20

according to Le Gaux, and double according to Cassan. At Cumana, in a place=
 where the=20

atmosphere is far more loaded with humidity than in the valley of Aragua, I=
 have often seen=20

evaporate during twelve hours, in the sun, 8.8 mill., in the shade 3.4 mill=
.; and I believe, that the=20

annual produce of evaporation in the rivers near Cumana is not less than on=
e hundred and thirty=20

inches. Experiments of this kind are extremely delicate, but what I have st=
ated will suffice to=20

demonstrate how great must be the quantity of vapour that rises from the la=
ke of Valencia, and=20

from the surrounding country, the waters of which flow into the lake. I sha=
ll have occasion=20

elsewhere to resume this subject; for, in a work which displays the great l=
aws of nature in different=20

zones, we must endeavour to solve the problem of the mean tension of the va=
pours contained in=20

the atmosphere in different latitudes, and at different heights above the s=
urface of the ocean.  A=20



great number of local circumstances cause the produce of evaporation to var=
y; it changes in=20

proportion as more or less shade covers the basin of the waters, with their=
 state of motion or=20

repose, with their depth, and the nature and colour of their bottom; but in=
 general evaporation=20

depends only on three circumstances, the temperature, the tension of the va=
pours contained in the=20

atmosphere, and the resistance which the air, more or less dense, more or l=
ess agitated, opposes=20

to the diffusion of vapour. The quantity of water that evaporates in a give=
n spot, everything else=20

being equal, is proportionate to the difference between the quantity of vap=
our which the ambient=20

air can contain when saturated, and the quantity which it actually contains=
. Hence it follows that=20

the evaporation is not so great in the torrid zone as might be expected fro=
m the enormous=20

augmentation of temperature; because, in those ardent climates, the air is =
habitually very humid.=20

Since the increase of agricultural industry in the valleys of Aragua, the l=
ittle rivers which run into=20

the lake of Valencia can no longer be regarded as positive supplies during =
the six months=20

succeeding December. They remain dried up in the lower part of their course=
, because the=20

planters of indigo, coffee, and sugar-canes, have made frequent drainings (=
azequias), in order to=20

water the ground by trenches. We may observe also, that a pretty considerab=
le river, the Rio Pao,=20

which rises at the entrance of the Llanos, at the foot of the range of hill=
s called La Galera,=20

heretofore mingled its waters with those of the lake, by uniting with the C=
ano de Cambury, on the=20

road from the town of Nueva Valencia to Guigue. The course of this river wa=
s from south to north.=20

At the end of the seventeenth century, the proprietor of a neighbouring pla=
ntation dug at the back=20

of the hill a new bed for the Rio Pao. He turned the river; and, after havi=
ng employed part of the=20

water for the irrigation of his fields, he caused the rest to flow at a ven=
ture southward, following the=20

declivity of the Llanos. In this new southern direction the Rio Pao, mingle=
d with three other rivers,=20

the Tinaco, the Guanarito, and the Chilua, falls into the Portuguesa, which=
 is a branch of the=20

Apure. It is a remarkable phenomenon, that by a particular position of the =
ground, and the lowering=20

of the ridge of division to south-west, the Rio Pao separates itself from t=
he little system of interior=20

rivers to which it originally belonged, and for a century past has communic=
ated, through the=20

channel of the Apure and the Orinoco, with the ocean. What has been here ef=
fected on a small=20

scale by the hand of man, nature often performs, either by progressively el=
evating the level of the=20

soil, or by those falls of the ground occasioned by violent earthquakes. It=
 is probable, that in the=20

lapse of ages, several rivers of Soudan, and of New Holland, which are now =
lost in the sands, or in=20

inland basins, will open for themselves a course to the shores of the ocean=
. We cannot at least=20

doubt, that in both continents there are systems of interior rivers, which =
may be considered as not=20

entirely developed; and which communicate with each other, either in the ti=
me of great risings, or=20

by permanent bifurcations.  The Rio Pao has scooped itself out a bed so dee=
p and broad, that in=20

the season of rains, when the Cano Grande de Cambury inundates all the land=
 to the north-west=20

of Guigue, the waters of this Cano, and those of the lake of Valencia, flow=
 back into the Rio Pao=20

itself; so that this river, instead of adding water to the lake, tends rath=
er to carry it away. We see=20

something similar in North America, where geographers have represented on t=
heir maps an=20

imaginary chain of mountains, between the great lakes of Canada and the cou=
ntry of the Miamis.=20

At the time of floods, the waters flowing into the lakes communicate with t=
hose which run into the=20

Mississippi; and it is practicable to proceed by boats from the sources of =
the river St. Mary to the=20

Wabash, as well as from the Chicago to the Illinois. These analogous facts =
appear to me well=20



worthy of the attention of hydrographers.  The land that surrounds the lake=
 of Valencia being=20

entirely flat and even, a diminution of a few inches in the level of the wa=
ter exposes to view a vast=20

extent of ground covered with fertile mud and organic remains.* (* This I o=
bserved daily in the=20

Lake of Mexico.) In proportion as the lake retires, cultivation advances to=
wards the new shore.=20

These natural desiccations, so important to agriculture, have been consider=
able during the last ten=20

years, in which America has suffered from great droughts. Instead of markin=
g the sinuosities of the=20

present banks of the lake, I have advised the rich landholders in these cou=
ntries to fix columns of=20

granite in the basin itself, in order to observe from year to year the mean=
 height of the waters. The=20

Marquis del Toro has undertaken to put this design into execution, employin=
g the fine granite of=20

the Sierra de Mariara, and establishing limnometers, on a bottom of gneiss =
rock, so common in=20

the lake of Valencia.  It is impossible to anticipate the limits, more or l=
ess narrow, to which this=20

basin of water will one day be confined, when an equilibrium between the st=
reams flowing in and=20

the produce of evaporation and filtration, shall be completely established.=
 The idea very generally=20

spread, that the lake will soon entirely disappear, seems to me chimerical.=
 If in consequence of=20

great earthquakes, or other causes equally mysterious, ten very humid years=
 should succeed to=20

long droughts; if the mountains should again become clothed with forests, a=
nd great trees=20

overshadow the shore and the plains of Aragua, we should more probably see =
the volume of the=20

waters augment, and menace that beautiful cultivation which now trenches on=
 the basin of the=20

lake.  While some of the cultivators of the valleys of Aragua fear the tota=
l disappearance of the=20

lake, and others its return to the banks it has deserted, we hear the quest=
ion gravely discussed at=20

Caracas, whether it would not be advisable, in order to give greater extent=
 to agriculture, to=20

conduct the waters of the lake into the Llanos, by digging a canal towards =
the Rio Pao. The=20

possibility* of this enterprise cannot be denied, particularly by having re=
course to tunnels, or=20

subterranean canals. (The dividing ridge, namely, that which divides the wa=
ters between the=20

valleys of Aragua and the Llanos, lowers so much towards the west of Guigue=
, as we have already=20

observed, that there are ravines which conduct the waters of the Cano de Ca=
mbury, the Rio=20

Valencia, and the Guataparo, in the time of floods, to the Rio Pao; but it =
would be easier to open a=20

navigable canal from the lake of Valencia to the Orinoco, by the Pao, the P=
ortuguesa, and the=20

Apure, than to dig a draining canal level with the bottom of the lake. This=
 bottom, according to the=20

sounding, and my barometric measurements, is 40 toises less than 222, or 18=
2 above the surface=20

of the ocean. On the road from Guigue to the Llanos, by the table-land of L=
a Villa de Cura, I found,=20

to the south of the dividing ridge, and on its southern declivity, no point=
 of level corresponding to=20

the 182 toises, except near San Juan. The absolute height of this village i=
s 194 toises. But, I=20

repeat that, farther towards the west, in the country between the Cano de C=
ambury and the=20

sources of the Rio Pao, which I was not able to visit, the point of level o=
f the bottom of the lake is=20

much further north.) The progressive retreat of the waters has given birth =
to the beautiful and=20

luxuriant plains of Maracay, Cura, Mocundo, Guigue, and Santa Cruz del Esco=
val, planted with=20

tobacco, sugar-canes, coffee, indigo, and cacao; but how can it be doubted =
for a moment that the=20

lake alone spreads fertility over this country? If deprived of the enormous=
 mass of vapour which=20

the surface of the waters sends forth daily into the atmosphere, the valley=
s of Aragua would=20

become as dry and barren as the surrounding mountains.  The mean depth of t=
he lake is from=20

twelve to fifteen fathoms; the deepest parts are not, as is generally admit=
ted, eighty, but thirty-five=20



or forty deep. Such is the result of soundings made with the greatest care =
by Don Antonio=20

Manzano. When we reflect on the vast depths of all the lakes of Switzerland=
, which,=20

notwithstanding their position in high valleys, almost reach the level of t=
he Mediterranean, it=20

appears surprising that greater cavities are not found at the bottom of the=
 lake of Valencia, which=20

is also an Alpine lake. The deepest places are between the rocky island of =
Burro and the point of=20

Cana Fistula, and opposite the high mountains of Mariara. But in general th=
e southern part of the=20

lake is deeper than the northern: nor must we forget that, if all the shore=
s be now low, the southern=20

part of the basin is the nearest to a chain of mountains with abrupt decliv=
ities; and we know that=20

even the sea is generally deepest where the coast is elevated, rocky, or pe=
rpendicular.  The=20

temperature of the lake at the surface during my abode in the valleys of Ar=
agua, in the month of=20

February, was constantly from 23 to 23.7 degrees, consequently a little bel=
ow the mean=20

temperature of the air. This may be from the effect of evaporation, which c=
arries off caloric from=20

the air and=20

you went to-day it would be over and done with by to-morrow, and it's still=
 all to come. That's one=20

o was feeling thoroughly=20

cross. "It's easy enough to count up other people's blessings. I'm a blight=
ed blossom!"=20

"Poor little thing!            She lived all the winter            And died=

 fifty than fifteen.=20

You're too sedate. That's what's the matter with you, does not follow with =
an equal rapidity the=20

changes in the temperature of the atmosphere, and the lake receives streams=
 which rise from=20

several cold springs in the neighbouring mountains. I have to regret that, =
notwithstanding its small=20

depth, I could not determine the temperature of the water at thirty or fort=
y fathoms. I was not=20

provided with the thermometrical sounding apparatus which I had used in the=
 Alpine lakes of=20

Salzburg, and in the Caribbean Sea. The experiments of Saussure prove that,=
 on both sides of the=20

Alps, the lakes which are from one hundred and ninety to two hundred and se=
venty-four toises of=20

absolute elevation* (* This is the difference between the absolute elevatio=
ns of the lakes of=20

Geneva and Thun.) have, in the middle of=20


_
Delia and me. We know how to enjoy ourselves. There--my lecture is over and=
 now let's talk of=20

earthquakes."  "It's all very well for _you_, you've got everything you wan=
t," murmured Lorna=20

bitterly under her breath. "Some people haven't half the luck, and it's har=
d to be content with a=20

short allowance and pretend you're the same as every one else. It can't alw=
ays be done."  She=20

turned away as she said it, so Peachy only caught the sound of a grumble an=
d did not hear the=20

actual words. Had she done so she might possibly have exhibited more sympat=
hy, for she was a=20

very kind-hearted girl. Neither she nor anybody at the Villa Camellia under=
stood Lorna in the least.=20

So far their classmate had been somewhat of a chestnut-bur, and nobody in t=
he Transition had=20

ever penetrated her husk of reserve. There is generally a reason for most t=
hings in life, if we could=20

only know it, and poor Lorna's morose and hermit attitude at school was rea=
lly the result of matters=20

at home. To get into her innermost confidence we must follow her to Naples =
on her half-term=20

holiday and see for ourselves the peculiar circumstances amid which she had=
 been placed, and=20

the disadvantages that had caused her to differ from other girls.  Lorna's =
family was the smallest=20

possible, for it consisted only of her father. Nobody at the Villa Camellia=
 had ever seen Mr.=20

Carson--not even Miss Rodgers. He had communicated with her by writing when=
 he wished to=20

place his daughter at the school, but he had never paid a single visit to s=
ometimes even at one=20

hundred and fifty feet of depth, a uniform temperature from 4.3 to 6 degree=
s: but these=20

experiments have not yet been repeated in lakes situated under the torrid z=
one. The strata of cold=20

water in Switzerland are of an enormous thickness. They have been found so =
near the surface in=20

the lakes of Geneva and Bienne, that the decrement of heat in the water was=
 one centesimal=20

degree for ten or fifteen feet; that is to say, eight times more rapid than=
 in the ocean, and forty-

eight times more rapid than in the atmosphere. In the temperate zone, where=
 the heat of the=20

atmosphere sinks to the freezing point, and far lower, the bottom of a lake=
, even were it not=20

surrounded by glaciers and mountains covered with eternal snow, must contai=
n particles of water=20

which, having during winter acquired at the surface the maximum of their de=
nsity, between 3.4 and=20

4.4 degrees, have consequently fallen to the greatest depth. Other particle=
s, the temperature of=20

which is +0.5 degrees, far from placing themselves below the stratum at 4 d=
egrees, can only find=20

their hydrostatic equilibrium above that stratum. They will descend lower o=
nly when their=20

temperature is augmented 3 or 4 degrees by the contact of strata less cold.=
 If water in cooling=20

continued to condense uniformly to the freezing point, there would be found=
, in very deep lakes=20

and basins having no communication with each other (whatever the latitude o=
f the place), a=20

stratum of water, the temperature of which would be nearly equal to=20


_
remissness, but Lorna herself knew only too well that he had no intention o=
f coming. Except to the=20

office at which he was employed he never went to any place where he would b=
e likely to meet=20

English visitors. The furnished rooms where he lived were in the strictly I=
talian portion of Naples,=20

and not in the vicinity of the big hotels. Secretly Lorna dreaded her holid=
ays. There was nothing for=20

her to do while her father was at the office. She was not allowed to go out=
 alone, and unless she=20

could induce fat Signora Fiorenza, their landlady, to be philanthropic and =
chaperon her to look at=20

the shops, she was obliged to amuse herself in the house during the day as =
best she could. In the=20

the lower regions of the ambient atmosphere annually attain. Hence it is pr=
obable, that, in the=20

plains of the torrid zone, or in the valleys but little elevated, the mean =
heat of which is from 25.5 to=20

27 degrees, the temperature of the bottom of the lakes can never be below 2=
1 or 22 degrees. If in=20

the same zone the ocean contain at depths of seven or eight hundred fathoms=
, water the=20

temperature of which is at 7 degrees, that is to say, twelve or thirteen de=
grees colder than the=20

maximum of the heat* of the equinoctial atmosphere over the sea, I think it=
 must be considered as=20

a direct proof of a submarine current, carrying the waters of the pole towa=
rds the equator. (* It is=20

almost=20


_
at an Italian restaurant, and would sometimes treat her to a performance at=
 a theater or cinema=20

close at hand, or would escort her for a lamplight walk along the streets, =
but these brief=20

expeditions were evidently made out of a sense of duty, and Mr. Carson was =
plainly unhappy until=20

he was once more ensconced in his own sitting-room with his favorite the at=
mosphere lying on the=20

ocean between 10 degrees north and 10 degrees south latitude. Towards the n=
orthern limits of the=20

torrid zone, in latitude 23 degrees, whither the north winds bring with an =
extreme rapidity the cold=20

air of Canada, the thermometer falls at sea as low as 16 degrees, and even =
lower.) We will not=20

here solve the delicate problem, as=20
