being knocked about in the middle-weight boxing matches (knockings about which, to his credit it 

must be said, he bore with the patience of a martyr), yet, with all his sufferings, no single trophy as 

yet adorned Lord Spunyarn's rooms in Jermyn Street.  To-day Spunyarn had been beaten in the 

croquet tournament, and his partner had put down their united failure to the presence of Lord 

Spunyarn, while Spunyarn himself when they were beaten simply remarked, "Great mistake not 

taking the matutinal B. and S., you know." This hardly consoled the smart young lawyer, his 

lordship's partner, for his day's loss of time, his hotel bill, and his new and elaborate morning kit; 

still, he had had the honour of playing with a lord.  But metal more attractive soon compelled 

Spunyarn's attention, for his eyes fell upon the two pretty Warrender girls as they tripped towards 

the aged host, both hanging on the willing arms of the new Essex lion, Reggie Haggard.  Big 

Reginald Haggard was the ideal of the country maiden. He was not hideously beautiful, as it has 

become the fashion liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.  YOU 

AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH 

OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 

F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY

of modern romance. It may at once be said that Haggard was undeniably good-looking. His long 

black moustache gave him, in the eyes of the ladies assembled at The Warren, the necessary 

romantic air. What is very much to the point in such matters was the fact that he was also 

extremely well dressed. He had the military neatness without the military swagger, and for the first 

time in his life Haggard's well-cut clothes were paid for, to the unspeakable pleasure and 

astonishment of his tailor. For Reginald Haggard, who eight years ago had left the paternal 

mansion an expatriated black sheep, had returned a man of comparative wealth. Turned loose a 

mere boy in London, his money had been spent, as young men about town usually spend their 

money. That young but very fashionable club, the Pandemonium, receive the work electronically in 

lieu of a refund.  If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without 

further opportunities to fix the problem.  1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund 

set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES

MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.  1.F.5.  Some states do not allow 

disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. 

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to 

this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation

oyster cellar in its basement, which keeps open all night, and at which shilling cigars are _de 

rigueur_, had been the cause of most of young Haggard's embarrassments. At the Pandemonium 

Haggard had made the acquaintance of Captains Spotstroke and Pool, half-pay; that 

acquaintance had naturally proved expensive. Bets were made and paid. Haggard was introduced 

to the bill-discounting fraternity, and had even lunched with provision of this agreement shall not 

void the remaining provisions.  1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the 

Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing 

copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any 

volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
