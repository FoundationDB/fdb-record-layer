As yet there was no real sign of danger. At least, in the woods the girls had no means of 

apprehending the approach of the shroud of thick snow that was sweeping out of the northwest. 

They could not see far about them through the aisles of the wood.  Laughing and joking, the jolly 

party reached the spot of which Helen had spoken. They set to work there in good earnest to fill 

their bags with the pungent new growth of the trees, whose bending branches were easily within 

their reach.  "How this soft snow does clog the snow-shoes," complained Belle Tingley, removing 

the racquettes to knock them free.  "But the flakes are smaller now," said Ruth. "See, girls! it's 

coming faster and finer. I believe we shall have to hurry back, Helen."  "Ruth is right," added 

Madge Steele, who, as the oldest of the party, should have used her authority before this. "Why! 

it's coming in a perfect sheet."  "Sheet!" repeated Jennie Stone, with scorn. "Call it rather a 

blanket. And a thick one."  "B-r-r-r! How cold it's grown!" cried  The formidable examination which 

had excited so much interest terminated by the return of John's fly to Dunnotter, with the butler in 

it, very grave and impressive in the solemn circumstances. Rolls himself did not choose to 

consider his position lightly. He acknowledged with great respect the salutations of the gentlemen, 

who could not be prevented from crowding to the door of the fly after him. Sir James, who was the 

first, thrust something secretly into Rolls's hand. "They'll not treat you so well as they treated your 

master. You must fee them--fee them, Rolls," said the old general. "It'll be better than I deserve, 

Sir James," Rolls said. "Hoot! nothing will happen to you, man!" said Sir James. "He was well 

inspired to make a clean breast of it," Mr Monypenny said. "The truth before all--it's the best 

policy." "You're very kind to say sae, sir," said Rolls, solemnly. As he spoke he met the eye of Lord 

Rintoul, who stood behind fixing his regard upon the face of John's substitute. It was a trouble to 

Rolls to

"The wind is coming with the snow, girls," shouted Helen. "Come on! let's bustle along home. This 

place was never meant for us to be bivouacked in. Why! we'll have Long Jerry Todd, and the boys, 

and the dogs, and all hands out hunting for us. Dear me! how the wind blows!"  "I can't see, girls!" 

wailed Belle. "Wait for me! Don't be mean!"  "And don't forget Little Eva!" begged Heavy, tramping 

on could mean, "glowering" as he did, but saying nothing. Was he better aware of the facts of the 

case than any one suspected? might he come in with his story and shatter that of Rolls? This gave 

the old servant a little anxiety as he sat back solemnly in his corner, and was driven away.  It 

would be impossible to enumerate all the visitors who thronged into Miss Barbara Erskine's house 

that day. She
