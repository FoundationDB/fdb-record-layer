annual power boat race is run from Ketchikan, Alaska, to Seattle. in the flat were small, tiny they

make it any warmer, because Auntie Jan's window was wide open as it would go--top and bottom-

ideal for the college regatta and for the difficult feats of the hydroplane. During festive days many 

important events are pulled off, while the happy spectators, dressed in holiday attire, are crowded 

along the water's edge or perched on the ridges and house tops above.  For cruising, no waters in 

the world offer such advantages--never threatened by tempests and always within reach of some 

of nature's most glorious beauty spots. Landing places suitable for camps are easily found, from 

which short inland excursions may be made through alpine meadows by winding trails to the 

summit of some mountain or to the shores of some peaceful lake.  Those who are not fortunate 

enough to have their own craft are not necessarily deprived of enjoying these waters; for regular 

passenger steamers, of ample capacity and stately appearance make regular trips throughout the 

year from every city on its shores to nearly every other part of the Sound; while special summer 

time excursions are made from the metropolitan centers to all the principal points of spite of the 

screen. Ayah and little Fay were in the nursery across the passage, where there was a fire. There 

was no fire in this wind-swept chamber of Auntie Jan's.  Tony dozed and woke and woke and 

dozed, getting colder and more forlorn and miserable with each change of position. The sheets 

seemed made of ice, so slippery were they, so unkind and unyielding and unembracing.  Presently 

he saw a dim light. Auntie Jan had come to bed, carrying a candle. He heard her say good night to 

the little mem who had met them at the station, and the door was shut.  In spite of her passion for 

fresh air, Jan shivered herself as she undressed. She made a somewhat hasty toilet, said her 

prayers, peeped round the screen to see that Tony was all right, and hopped into bed, where a 

hot-water bottle put in by the thoughtful Hannah was most comforting.  Presently she heard a faint, 

attenuated sniff. Again it came, this time accompanied by the ghost of something like a groan.  Jan 

sat up in bed and listened. Immediately all was perfectly still.  She lay

Puget Sound and to the cities of British Columbia and Alaska.   HOOD CANAL.  The waters that 

put one in closest touch with the mountains are in the narrow channel, or fiord, known as Hood 

Canal, extending southwesterly and bending back into the heart of the Kitsap Peninsula. Tourists 

riding over these waters for the first time are elated with the splendors, and the frequent visitor 

never tires of the inspiring scenes that everywhere greet the eye. The eastern shores reveal the 

neat farms and settlements in Kitsap and Mason counties, while the western edge is at the very 

foot of the Olympic range, whose white serrated ridges are continually visible from the deck of a 

passing steamer. Easily distinguishable also are the deep canyons cut by the several main 

streams working their way towards the canal, plunging over rocky cliffs and creating falls of 

exquisite beauty. The Little and Big Quilcene, the Dusewallips, the Duckabush, the Hamma 

Hamma, and the Lilliwago, are some of the mountain streams whose canyons with rugged trails 

are familiar to those making frequent pilgrimages thither.  [Illustration: A BUSINESS SECTION IN

Other attractive places are Lake Cushman, a mountain summer resort reached from Hoodsport, 

and the rich Skokomish valley containing the Indian reservation of the same name. At Union City 

one may take the stage over a well traveled road through groves and vales to Shelton, county seat 

undoubtedly it was from behind the screen that it came.  Had Tony got cold?  Jan leapt out of bed, 

switched on the light and tore away the screen from around his bed.  Yes; his doleful little face 

was tear-stained.  "Tony, Tony darling, what is the matter?"  "I don't know," he sobbed. "I feel so 

funny."  Jan put her hand on his forehead--far from being hot, the little face was stone-cold. In a 

moment she had him out of bed and in her warm arms. As she took him she felt the chill of the 

stiff, unyielding small body.  "My precious boy, you're cold as charity! Why didn't you call me long 

ago? Why didn't you tell Auntie Jan?"  "I didn't ... know ... what it was," he sobbed.  In no time 

Tony was put into the big bed, the bed so warm from Auntie Jan's body, with a lovely podgy magic 

something at his feet that radiated heat. Auntie Jan slammed down the window at the bottom, and 

then more fairness! She struck a match, there was a curious sort of "plop," and a little fire started 

in the grate, an amazing little fire that grew redder and redder every minute. Auntie Jan put on a 

blue dressing-gown over the long white garment that she wore, and bustled about. Tony decided 

that he "liked to look at her" in this blue robe, with her hair in a great rope hanging down. She was 

very quick; she fetched a little saucepan and he heard talking in the passage outside, but no one 

else came in, only Auntie Jan.  Presently she gave him milk, warm and sweet, in a blue cup. He 

drank it and began to feel much

Puget Sound points--thus encircling the Kitsap Peninsula.   OTHER TRIPS.  Equally delightful are 

the little voyages over the main traveled waters of the Sound from Seattle or Tacoma to Olympia 

and Shelton, to Bremerton, Everett, Bellingham, Anacortes, Port Townsend, and Port Angeles; 

also out to the ocean or through the San Juan Islands to Victoria and Vancouver in British 

Columbia. The mountains are always in sight although not so there was no light save the red glow 

of the fairy fire, and Auntie Jan got into bed beside him.  She put her arm about him and drew him 

so that his head rested against her warm shoulder. He did not repulse her, he did not speak, but 

lay stiff and straight with his feet glued against that genial podgy something that was so infinitely 

comforting.  "You are kind," Tony said suddenly. "I believe you."  The stiff little body relaxed and
