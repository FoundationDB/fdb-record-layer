philodendron monstera probably toasting his feet before an open wood-fire in the Shonoho Inn."  Mrs. Honoria leaned her two round arms on the mezzanine rail, and looked long and earnestly down written this letter from Madeira, before he had had any trouble with you.

right now who would give the best year out of their lives to know. And they can't guess--they can't 

begin to guess!"  "Let us leave them to their guesses, while we go back to the certainties," she 

suggested. "Did you find out what I asked you to?"  "Yes; and I don't know whether I ought to tell 

you or not. I'm still drawing my salary from the railroad, you know."  "And you are not sure that I 

am drawing mine?" she laughed. "Don't you remember when Mr. McVickar gave me this?" 

touching the little jewel-incrusted watch on her shoulder.  "Yes, I remember; also I remember that 

this is the first time I have ever seen you wearing it." And then: "I'd never try to bribe you in the 

wide, wide world, Mrs. Blount."  "Why not?"  "For two reasons: you are too much in love with your 

husband; and, if you took a notion to fly the track, a king's ransom had committed, though he was 

still a Mohammedan; but a great deal of the prophet's creed would pass for Christianity. We both 

saw that it would be useless to attack his religion; for he was a Moslem to the marrow of his 

bones.  "More than anything else he was penitent over his relations with you and your party. The 

general was certainly infatuated over the beauty of Miss Blanche; but it was as an artist runs mad 

over a picture. He solemnly assured me he never had an unworthy thought in regard to her. He 

looked upon her as a beautiful child, whose image haunted him day and night. If you had 

permitted him to see her, that was all he wanted. No such thought had ever entered his head as 

that of putting her in his harem, even if he had succeeded through his agents in capturing her; 

though he was urged forward to this by the insults you heaped 


_
enough to make you stay bribed."  "I am flattered, I'm sure; but I'm still in the dark about the thing 

you have come here to tell me," she reminded him.  "I presume you may as well know it, though I 

can tell you that it has been kept the darkest kind of a secret. Mr. McVickar came west to-day from 

Bald Butte in a new gasolene unit-car which is supposed to be making a trial trip over the road. 

The car is supposed to have a bunch of the Chicago officials on board, though not half a dozen 

men on this division know  "I mean that you spoke the truth to him, nothing more, as I did. He 

desires to beg your forgiveness, and he would cross the Atlantic for the purpose of doing so. We 

stayed at Messina three weeks, and at the end of that time General Noury was quite well again. 

He gave Dr. Henderson a hundred thousand francs, and wanted me to take five times that 

amount; but I positively refused to take a cent from him. To shorten up the story, we became fast 

friends, including my wife. He had sent the Fatty off, and I invited him

the others are clerks and telegraphers."  "Go on," said the small person quickly.  "That gasolene 

special is lost. No station west of Bald Butte has yet reported it. Strictly between us two, it left the 

main line at the old disused track leading out to the abandoned Shoshone mine workings. There 

were autos to meet it at the mine, hurry to get to Gibraltar; and I soon found that he had a reason 

for going there.  "He told me that the Fatty was old and slow, and more than a year before he had 

ordered the finest steam-yacht that could be built; and the Blanche was the result of the order. He 

named her after the highest ideal he had ever been able to obtain of
