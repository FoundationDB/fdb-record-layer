dracaena marginata  They soon arrived beneath the high bank of the river upon which I stood. Poor little Jali, my plucky and active ally, lay, as I thought, dead upon the litter.

I measured the bull that was harpooned; it was fourteen feet two inches from the upper lip to the 

extremity of the tail; the head was three feet one inch from the front of the ear to the edge of the lip 

in a straight line. The harpoon was sticking in the nape of the neck, having penetrated about two 

and a half inches beneath the hide; this is about an inch and three-quarters thick upon the back of 

the neck of a bull hippopotamus. It was a magnificent specimen, with the largest tusks I have ever 

seen; the skull is now in my hall in England.  Although the hippopotamus is generally harmless, 

the solitary old bulls are sometimes extremely vicious, especially when in the water. I have 

frequently known them charge a boat, and I have myself narrowly escaped being upset in a canoe 

by the attack of one of these creatures, without the slightest provocation. The females are 

extremely shy and harmless, and they are most affectionate mothers: the only instances that I 

have known of the female attacking a man, have been those in which her calf had been stolen. To 

the Arabs they are extremely valuable, yielding, in addition to a large quantity of excellent flesh, 

about two hundred pounds of fat, and a hide that will produce about two hundred coorbatches, or 

camel whips. I have never shot these useful creatures to waste; every morsel of the flesh has 

been stored either by the natives or for our own use; and whenever we have had a good supply of 

antelope or giraffe meat, I have avoided firing a shot at the hippo. Elephant flesh is exceedingly 

strong and disagreeable, partaking highly of the peculiar smell of the animal. We had now a good 

supply of meat from the two hippopotami, which delighted our people. The old Abou Do claimed 

the bull that he had harpooned as his own private property, and he took the greatest pains in 

dividing the hide longitudinally, in strips of the width of three fingers, which he cut with great 

dexterity.  Although the hippopotamus is amphibious, he requires a large and constant supply of 

air; the lungs are of enormous size, and he invariably inflates them before diving. From five to 

eight minutes is the time that he usually remains under water; he then comes to the surface, and 

expends the air within his lungs by blowing; he again refills the lungs almost instantaneously, and 

if frightened, he sinks immediately. In places where they have become extremely shy from being 

hunted, or fired at, they seldom expose the head above the surface, but merely protrude the nose 

to breathe through the nostrils; it is then impossible to shoot them. Their food consists of aquatic 

plants, and grasses of many descriptions. Not only do they visit the margin of the river, but they 

wander at night to great distances from the water if attracted by good pasturage, and, although 

clumsy and ungainly in appearance, they clamber up steep banks and precipitous ravines with 

astonishing power and ease. In places where they are perfectly undisturbed, they not only enjoy 

themselves in the sunshine by basking half asleep upon the surface of the water, but they lie upon 

the shore beneath the shady trees, upon the river's bank; I have seen them, when disturbed by 

our sudden arrival during the march, take a leap from a bank about twenty feet perpendicular 

depth into the water good behavior.  The old man used to stay for weeks in Szeged and enjoy the 

boy's society. They were often seen walking arm in arm on the banks of the Tisza, and when they 

and Kupeczky talked Slovak together, every one turned at the sound of the strange language, 

wondering which of the many it was that had been invented at the Tower of Babel.  When the last 

lesson was over, Gregorics was waiting at the gate, and the delighted boy would run and join him--

though his comrades, who, one would have thought, would have had enough to occupy their 

thoughts elsewhere, teased him about the old man. They swore he was the devil in _propria 

persona_, that he did Gyuri Wibra's exercises for him, and that he had a talisman which caused 



him to know his lessons well. It was easy to be the first in his class at that rate. There were even 

some silly enough to declare the old gentleman had a cloven foot, if you could only manage to see 

him with his boots off. The old red umbrella, too, which he always had with him, they thought must 

be a talisman, something after the style of Aladdin's lamp. Pista Paracsanyi, the best classical 

verse writer, made up some lines on the red umbrella; which were soon learnt by most of the boys, 

and spouted on every possible occasion, in order to annoy the "head boy." But the poet had his 

reward in the form of a black eye and a bleeding nose, bestowed upon him by Gyuri Wibra, who, 

however, began to be vexed himself at the sight of the red umbrella, which made his old friend 

seem ridiculous in the eyes of his schoolfellows, and one day he broached the subject to the old 

gentleman.  "You might really buy a new umbrella, uncle."  The old gentleman smiled.  "What, you 

don't like my umbrella?"  "You only get laughed at, and the boys have even made verses about it." 

"Well, my boy, tell your schoolfellows that 'all that glitters is not gold,' as they may have heard; but 

tell them, too, that very often things that do not glitter may be gold. You will understand that later 

on when you are grown up."  He thought for a bit, idly making holes in the sand with the umbrella, 

and then added:  "When the umbrella is yours."  Gyuri made a wry face.  "Thank you, uncle, but I 

hope you don't mean to give it me on my birthday instead of the pony you promised me?"  And he 

laughed heartily, upon which the old gentleman began to laugh too, contentedly stroking his 

mustache, consisting of half a dozen hairs. There was something strange in his laugh, as though 

he had laughed _inward_ to his own soul.  "No, no, you shall have your pony. But I assure you 

that the umbrella will once belong to you, and you will find it very useful to protect you from the 

wind and clouds."  Gyuri thought this great nonsense. Such old gentlemen always attached 

themselves so to their belongings, and thought such a lot of them. Why, one of his professors had 

a penholder he had used for forty years!  One episode in connection with the umbrella remained 

fixed in Gyuri's memory ever after. One day they rowed out to the "Yellow," as they call a small 

island situated just where the Maros and the Tisza met, and where the fishermen of Szeged cook 

their far-famed "fish with paprika" (a kind of cayenne grown in Hungary, and much used in the 

national dishes). We read in Marton's famous cookery book that 


_
has created waves in the quiet pool, as though a paddle-steamer had passed by. The Arabs 

attach no value to the tusks; these are far more valuable than elephant ivory, and are used by 

dentists in Europe for the manufacture of false teeth, for which they are admirably adapted, as 

they do not change colour. Not wishing to destroy the remaining hippopotami that were still within 

the pool, I left my men and old Abou Do busily engaged in arranging the meat, and I walked 

quietly homeward.   CHAPTER XIV.  A FOREBODING OF EVIL.  I HAD been for some hours in 

the camp, but none of the aggageers had returned, neither had we received any tidings of our 

people and camels that had left us at daybreak to search for the dead elephants. Fearing that 

some mishap might have occurred in a collision with the Base, I anxiously looked out for some 

sign of the party. At about 4 P.M. I observed far up the bed of the river several men, some 

mounted, and others upon foot, while one led a camel with a curious looking load. Upon a nearer 

approach I could paprika" must only be boiled in Tisza water, and the same book says that a 

woman cannot prepare the dish properly.  Well, as I said before, the three of them rowed out to 

the "Yellow." As they were landing they struck against a sand heap, and Gregorics, who was in the 

act of rising from his seat, stumbled and lost his balance, and in trying to save himself from falling 

dropped his umbrella into the water, and the current carried it away with it.  "My umbrella, save it!" 

shouted Gregorics, who had turned as white as a sheet, and in whose eyes they read despair. The 

two boatmen smiled, and the elder one, slowly removing his pipe from his mouth, remarked 

laconically:  "No great loss that, sir; it was only fit to put in the hands of a scarecrow."  "One 

hundred florins to the one who brings it me back," groaned the old gentleman.  The boatmen, 

astonished, gazed at one another, then the younger man began to pull off his boots.  "Are you 

joking, sir, or do you mean it?"  "Here are the hundred florins," said Gregorics, taking a 


_
distinguish some large object upon the camel's back, that was steadied by two men, one of whom 

walked on either side. I had a foreboding that something was wrong, and in a few minutes I clearly 

perceived a man lying upon a make-shift litter, carried by the camel, while the Sheik Abou Do and 

Suleiman accompanied the party upon horseback; a third led his pocket-book.  The young man, a 

fine specimen of a Szeged fisherman, turned to Kupeczky.  "Is the old chap mad?" he asked in his 

lackadaisical way, while the umbrella quietly floated down the stream.  "Oh dear no," answered 

Kupeczky, who, however, was himself surprised at Gregorics's strange behavior.  "It's not worth it, 

domine spectabilis," he
