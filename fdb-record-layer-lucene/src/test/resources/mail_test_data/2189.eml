famous traveller, was perhaps the European who ventured farthest into the i=
nterior of these=20

countries. What was said of him in 1876 may now be repeated.       The dist=
rict of the Gobi=20

wilderness, and, in fact, the whole area     of Independent Tartary and Tib=
et is carefully guarded=20

against     foreign intrusion. Those who are permitted to traverse it are  =

And his learned editor adds: "This Paschai, or     Udyana, was the native c=
