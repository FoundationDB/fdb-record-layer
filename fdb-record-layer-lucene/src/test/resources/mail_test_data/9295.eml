ASSISTANCE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES.   Nearly at this time, the marshal of Fr=
ance and the=20

master of the cross-bows[59], by orders from the king of France and at his =
expense, collected=20

twelve hundred fighting men. They marched to Brest in Brittany, to embark t=
hem, for the=20

assistance of the Welsh against the English, on board of six score vessels =
with sails which were=20

lying there. As the wind was contrary, they there remained fifteen days; bu=
t when it became=20

favourable, they steered for the port of Haverfordwest,=E2=80=94which place=
 they took, slaying all the=20

inhabitants but such as had fled. They wasted the country round, and then a=
dvanced to the castle=20

of Haverford, wherein was the earl of Arundel, with many other men at arms =
and soldiers.  Having=20

burnt the town and suburbs under the castle, they marched away, destroying =
the whole country=20

with fire and sword. They came to a town called Tenby, situated eighteen mi=
les off, where they=20

found the prince of Wales[60], with ten thousand combatants, waiting for th=

University.   DETERMINATION OF AGE.  The age is a still more difficult matt=
er to state precisely.=20

Even during life one may be as much as ten years out in guessing the age of=
 an adult, while the=20

error may be from fifteen to twenty years in the case of a corpse. Dr. Tour=
des mentions a case=20

where the age was guessed as sixty and sixty-five in a deceased person aged=
 eighty-five.  The=20

state of the osseous system and the condition and number of the teeth, whic=
h strictly speaking are=20

not bone, are among the surest guides in the determination of age. The sign=
s furnished thereby=20

may vary according to the periods of increase, maturity, and decline.  Duri=
ng f=C5=93tal life and even at=20

the epoch of birth the bone centres are few. The distal end of the femur, t=
he proximal end of the=20

tibia, and the astragalus are ossified at birth. Points of ossification app=

development. The exact period at which the bones begin to ossify and=20

Thence they marched into the country of Linorquie[61], went to the Round Ta=
ble[62], which is a=20

noble abbey, and then took the road to Worcester, where they burnt the subu=
rbs and adjoining=20

country. Three leagues beyond Worcester, they met the king of England, who =
was marching a=20

large army against them.  Each party drew up in order of battle on two emin=
ences, having a valley=20

between them, and each waiting for the attack of its opponent. This contest=
, who should=20

commence the battle, lasted for eight days; and they were regularly every m=
orning drawn up in=20

battle-array, and in standard works on anatomy, it would be superfluous to =
repeat them here.=20

These changes are, however, not absolutely certain as to time and order, as=
 the tip of the=20

acromion process of the scapula sometimes remains ununited throughout life;=
 the ossification of=20

the sternum and of the costal cartilages is very uncertain, while the teeth=
, like certain railway=20

trains, are only due when they arrive.  From the character of the progress =
of consolidation of the=20

skeleton the age may be estimated with a reasonable approach to accuracy up=
 to twenty-five or=20

thirty years, which is the=20
