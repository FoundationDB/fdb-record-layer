"Oh, I'm sure if I can," said little Daisy, still in that slightly  "What I got might be called that, Clemmie. I'm sick of the hull damn round of life," he said, despondently.  "Josiah Pott!

by, for she often spent odd half-hours with the girls. "Look at everything in the same spirit, my 

love; try to see God's hand in all the little events, and you will have a brave life and a happy one." 

"And a successful, I hope," added Jasmine. "Miss Egerton, how awful it would be if we girls were 

to fail!"  "My Prince says," here interrupted Daisy, "that whenever we do a good thing and a right 

thing, we bring something fresh and lovely into our Palace Beautiful. Isn't it nice to think that dear 

old Primrose has done this?"  "The money, too, will be of great help," added Primrose. "Why, 

Jasmine, we may even be able to save a little."  Thus encouraged, Primrose commenced her time 

when you need to summon every ounce of self-control you possess. When other men are seeking 

to land the knock-out blow you should keep your head the coolest, for unless you do you cannot 

make your best calculations.' You see, I have not forgotten, and neither must you. And in 

everything, Mack," she finished, hurriedly.  The rear gate clicked, and she sent him a light trill. 

The minister went to his study as soon as he reached home. For hours he sat, his mind a blank. 

He was roused at last by the opening of his study door. He looked up into the face of his old friend. 

The blue eyes, usually clear and steady, had a faded look as though the fire in them had suddenly 

gone

ached--and she certainly found the continual reading of politics, interspersed with very sharp 

discussions on the part of Mrs. Mortlock, anything but agreeable--she did not give way.  Miss 

Egerton was pleased to see Primrose so bright, and was glad to know she was really earning 

something; and Jasmine and Daisy prepared the cheeriest welcomes possible for her evening 

after evening on her return.  Jasmine, however, by no means intended Primrose to be the only one 

who was to bring assistance to the household purse.  Jasmine knew that     CHAPTER XI   "I've 

been shut up with the most onreasonable feller I ever see in all my life," said the Captain to the 

unasked question in the minister's eyes. "I cal'late I'll keep my thoughts to myself to-night, Mack, 

and sleep on them. The way I feel wouldn't be conducive to prayer-meeting language. Good night, 

son."  It was scarcely daylight when Miss Pipkin began work in the kitchen on the following 

morning. Shortly afterward the Captain descended.  "Morning, Clemmie." He held the kitchen door 

ajar, and his voice wavered as he

educated, or to educate themselves, sufficiently to earn their livings. She considered that six 

months' experience of the ups and downs of London life might bear fruit in her case as well as in 

her sister's.  Jasmine was supposed to be having her style formed by Miss Egerton's daily tuitions, 

but Miss Egerton's words of encouragement over her pupil's productions were decidedly meagre; 

and Jasmine, though she loved her, had long ago confided to Daisy that she considered Miss 

Egerton's manner had a damping effect on enthusiasm.  One  Miss Pipkin did not reply. The 

Captain, to reinforce his courage, stepped back into the dining-room. Miss Pipkin walked over and 

closed the door. This spurred the seaman to action. He cautiously pushed the door open again, 

and peeped through a narrow crack.  "Clemmie, be you in there?"  "Where else do you think I'd 

be, down the well?"  "Can't I talk to you, Clemmie?"  "No. I don't want you to come sneaking into 

my kitchen at this hour in the morning. You ought to be in bed."  A note of friendliness in her voice 

led him to open the

scribbling away at her novel. Daisy petted the cat, looked over some well-known picture-books, 

and finally sank back into the recesses of one of the most comfortable chairs in the room and 

began to think about the Prince.  "Don't go to sleep, Daisy," called out Jasmine presently. "I'm 

coming over in a minute to consult you."  Nothing could possibly be more gratifying to Daisy than 

to know that Jasmine wished to ask her advice. She accordingly roused herself, ceased to think of 

the Prince, and said, in a very bright little voice--  "I'll help you the best I can, Jasmine."  "It's just 

this," said Jasmine, wider.  "You're up too early, Clemmie."  "I've got a lot of work to do."  "If you 

ain't too busy, I'd like awful well to speak to you about something."  "Well, I am busy, leastwise too 

busy to be bothered with your nonsense."  "It ain't foolishness this time."  Something in his tone 

made her look up into the face framed in the crack of the door.  "Josiah!" she cried at sight of the 

drawn features.  He threw open the door and entered.  "Mr. McGowan ain't sick this morning, is 

he?" she asked.  "No. Leastwise he wa'n't when I passed the time of night or early morning with 

him on my way to bed."  "Are you sick,
