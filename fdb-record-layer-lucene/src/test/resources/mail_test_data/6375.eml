ou know you are rather dull to-night?" And Lady Veriphast walked me into th=
e middle of the crowd, and abandoned me abruptly for somebody else, with _
fixed upon her. "I love flowers," she said. "I had once a little garden in =
my old home. But now I am=20

too poor to buy plants and bulbs and seedlings. How, then, shall I make a g=
arden to please Your=20

Lordship?"  "I will send you plants and bulbs and seedlings," said the Lord=
 Mayor's son, leaning=20

forward eagerly. "You must make haste, for September will soon be here, whe=
n the gardens will=20

be judged."  "Thank you, fair sir," said the girl. "I shall love my garden =
dearly, if you will help me."=20

Now when the Lord Mayor and his son had returned home, Cedric hastened to k=
eep his promise.=20

For Gerda was the fairest maid in Kisington-by-the Sea, and already he love=
d her so dearly that he=20

hoped she would win the prize and become his wife. He sent her the most bea=
utiful flowers that he=20

could find, and transplanted from his father's garden its choicest seedling=
s; he brought shrubs=20

from the city market.  The meadow between Gerda's cottage and the sea was t=
ransformed as if by=20

magic, and became a mass of rare and lovely flowers. The choicest foreign p=
lants, the gayest=20

native blooms, the shyest wild posies, all were at home in Gerda's lovely g=
arden over which the=20

sea-breeze blew. But Gerda herself was the fairest flower of them all. She =
watched and cared for=20

her garden tenderly, and like the garden she grew fairer every day, she was=
 so happy. She did not=20

know how the other gardens grew, for she did not go to see. But sometimes t=
he Lord Mayor's son=20

came, disguised as a gardener, to see how the flowers fared. And he said th=
at she had the most=20

beautiful garden in all Kisington-by-the-Sea, and he hoped that she would w=
in the prize; which was=20

very encouraging.  No one else knew about Gerda's garden. It was far from t=
own, and no one=20

dreamed that a stranger had come to live there. Besides, the neighbors were=
 so busy, each with=20

her own affairs, that they had no time to go about or ask questions, or gos=
sip; which was a good=20

thing.  No, I am wrong. One person had discovered the open secret. In a vil=
la not far from the Lord=20

Mayor's house dwelt a Countess who was very rich and proud. Until Gerda cam=
e she had boasted=20

the finest garden in Kisington, after the Lord Mayor's, made by a whole arm=
y of gardeners whom=20

she kept at her command. She was quite sure of winning the prize, and it ma=
de her very gay,=20

though she cared nothing at all about flowers. She left all the care of her=
 garden to her gardeners=20

and scarcely ever wandered down its lovely walks. But she longed to marry t=
he Lord Mayor's son=20

and live in a palace. It was the palace that she coveted as a prize, and th=
e honor of being the Lord=20

Mayor's daughter; to ride in the golden coach!  She cared no more about Ced=
ric himself than she=20

did for her lovely flowers.  One day this Countess, who had very sharp eyes=
, spied the Lord=20

Mayor's son, in his disguise, going past her villa with his arms full of cu=
rious flowers such as were=20

never before seen in Kisington-by-the-Sea. And because she had unusually sh=
arp eyes the=20

Countess knew who he was. "Aha!" she said to herself. "This is strange! Ced=
ric is meddling with=20

some garden. I must look into this!" Secretly she followed Cedric through t=
he village and out to the=20

seashore until he came to Gerda's garden. And there she saw him walking wit=
h the fair stranger=20

up and down among the flowers. The secret was discovered.  The Countess was=
 a very wicked=20

woman. When she looked over the transformed meadow and saw the beautiful ga=
rden which=20

Gerda had made, she nearly died of rage. She knew at once that against this=
 one her own garden=20

had no chance of winning the prize. She stamped her feet in jealous fury an=
d cried:--  "She shall=20

not have the palace! She shall not ride in the golden coach! She shall not =
marry the Lord Mayor's=20

son! I will see that she shall not!"  The Countess stole home with wicked w=
ishes in her heart and=20

wicked plans in her head. The next day but one was the day of the award, so=
 she had no time to=20

lose. That night when every one was asleep she crept out of her villa and a=
long the road by which=20



she had followed the Lord Mayor's son, to Gerda's garden. Everything was qu=
iet and peaceful.=20

The flowers looked very fair in the moonlight, breathing drowsy perfumes. B=
ut the wicked woman=20

cared nothing at all for them. Taking a great pair of shears from her cloak=
 she moved quickly in=20

and out among the garden beds, cutting and slashing the precious flowers an=
d trampling them=20

under foot.  When she had finished her cruel work, not a single bud lifted =
its head from the ruin.=20

The flower-beds looked as though a tempest had swept over them. Poor Gerda'=
s garden was=20

quite destroyed! The Countess chuckled as she hurried home through the nigh=
t: "We shall see=20

now who wins the prize!"  The next day Cedric thought that he would visit t=
he garden of sweet=20

Gerda in which he had taken such an interest. Dressed in his gardener's gre=
en smock he went=20

through the town, whistling happily as any yokel. But when he reached the l=
ittle cottage by the sea,=20

he ceased to whistle. Gerda was sitting upon the doorstone weeping bitterly=
.  "What is the matter,=20

Gerda?" asked Cedric anxiously, and he sought to comfort her. She could onl=
y sob:--  "Oh! My=20

dear garden! Oh! My poor flowers!"  With a sinking heart Cedric ran to the =
garden close, and there=20

he saw all the ruin that the wicked Countess had wrought.  "Alas! Who has d=
one this?" he cried.=20

But Gerda could not tell.  Cedric's heart was nearly broken. For he loved G=
erda so dearly that he=20

thought he could not live if another should win the prize. To-morrow would =
be the day that would=20

determine his fate. What could they do? Suddenly he had an idea.  "Farewell=
, Gerda!" he cried,=20

and without another word he strode away.  Then Gerda wept more bitterly tha=
n ever. She thought=20

that the Lord Mayor's son was angry with her because her garden was destroy=
ed. This was worse=20

even than the loss of her flowers.  But Cedric was far from angry with her.=
 He had gone away in=20

order to think and plan. He had one hope. He remembered that he had a frien=
d who had once=20

promised to help him in his time of trouble. The time had come.  That very =
night when the moon=20

rose over the water, Cedric went down to the sea and stood upon a rock and =
recited this charm:--=20

"Mermaid, Mermaid, rise from the sea!    I am in trouble. Hasten to me!"  H=
ardly had he spoken the=20

words when there was a little ripple in the water at his feet, and a beauti=
ful Mermaid appeared,=20

clinging to the rock over which the waves dashed prettily in the moonlight.=
 And she said:--  "Lord=20

Mayor's son, you have spoken the charm which I taught you, and I have come =
from the bottom of=20

the sea. I have not forgotten how once a cruel fisherman caught me in his n=
et, and how you had=20

pity on me and took me to the ocean and set me free. Then I promised to hel=
p you, if ever you=20

should be in trouble. What is your grief, Lord Mayor's son?"  Then Cedric t=
old her about Gerda's=20

garden and its mishap. "Ah! She must be the sweet, ragged maid who used to =
sit upon the rocks=20

and gaze down into my ocean," said the Mermaid. "She has a good heart and l=
oves the sea. Early=20

this morning I heard her weeping bitterly for her lost flowers and for you.=
 She loves you dearly,=20

Lord Mayor's son, and I love you both. What shall I do to help you?"  "Dear=
 Mermaid," said Cedric=20

eagerly, "can you find out the cruel person who has destroyed Gerda's garde=
n? And can you=20

restore the garden itself before to-morrow? I ask these two things of you."=
  "It is easy to find the=20

jealous woman," said the Mermaid. "Her you will know at the right time. But=
 the garden is another=20

matter. However, I will do my best for the two whom I love. And now, farewe=
ll!" With that word she=20

slid down the rocks, and in a little splash of spray vanished into the sea.=
  *****  Now came the day=20

when the Lord Mayor was to judge the gardens of Kisington-by-the-Sea. In al=
l the towers the bells=20

were ringing merrily, and on every side the flowers and the fair maidens we=
re blooming their=20

brightest. Through the town rode the Lord Mayor in his golden coach drawn b=
y six prancing white=20



steeds, their necks wreathed with flowers; and behind followed a great rout=
 of townsfolk, eager to=20

see the gardens judged. In the Lord Mayor's coach sat Cedric by his father'=
s side. He was dressed=20

all in white, as became a bridegroom, and in his hands he carried a huge bo=
uquet of white roses.=20

His cheeks were white, too, for he was anxious to know what this day should=
 bring, and what=20

maiden was to receive the bridal bouquet.  Through the town the merry proce=
ssion moved, and=20

stopped in turn before each garden, at the gate of which a sweet maid waite=
d, her little heart going=20

pit-a-pat beneath her prettiest gown. The Lord Mayor inspected each garden =
carefully, making=20

notes in a little white-and-gold book. And each fair maiden gazed at the ha=
ndsome Cedric and=20

hoped that the Lord Mayor was writing down her name to be his daughter-in-l=
aw!  But all the=20

gardens were so beautiful that it seemed impossible to choose between them.=
 In each the Lord=20

Mayor looked and looked, smiled and nodded,--"Very good! Very good, indeed!=
 Beautiful,=20

beautiful, beautiful! I am truly proud of the fair flowers and the fair mai=
ds of Kisington-by-the-Sea.=20

Surely, never such were seen before!"  Then he noted his little memorandum,=
 made a low bow to=20

the maiden, and mounting into the golden coach, whirled away to the next ga=
rden. At last, when=20

they had gone quite around the village, they came to the villa of the wicke=
d Countess. The crowd=20

murmured admiringly. There was no doubt about it; hers was certainly the fi=
nest garden of all.=20

When the Lord Mayor saw the gay parterres and fountains, the shady alleys a=
nd cool grottoes, the=20

wonderful flowers and shrubs growing luxuriantly everywhere, he clapped his=
 hands with pleasure=20

and said:--  "Ah! This is Paradise, indeed! Here surely we must look for ou=
r bride. Countess, I=20

congratulate you!"  The Countess was dressed in a most costly gown of white=
 satin and velvet, as=20

though she were sure beforehand that she was to be the bride. She arched he=
r neck and smiled=20

maliciously at the Lord Mayor's son, in whose eyes was no love for her.  "I=
 shall be proud, indeed,=20

to ride in your golden coach!" she said.  Cedric had grown very white, and =
he looked at the=20

Countess with disgust. She was so much less fair than Gerda, and her eyes s=
o wicked! Must he=20

marry her, after all? Yes, unless the Mermaid had wrought a miracle in Gerd=
a's ruined garden. To=20

that hope he still clung. "Father," he said earnestly, "before you judge th=
at this lady has won the=20

prize, remember that there is one more garden to visit. Have you forgotten =
the stranger maiden=20

who lives beside the sea, and how you bade her make a garden as the other m=
aids were doing?=20

Let us first go there, for she may be waiting."  "Ho, ho!" laughed the Lord=
 Mayor; "I had in truth=20

forgotten the pretty beggar. It is absurd to dream that she should have a g=
arden worth visiting after=20

The Countess laughed shrilly. "A beggar's garden!" she cried. "That must, i=
ndeed, be a wondrous=20

sight!"  "Do you come with us, my lady," said the Lord Mayor politely. "Sit=
 here by my son's side in=20

the Lord Mayor's coach. For I trow that here will soon be your rightful pla=
ce as his bride."  Now it=20

pleased the Countess to ride in the Lord Mayor's coach; and it pleased her =
more that she was to=20

see the shame of Gerda and the disappointment of Cedric when Gerda's pitifu=
l little garden should=20

be judged. So with a great rustle of satin and lace she gave her hand to th=
e Lord Mayor and=20

mounted proudly into the golden coach. But Cedric sat beside her pale and s=
ilent, little like a=20

happy bridegroom. With a snapping of whips and tooting of horns off they we=
nt, rattling through=20

the streets of the town, out over the downs toward the sea.  Behind them fo=
llowed the townsfolk in=20

a great crowd, wondering exceedingly whither the Lord Mayor was leading the=
m. For they knew of=20

no garden here. Presently, with another flourish and a cracking of whips, a=
mid the barking of dogs=20

and the shouts of little boys, the Lord Mayor's coach drew up in front of t=
he tiny cottage by the sea.=20

And the people wondered more than ever. For there was no garden anywhere to=
 be seen.  The=20

Lord Mayor alighted, chuckling as if it were all a great joke, and helped d=
own the Countess, who=20

was grinning maliciously. Last of all Cedric descended and stood waiting wh=
ile the Lord Mayor=20

with his staff knocked three times upon the door.  Presently the door opene=
d, and there stood=20

Gerda, dressed all in a gown of sea-green silk, with a string of pearls abo=
ut her neck and a pink=20

coral wreath in her hair. She was so beautiful that all the people in the c=
rowd cried "Oh!" with a=20

sound like the wind in the top of a pine tree, and the Lord Mayor himself f=
ell back a step, staring in=20

surprise. The Countess turned saffron yellow and bit her lips with envy; bu=
t still she smiled; for she=20

knew what she had done to Gerda's garden.  As for Cedric, he stood and gaze=
d as though his=20

eyes were glued to fair Gerda's face, until after a bashful silence of a mo=
ment she spoke.  "You=20

have come to see my garden," she said. "It is not like other gardens, but I=
 think it is very beautiful.=20

Will you come with me?"  She led them around the cottage to the meadow besi=
de the sea where=20

once had been the beautiful little garden which the Countess had destroyed.=
 But what was this?=20

Where were the lawns and hedges and beds of flowers? Where was the green gr=
ass? Gone! Over=20

the spot lay a sheet of rippling water, reflecting the Summer sky.  "What d=
oes this mean?" said the=20

Lord Mayor, turning sternly to Gerda. "I ask to see a garden, and you show =
me a pool of water.=20

Girl, do you jest at the Lord Mayor?"  "Nevertheless, this is my garden, si=
r," answered Gerda=20

gently, "and a fair garden I think you will find it, if you deign to look c=
losely."  "Nonsense!" said the=20

Lord Mayor crossly, and "Nonsense!" sniffed the Countess with her nose in t=
he air. But Cedric=20

stepped forward with his eyes shining, for he wanted justice done.  "Father=
," he begged, "let us go=20

nearer, as the maiden asks, and look at this which she calls her garden. Ma=
yhap we shall find=20

something new to Kisington-by-the-Sea."  For when Cedric saw how sweetly th=
e maid was=20

dressed in colors and tokens of the ocean, his heart leaped with hope that =
the Mermaid had in=20

some mysterious way redeemed her promise.  "Very well," said the Lord Mayor=
, frowning. "Let us=20

see what this foolish whim betokens. Show us your garden, girl."  Down the =
slope they went,=20

followed by the gaping crowd which cast curious looks upon Gerda as she wal=
ked by the side of=20

the Lord Mayor's son. "Tell me, what has happened, Gerda?" he asked her, sp=
eaking low so that=20

no one else might hear.  "Last night," she whispered, "I went to bed weepin=
g for my lost flowers=20

and my lost hope. But at midnight I was awakened by the roaring of the sea.=
 It grew louder and=20

louder, and at last a great wave seemed to burst over the sea-wall and come=
 foaming up even to=20



the cottage door. I was frightened sorely. But in the midst of my terror I =
heard a soft voice cry:--=20

'Fear not, gentle Gerda, and weep no more for your lost flowers. The garden=
ers of the sea have=20

come to restore your garden. And there will be a fine gown for you. Look fo=
r it upon the doorstone=20

in the morning. Farewell!' That was all.  The sea ceased its roaring, and p=
eacefully I fell asleep. In=20

the morning I found upon the doorstone this green gown. And when I looked u=
pon the plot where=20

late my poor little garden bloomed, I saw this. Behold!"  As she spoke they=
 came to the edge of=20

the pool. A chorus of wonder arose from the crowd. The Lord Mayor stood wit=
h hands raised=20

gazing down into the pool; and every one else was gazing too, with eyes of =
admiration.  The water=20

was as clear as glass, and one could see to the very bottom of the hollow w=
hich had once held=20

Gerda's unlucky garden. Now the basin was floored with polished mother-of-p=
earl, with beds and=20

borders of colored shells in lovely patterns. There were lawns of many-hued=
 ocean moss,=20

bordered by shrubs of coral, blossoming in every form and size and color,--=
spikes and clusters,=20

daisy-stars and bell shapes, all the variety of a flower-garden. Sea-anemon=
es and other living=20

plants opened and shut their tender petals. Delicate sea-ferns like maiden-=
hair and flowering=20

grasses grew upon rockeries of coral. Hedges of sea-weed, green and brown, =
yellow and pink,=20

waved their fronds gently in the water as leaves do in the air. And to and =
fro among the branches=20

of sea-trees moved glittering shapes of gold and silver, pink and pale blue=
. These were the=20

rainbow fishes,--birds and butterflies of ocean, their delicate fins moving=
 more gracefully even than=20

wings can do.  Dear little sea-horses raced up and down the coral alleys, a=
nd luminous forms=20

moved among the sea-weed, lighting the garden with living lanterns. Here an=
d there were grottoes=20

of coral and pretty arbors, and the garden was thronged with a multitude of=
 curious sea-creatures=20

even the names of which no man knows. For the gardeners of Cedric's friend =
the Mermaid had=20

scoured the ocean to find the rarest and most beautiful wonders which grow =
in a deep-sea garden,=20

such as no mortal eye ever sees.  After a time the Lord Mayor recovered bre=
ath to speak.=20

"Maiden," he said, "however you came by this wondrous ocean-garden I do not=
 care to ask. It is=20

enough that we have such a treasure in Kisington-by-the-Sea. Among all our =
lovely gardens it is=20

the fairest. Among all our curious flowers these living ones are rarest. I =
therefore judge that to you=20

belongs the prize."  Then a great cheer arose from the border of the pool w=
here the folk were=20

bending eagerly to study the wonders in the waters below. Even the maidens =
whose gardens had=20

not won the prize cheered,--all except the Countess. She ground her teeth w=
ith rage, for she saw=20

that her wicked plot had been in vain.  The Lord Mayor stepped forward and =

PICCADILLY.     PART I.  LOVE.       PICCADILLY, _2d February 1865_.  In a =
window, a few=20

doors from Cambridge House, the following placard some time since invited, =
apparently without=20

much effect, the notice of the passers-by,--"To let, this desirable family =
mansion," After a=20

considerable period the "desirable family" seem to have been given up in de=
spair, and the words=20

vanished from the scene; but the board in the window, beginning "to let" re=
mained, while the=20

"mansion" itself was converted upon it into "unfurnished chambers."  As, in=
 the words of that=20

"humble companion," whose life was rendered a burden to her by my poor dear=
 mother, "Money=20

was not so much an object as a comfortable home," I did not hesitate to ins=
tal myself in the first=20

floor, which possessed the advantage of a bay-window, with a double sash to=
 keep out the noise,=20

together with an extensive view of Green Park, and a sailor without legs pe=
rpetually drawing ships=20

upon the opposite pavement, as a foreground. My friend Lord Grandon, who is=
 an Irish peer with a=20

limited income, took the floor above, as I was desirous of securing myself =
against thumping=20

overhead; moreover, I am extremely fond of him. When I say that the positio=
n which I enjoy=20

socially, is as well adapted for seeing life as the locality I selected for=
 my residence, most of my=20

more fashionable readers will intuitively discover who I am; fortunately, I=
 have no cause to desire=20

to maintain an incognito which would be impossible, though, perhaps, I ough=
t to explain the=20

motives which induce me now to bring myself even more prominently before th=
e public than I have=20

been in the habit of doing.  Sitting in my bay-window the other evening, an=
d reading the 'History of=20

Civilisation,' by my late lamented friend Mr Buckle, it occurred to me that=
 I also would write a=20

history of civilisation--after having seen the world, instead of before doi=
ng so, as was the case with=20

that=20


_
son," he said, "and take this fair stranger to be your bride. In this spot =
where her little cottage=20

stands, I will build for you a beautiful villa."  With a happy face Cedric =
took Gerda's hand in one of=20

his, and with his other gave her the great bouquet of roses. "I obey my fat=
her's wish," he said. He=20

needed not to tell that it was his own wish, too.  Thereupon every one chee=
red again, waving caps=20

and handkerchiefs, for no one could help loving the beautiful pair and wish=
ing them happiness.=20

Only the Countess stood silent and frowning, looking ugly as a goblin.  Whe=
n the shouting had=20

ceased, Gerda stepped forward and spoke sweetly to the people. "Kind friend=
s," she said, "I am a=20

stranger to your town, yet my garden has been judged worthy of the prize. B=
ut I am sorry for the=20

fair maidens who have so long and faithfully tended their lovely flowers. T=
o me it seems that they=20

also should have a reward. In my garden grows a hedge of plants bearing pre=
cious fruit,--the pearl=20

oysters, which you see gaping with the white pearls in their mouths. I woul=
d have each maid come=20

and take one for her own."  There was great rejoicing and murmuring of than=
ks as the maidens=20

came forward one by one and bent over the pool to choose each a precious pe=
arl. The Countess=20

alone hung back. "Come hither, Countess," said the Lord Mayor, when he saw =
that all others had=20

been rewarded save her only. "Come hither and choose your pearl. You should=
, indeed, have the=20

finest, for your garden would have won the prize but for these sea-wonders =
by which it was=20

outdone."  "Choose, fair lady," said Gerda, smiling kindly. But the Countes=
s would not come. "I=20

have pearls enough of my own," she snapped. "I need no charity from a begga=
r!"  "What!" cried=20

the Lord Mayor, frowning. "Such words are not meetly addressed to my daught=
er-in-law. Nay, they=20

show an evil heart, Countess!" philosopher. Having for many years past devo=
ted myself to the=20

study of my fellow-men in all countries, I thought the time had come when I=
 could, with profit to=20

myself and the world, give it the benefit of my extended experience and my =
quick observation. No=20

sooner had I arrived at this determination, than with characteristic prompt=
itude I proceeded to put it=20

into execution; and singular though it may appear, it was not until then th=
at I found myself quite=20

incompetent to carry out the vast project I had undertaken. The reason was =
at once apparent--I=20

had seen and thought too much; and was in the position which my predecessor=
 had failed to=20

reach, of experimentally discovering that the task was beyond the human pow=
er of=20

accomplishment. Not easily vanquished, I then thought of subdividing it, an=
d dealing exclusively=20

with a single branch of civilisation. Mr Thomas Taylor Meadows, thought I, =
has written a very=20

elaborate chapter upon the progress of civilisation as regarded from a Chin=
ese point of view, why=20

should not I look upon it from a purely Piccadillean?--so I immediately loo=
ked at it. The hour 11=20

P.M.; a long string of carriages advancing under my windows to Lady Palmers=
ton's; rain pelting;=20

horses with ears pressed back, wincing under the storm; coachmen and footme=
n presenting the=20

crowns of their hats to it; streams running down their waterproofs, and cau=
sing them to glitter in=20

the gaslight; now and then the flash of a jewel inside the carriages; nothi=
ng visible of the=20

occupants but flounces surging up at the windows, as if they were made of s=
ome delicious creamy=20

substance, and were going to overflow into the street; policemen in large c=
apes, and if I may be=20

allowed the expression, "helmetically" sealed from the wet, keeping order; =
draggled women on=20

foot "moving" rapidly on. The fine ladies in their carriages moving on too-=
-but not=20


_
"Say that she shall do this, Father," cried Cedric, stepping forward eagerl=
y, for he seemed to hear=20

a secret whisper from the Mermaid prompting him; "else we shall think that =
she was the wicked=20

one who destroyed another's garden in the hope of winning the prize herself=
."  At this challenge=20

the Countess came forward sullenly to the edge of the pool. To take the nea=
rest pearl she had to=20

bend low, until her face drew close to the water. Suddenly, the watching cr=
owd saw a flash and a=20

splash and heard a shrill scream. The Countess rose, shrieking horribly. A =
huge crab had fastened=20

himself to her nose, and not easily could she be freed from this unwelcome =
ornament! At last they=20

tore away the crab, but the tip of the Countess's nose was gone, and she wo=
re a scar always,=20

even to the end of her unhappy days.  This was the Mermaid's punishment for=
 her cruel harm to=20

Gerda's garden.  But Gerda and Cedric lived happily ever after in the beaut=
iful villa which the Lord=20

Mayor built for them on the edge of their wonder-garden beside the sea. And=
 sometimes the=20

Mermaid herself came there to visit them, and to bring them some new precio=
us thing from the=20

watery world where she dwelt.    IX.  THE KING'S COAT OF ARMS  The Red King=
 could not=20

disguise his pleasure in the tale of the Wonder-Garden, though he grumbled =
when he found there=20

was to be no fighting in it. When Harold had finished reading the story, Re=
d Rex patted him on the=20

head and said gruffly,--  "Good, my boy! You do, indeed, read a tale as wel=
l as  This Piccadillean=20

view of the progress of civilisation suggested to me many serious reflectio=
ns; among others, that if=20

I intended to go to Cambridge House myself, the sooner I went to dress the =
better. Which way are=20

we moving? I mused, as I made the smallest of white bows immediately over a=
 pearl stud in my=20

neck. I gave up the "history" of civilisation. I certainly can't call it "t=
he progress" of civilisation; that=20

does all very well for Pekin, not for London. Shall I do the Gibbon busines=
s, and call it "the decline=20

and fall" of civilisation?--and I absently thrust two right-hand gloves int=
o my pocket by mistake, and=20

scrambling across the wet pavement into my brougham, drove in it the length=
 of the file and=20

arrived before I had settled this important question.  While Lady Veriphast=
, having planted me _en=20

tete-a-tete_ in a remote corner, was entertaining me with her accustomed vi=
vacity, I am conscious=20

of having gazed into those large swimming eyes with a vacant stare so utter=
ly at variance with my=20

usual animated expression, that she said at last, rather pettishly, "What _=
are_ you thinking about?"=20

"Civilisation," I said, abruptly.  "You mean Conventionalism," she replied;=
 "have you come to the=20

conclusion, as I have, that all conventionalism is vanity?"  "No; only that=
 it is 'vexation of spirit;' that=20

is the part that belongs to us--we leave the 'vanity' to the women."  "Dear=
 me, I never heard you so=20

solemn and profound before. Are you in love?"  "No," I said; "I am thinking=
 of writing a=20


_
But tell me, now; in what part of Kisington is the place where this Gerda h=
ad her Wonder-Garden?=20

Is it far from here?"  "Nay, not far from here," said Harold. "About a mile=
 from our library, by the=20

sea, stands the villa where Gerda and the Lord Mayor's son lived happily ev=
er after. I could show=20

Your Majesty the place, if you were not unfortunately at war with our city.=
"  "I would fain see that=20

place," said Red Rex thoughtfully. "I have a fancy that it."  "And the subj=
ect is the Conventionalism=20

which you call civilisation. Well, I don't wonder at your looking vacant. Y=
ou are not quite up to it,=20

Lord Frank. Why don't you write a novel?"  "My imagination is too vivid, an=
d would run away with=20

me."  "Nothing else would," she said, laughing; "but if you don't like fict=
ion, you can always fall=20

back upon fact; be the hero of your own romance, publish your diary, and ca=
ll it 'The Experiences=20

of a Product=20
