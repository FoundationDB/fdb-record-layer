companions. The latter set off toward the fringe of trees.  "Now, what did =
you chaps come here=20

for?" went on the spokesman.  "To see your big bird fly," replied Jack.  Th=
e man started.  "We=20

haven't any big bird," he said.  "Looks mighty like one, in that shed," wen=
t on Jack.  The man=20

scowled. Then he resumed.  "Weren't you warned to keep away from here befor=
e? Weren't you=20

told that your horses would be shot if you came?"  "Yes," answered Jack, sm=
iling a bit, "but you=20

see we haven't any horses with us now."  "Hu! That's a mighty poor joke," s=
neered the man.  "I=20

don't think much of it myself, but it was the best I could make under the c=
ircumstances."  Jack was=20

as cool as a cucumber, while the man was visibly losing his temper.  "Lock =
'em up!" burst out Jerry=20

Chowden. "That Ranger fellow and Nat Anderson are always making trouble."  =
"Say, when I want=20

your advice I'll ask for it," said the man curtly. Just then the individual=
 he had sent off to report=20

about the sled came back.  "It's there," he said.  "Hum!" murmured the othe=
r. Then, turning to the=20

group of men about him he said: "Better take 'em, and put 'em in one of the=
 vacant cabins for the=20

time being. Then I'll decide what to do with them."  "You haven't any right=
 to touch us, or detain=20

us!" exclaimed Jack.  "We haven't, eh? Well we're going to take the right, =
just the same. You put=20

your head in the lion's mouth, and now you are going to be lucky if he does=
n't bite it off. Lock 'em=20

up, men."  Several of the roughly-dressed men advanced toward the group of =
boys. Jack's chums=20

looked to him for advice. He had gotten them into the difficulty, and it wa=
s up to him to get them=20

out.  "See here!" exclaimed our hero boldly. "Don't you lay hands on us. We=
 are camping on this=20

mountain, and I happen to know that it's government land, and that any one =
has a right to travel all=20

around it. We have just as much right here as you have, and if you annoy us=
 I'll appeal to the law."=20

"There ain't no law out here, sonny," said one man. "You are suspicious cha=
racters, anyhow.=20

Better not make a fuss now. We're too many for you. Next time mind your own=
 affairs and you'll=20

not get into trouble."  The men had seized Nat, Bony, Sam and were advancin=
g toward Will and=20

Jack, who stood a little to one side of their chums.  One man laid hold of =
Jack, and our hero tried=20

to wrench himself free. But the man was too strong for him.  Suddenly Will =
looked across the=20

camp. He saw the man again coming from the big shed. For a moment it seemed=
 as if the lad had=20

seen a ghost, his eyes stared so. Then, with a cry he sprang forward, and r=
an toward the person=20

near the big shed.  "Catch him!" shouted the man who had directed that the =
boys be made=20

prisoners. "He's locoed--crazy!"  "Andy will look after him! He's running r=
ight into his arms," said=20

some one, and sure enough, the man did catch Will in his arms. The next mom=
ent the two=20

disappeared inside the big shed.  Jack and his chums looked at one another.=
  "He must have gone=20

suddenly out of his head," said Jack. "That blow he got when he landed in t=
he snow bank has=20

crazed him."     CHAPTER XXXIII  HELD CAPTIVES   "Now then, you chaps; are =
you going to=20

come along quietly, or will we have to use force?" demanded the man who had=
 hold of Jack.  "It=20

depends on what you're going to do with us," replied the captain of the gun=
 club.  "Well, I don't=20

know what we are going to do with you," answered the man. "It will depend o=
n what Andy says."=20

"Who's Andy?"  "That man who just captured your friend--the lad that tried =
to get away."  "Look=20

here!" burst out Nat. "If you hurt Will, or any of us, we'll have you arres=
ted. Hoptoads and hornets!=20

but you haven't any right to treat us this way."  "Say, sonny, don't use su=
ch big words, or you might=20

break an arm or leg," spoke the man sarcastically. "I've told you once that=
 you hadn't any right to=20

come here, but now that you're here, you'll have to put up with the consequ=
ences. You'll have to=20

stay here, until Andy decides what to do with you."  "Well, you'd better go=
 ask him to decide at=20

"Now just take your time," advised the man. "You're not running this."  He =
took off his cap, and=20

scratched his head in perplexity. He had a shock of thick, red hair, and fo=

since he had not announced it, the lads dubbed him Sandy.  "Was that Andy, =
as you call him, who=20

went in the big shed with Will?" asked Jack.  "That's him. He'll have to de=
cide what to do with you,=20

for I'm blessed if I know. He's the boss."  "Then go ask him," demanded Jac=
k, backing up Sam's=20

suggestion.  "I can't," was the reply.  "Why not?"  "Because Andy has given=
 orders that no one but=20

himself is allowed inside that shed, except on certain occasions."  "Is he =
afraid the big bird will get=20

away?" asked Nat.  "What big bird?" inquired Sandy quickly. He took a tight=
er grip of Jack's arm,=20

and the other men in the group, each of whom held one of the young captives=
, seemed waiting for=20

Nat's reply.  "Oh, we know you've got some kind of a monster bird in that s=
hed," went on Nat. "We=20

heard it flying over our camp, and we came out here to see it."  "Is that a=

Sandy.  "That's all," put in Jack. "We wanted to solve the mystery of the s=
trange noises, and the=20

 what he and his=20

chums had seen, relating in detail how they had tried, on several occasions=
, to penetrate to the=20

camp, and how, at length, they had made the trip on the sled.  "Now why don=
't you go tell Andy,=20

who seems to be the head of this crowd, what I say, and ask him to let us g=
o?" went on Jack. "We=20

meant no harm, but we'd like to see the bird."  "So you think it's a bird; =
eh?"  "Yes, or perhaps=20

some prehistoric monster."  Sandy laughed.  "You're right in thinking Andy =
