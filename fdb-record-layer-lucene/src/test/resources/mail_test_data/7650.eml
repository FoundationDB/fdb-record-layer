philodendron monstera shadow of Thy wings will I take refuge," which remind=
 us of the grand image in it of God's care over Israel, as of the eagle bea=
ring her eaglets on her mighty pinions (ver. 11), and point onwards to the =
still more wonderful saying in which all that was terrible and stern in the=
 older figure is softened into tenderness, and instead of the fierce affect=
ion they want to be called into action by fire. They are in a cold fluid st=
ate, and must be turned into stone. Sublime moment! when, conscious of the =
Titanic agency within them, and burning with desire to give it expression, =
men first unite to embody, and then with irresistible potency to impart to =
others that 'Life' which is 'the Light of men.'"  As I was philodendron mon=
stera shadow of Thy wings will I take refuge," which remind us of the grand=
 image in it of God's care over Israel, as of the eagle bearing her eaglets=
 on her mighty pinions (ver. 11), and point onwards to the still more wonde=

the portions of which the hymn consists. The former of these (1-5) breathes=
 prayerful trust, from=20

which it passes to describe the encompassing dangers; the second reverses t=
his order, and=20

beginning with the dangers and distress, rises to ringing gladness and triu=
mph, as though the=20

victory were already won. The psalmist's confident cleaving of soul to God =
is expressed (ver. 1) by=20

an image that may be connected with his circumstances at Engedi: "In Thee h=
as my soul taken=20

refuge." The English version is correct as regards the sense, though it obl=
iterates the beautiful=20

metaphor by its rendering "trusteth." The literal meaning of the verb is "t=
o flee to a refuge," and its=20

employment here may are not the most hopeful set after all; they believe in=
 severe muscular=20

training as necessary to produce great physical results. Get them to accept=
, the possibility of the=20

world's regeneration by a divinely-directed effort of heroic spiritual disc=
ipline on the part of its=20

inhabitants, and you might convert them from 'physical' into 'moral force' =
Christians. They=20

understand the efficacy of 'a long pull, and a strong pull, and a pull all =
together;' and they might be=20

shown that the real place for a 'biceps' is the will, not the arms; and ins=
tead of a body 'as hard as=20

nails,' the chief aim of one's life should be to bring one's spirit to that=
 condition--'hard,' be it=20

his secure retreat among the everlasting hills to the safe hiding-place whi=
ch his spirit found in God=20

his habitation. A similar analogy appears in the earliest use of the expres=
sion, which may have=20

been floating in the psalmist's memory, and which occurs in the ancient son=
g of Moses (Deut.=20

xxxii.). The scenery of the forty years' wanderings remarkably colours that=
 ode, and explains the=20

frequent recurrence in it of the name of God as "the Rock." We have false g=
ods, too, spoken of in=20

it, as, "Their rock in whom they took refuge," where the metaphor appears i=
n its completeness=20

(ver. 37). Our psalm goes on with words which contain a further allusion to=
 another part of the=20

same venerable of being impervious to the influences which weaken and demor=
alise it--hard in its=20

resistance to the tyranny of society, to the claims of family or friends, a=
nd to the force of 'natural'=20

ties, where any of these things interfere with the 'spiritual' training. It=
 is only by thus remaining in=20

the world, and yet refusing to concede a jot to it upon any pretence, howev=
er plausible, that it is=20

possible to acquire the internal isolation and strength of will necessary t=
o the achievement of=20

'these greater works.' Depend upon it, the task of performing them is not h=
opeless because it=20

seems stupendous. There are spiritual forces now latent in humanity powerfu=
