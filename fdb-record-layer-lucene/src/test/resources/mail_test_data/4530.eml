Monstrelet has been hitherto unknown, but I believe a lucky accident has en=
abled me to discover=20

him. Dom Berthod, a learned benedictine monk of the congregation of St Vann=
e, having employed=20

himself for these many years in searching the libraries and ancient rolls i=
n Flanders for facts=20

relative to our history, has made a report with extracts from numerous manu=
scripts, of which we=20

had only vague ideas. He has had the goodness to communicate some of them t=
o me, and among=20

others the chronicle of Jacques du Clercq,[11] which begins at 1448, and en=
ds, like the=20

continuator of Monstrelet, at the death of the duke of Burgundy in 1467. In=
 order to give a general=20

idea of the contents of the work, D. Berthod has copied, with the utmost ex=
actness, the table of=20

chapters composed by Jacques du Clercq himself, as he tells us in his prolo=
gue. I have compared=20

this table and the extracts with the continuation of Monstrelet, and have o=
bserved such a similarity,=20

particularly from the year 1453 to 1467, that I think it impossible for any=
 two writers to be so=20

exactly the same unless one had copied after the other.  =E2=80=98As we do =
not possess the whole of this=20

chronicle, I can but offer this as a very probable conjecture, which will b=
e corroborated, when it is=20

considered that Jacques du Clercq and the continuator of Monstrelet lived i=
n the same country.=20

The first resided in Arras; and by the minute details the second enters int=
o concerning Flanders,=20

we may judge that he was an inhabitant of that country. Some villages burnt=
, or events still less=20

interesting, and unknown beyond the places where they happened, are introdu=
ced into his history.=20

In like manner, we should discover without difficulty (if it were otherwise=
 unknown), that the editor=20

of the Grandes Chroniques was a monk of the abbey of St Denis, when he grav=
ely relates, as an=20

important event, that on such a day the scullion of the abbey was found dea=
d in his bed,=E2=80=94and that=20

a peasant of Clignancourt beat his wife until she died.  =E2=80=98To these =
divers relations between the two=20

writers, we must add the period when they wrote. We see by the preface of J=
acques du Clercq,=20

that he composed his history shortly after the death of Philip duke of Burg=
undy in 1467; and the=20

continuator of Monstrelet, when speaking of the arrest of the bastard de Ru=
bempr=C3=A9 in Holland,=20

whither he had been sent by Louis XI. says, that the bastard was a prisoner=
 at the time he was=20

writing, =E2=80=98at the end of February 1468, before Easter;=E2=80=99 that=
 is to say, that he was at work on his=20

history in the month of February 1469, according to our mode of beginning t=
he year.  =E2=80=98Whether this=20

continuation be an abridgment of the chronicle of Jacques du Clercq or an o=
riginal chronicle, it=20

seems very clear that Monstrelet has been tried by the merits of this third=
 volume, and that his=20

reputation of being a party-writer has been grounded on the false opinion t=
hat he was the author of=20

it.  =E2=80=98I cannot close this essay without expressing my surprise that=
 no one, before the publication of=20

the article respecting Monstrelet in the register of the Cordeliers, had su=
spected that part, at least,=20

of this third volume, which has been attributed to him, could not have come=
 from his hand. Any=20

attentive reader must have been struck with the passage where the continuat=
or relates the death=20

of Charles duke of Orleans, when, after recapitulating in a few words the m=
isfortunes which the=20

murder of his father had caused to France, he refers the reader for more am=
ple details to the=20

history =E2=80=98of Monstrelet:=E2=80=99 as =E2=80=98may be seen,=E2=80=99 =

NGUERRAND DE=20

MONSTRELET, BY M. DE         FONCEMAGNE, MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING PAGE,=

TRANSLATED         FROM THE XVITH VOLUME OF THE =E2=80=98MEMOIRES DE L=E2=

BELLES LETTRES,=E2=80=99 &c.   The Chronicle of Enguerrand de Monstrelet, g=
overnor of Cambray,=20

commences at the year 1400, where that of Froissart ends, and terminates at=
 1467; but different=20

editors have successively added several continuations, which bring it down =
to the year 1516.  The=20

critics have before remarked, that the first of these additions was nothing=
 more than a chronicle of=20

Louis XI. known under the name of the =E2=80=98Chronique Scandaleuse,=E2=80=
=99 and attributed to John de=20

Troyes, registrar of the h=C3=B4tel de ville of Paris. Those who have made =
this remark should have=20

added, that the beginning of the two works is different, and that they only=
 become uniform at the=20

description of the great floods of the Seine and Marne, which happened in 1=
460, for the author=20

takes up the history at that year. This event will be found at the ninth pa=
ge of the Chronique=20

Scandaleuse (in the second volume of the Brussels-edition of Comines), and =
at the third leaf of the=20

last volume of Monstrelet (second order of ciphers) edition of 1603.  The s=
econd continuation=20

includes the whole of the reign of Charles VIII. It is written by Pierre De=
srey, who styles himself in=20

the title, =E2=80=98simple orateur de Troyes en Champagne.=E2=80=99 The gre=
ater part of this addition, more=20

especially what respects the invasion of Italy, is again to be met with at =
the end of the translation=20

of Gaguin=E2=80=99s chronicle made by this same Desrey,=E2=80=94at the conc=
lusion of =E2=80=98La Chronique de=20

Bretagne,=E2=80=99 by Alain Bouchard,=E2=80=94and in the history of Charles=
 VIII. by M. Godefroi, page 190, where=20

it is called =E2=80=98a relation of the expedition of Charles VIII.=E2=80=
=99  M. de Foncemagne says nothing more of=20

the other continuations, which he had not occasion to examine with the same=
 care; but he thinks=20

they may have been taken from those which Desrey has added to his translati=
on of Gaguin, as far=20

as the year 1538. This notice may be useful to those who shall study the hi=
story of Louis XI. and of=20

Charles VIII. inasmuch as it will spare them the trouble and disgust of rea=
ding several times the=20

same things, which they could have no reason to suspect had been copied fro=
m each other.  We=20

should be under great obligations to the authors of rules for reading, if i=
n pointing out what on each=20

subject ought to be read, they would, at the same time, inform us what ough=
t not to be read. This=20

information is particularly necessary in regard to old chronicles, or what =
are called in France=20

_Recueils de Pieces_. The greater part of the chroniclers have copied each =
other, at least for the=20

years that have preceded their own writings: in like manner, an infinite nu=
mber of detached pieces=20

have been published by different editors. Thus books multiply, volumes thic=
ken, and the only result=20

to men of letters is an increase of obstacles in their progress.  The learn=
ed Benedictine, who is=20

labouring at the collection of french historians, has wisely avoided this i=
nconvenience in regard to=20

the chronicles.[13] A society of learned men announced in 1734 an alphabeti=
cal library, or a=20

general index of ancient pieces scattered in those compilations known under=
 the names of=20

Spicilegia, Analecta, Anecdota, by which would be seen at a glance in how m=
any places the same=20

piece could be found. This project, on its appearance, gave rise to a liter=
ary warfare, the only fruit=20

of which was to cool the zeal of the illustrious authors who had conceived =
it, and to prevent the=20

execution of a work which would have been of infinite utility to the republ=
ic of letters.[14]  ------------

PROLOGUE.   As Sallust says, at the commencement of his Bellum Catalinarium=
, wherein he=20

relates many extraordinary deeds of arms done by the Romans and their adver=
saries, that every=20



man ought to avoid idleness, and exercise himself in good works, to the end=
 that he may not=20

resemble beasts, who are only useful to themselves unless otherwise instruc=
ted,=E2=80=94and as there=20

cannot be any more suitable or worthy occupation than handing down to poste=
rity the grand and=20

magnanimous feats of arms, and the inestimable subtleties of war which by v=
aliant men have been=20

performed, as well those descended from noble families as others of low deg=
ree, in the most=20

Christian kingdom of France, and in many other countries of Christendom und=
er different laws, for=20

the instruction and information of those who in a just cause may be desirou=
s of honourably=20

exercising their prowess in arms; and also to celebrate the glory and renow=
n of those who by=20

strength of courage and bodily vigour have gallantly distinguished themselv=
es, as well in sudden=20

rencounters as in pitched battles, armies against armies, or in single comb=
ats, like as valiant men=20

ought to do, who, reading or hearing these accounts, should attentively con=
sider them, in order to=20

bring to remembrance the above deeds of arms and other matters worthy of re=
cord, and especially=20

particular acts of prowess that have happened within the period of this his=
tory, as well as the=20

discords, wars and quarrels that have arisen between princes and great lord=
s of the kingdom of=20

France, also between those of the adjoining countries, that have been conti=
nued for a long time,=20

specifying the causes whence these wars have had their origin.  I Enguerran=
d de Monstrelet,=20

descended from a noble family, and residing, at the time of composing this =
present book, in the=20

noble city of Cambray, a town belonging to the empire of Germany, employed =
myself in writing a=20

history in prose, although the matter required a genius superior to mine, f=
rom the great weight of=20

many of the events relative to the royal majesty of princes, and grand deed=
s of arms that will enter=20

into its composition. It requires also great subtlety of knowledge to descr=
ibe the causes of many of=20

the events, seeing that several of them have been very diversely related. I=
 have frequently=20

marvelled within myself how this could have happened, and whether the diver=
sity of these=20

accounts of the same event could have any other foundation than in party-pr=
ejudice; and perhaps=20

it may have been the case, that those who have been engaged in battles or s=
kirmishes have paid=20

so much attention to conduct themselves with honour that they have been una=
ble to notice=20

particularly what was passing in other parts of the field of battle.  Never=
theless, as I was from my=20

youth fond of hearing such histories, I took pains, according to the extent=
 of my understanding until=20

of mature age, to make every diligent inquiry as to the truth of different =
events, and questioned=20

such persons as from their rank and birth would disdain to relate a falseho=
od, and others known=20

for their love of truth in the different and opposing parties, on every poi=
nt in these chronicles from=20

the first book to the last; and particularly, I made inquiries from kings a=
t arms, heralds,=20

poursuivants, and lords resident on their estates, respecting the wars of F=
rance, who, from their=20

offices or situations, ought to be well informed of facts, and relaters of =
the truth concerning them.=20

On their informations often repeated, and throwing aside every thing I thou=
ght doubtful or false, or=20

not proved by the continuation of their accounts, and having maturely consi=
dered their relations, at=20

the end of a year I had them fairly written down, and not sooner. I then de=
termined to pursue my=20

work to a conclusion, without leaning or showing favour to any party, but s=
imply to give to every=20

one his due share of honour, according to the best of my abilities; for to =
do otherwise would be to=20

detract from the honour and prowess which valiant and prudent men have acqu=
ired at the risk of=20

their lives, whose glory and renown should be exalted in recompense for the=
ir noble deeds.  And=20

inasmuch as this is a difficult undertaking, and cannot be pleasing to all =
parties,=E2=80=94some of whom=20



may maintain, that what I have related of particular events is not the trut=
h,=E2=80=94I therefore entreat and=20

request all noble persons who may read this book to excuse me, if they find=
 in it some things that=20

may not be perfectly agreeable to them; for I declare I have written nothin=
g but what has been=20

asserted to me as fact, and told to me as such, and, should it not prove so=
, on those who have=20

been my informants must the blame be laid. If, on the contrary, they find a=
ny virtuous actions=20

worthy of preservation, and that may with delight be proposed as proper exa=
mples to be followed,=20

let the honour and praise be bestowed on those who performed them, and not =
on me, who am=20

simply the narrator.  This present Chronicle will commence on Easter-day, i=
n the year of Grace=20

1400, at which time was concluded the last volume of the Chronicles of sir =
John Froissart, native=20

of Valenciennes in Hainault, whose renown on account of his excellent work =
will be of long=20

duration. The first book of this work concludes with the death of Charles V=
I. the most Christian and=20

most worthy king of France, surnamed =E2=80=98the well beloved,=E2=80=99 wh=
o deceased at his h=C3=B4tel of St Pol at=20

Paris, near the Celestins, the 22d day of October 1422. But that the causes=
 of these divisions and=20

discords which arose in that most renowned and excellent kingdom of France =
may be known,=20

discords which caused such desolation and misery to that realm as is pitifu=
l to relate, I shall touch=20

a little at the commencement of my history on the state, government, manner=
s and conduct of the=20

CHRONICLES                                     OF                        _E=

CHAP. I.      HOW CHARLES THE WELL-BELOVED REIGNED IN FRANCE, AFTER HE HAD=
=20

BEEN CROWNED AT RHEIMS, IN THE YEAR THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND         EIGHTY.   =
In=20

conformity to what I said in my prologue, that I would speak of the state a=
nd government of king=20

Charles VI. of France, surnamed the well-beloved, in order to explain the c=
auses of the divisions=20

and quarrels of the princes of the blood royal during his reign and afterwa=
rd, I shall devote this first=20

chapter to that purpose.  True it is, that the above-mentioned king Charles=
 the well-beloved, son to=20

king Charles V. began to reign and was crowned at Rheims the Sunday before =
All-saints-day, in=20

the year of Grace one thousand three hundred and eighty, as is fully descri=
bed in the Chronicles of=20

sir John Froissart. He was then but fourteen years old, and thenceforward f=
or some time governed=20

his kingdom right well. By following prudent advice at the commencement of =
his reign, he=20

undertook several expeditions, in which, considering his youth, he conducte=
d himself soberly and=20

valiantly, as well in Flanders, where he gained the battle of Rosebeque and=
 reduced the Flemings=20

to his obedience, as afterward in the valley of Cassel and on that frontier=
 against the duke of=20

Gueldres. He then made preparations at Sluys for an invasion of England. Al=
l which enterprises=20

made him redoubted in every part of the world that heard of him.  But Fortu=
ne, who frequently=20

turns her wheel against those of high rank as well as against those of low =
degree, began to play=20

him her tricks[15]; for, in the year one thousand three hundred and ninety-=
two, the king had=20

resolved in his council to march a powerful army to the town of Mans, and t=
hence invade Brittany,=20

to subjugate and bring under his obedience the duke of Brittany, for having=
 received and=20

supported the lord Peter de Craon, who had beaten and insulted in Paris, to=
 his great displeasure,=20

sir Oliver de Clisson, his constable.  On this march, a most melancholy adv=
enture befel him, which=20

brought on his kingdom the utmost distress, and which I shall relate, altho=
ugh it took place prior to=20

the date of this history.  During the time the king was on his march from M=
ans toward Brittany,=20



attended by his princes and chivalry, he was suddenly seized with a disorde=
r which deprived him=20

of his reason. He wrested a spear from the hands of one of his attendants, =
and struck with it the=20

varlet of the bastard of Langres, and slew him: he then killed the bastard =
of Langres, and struck=20

the duke of Orleans, his brother, who, although well armed, was wounded in =
the shoulder. He next=20

wounded the lord de Saint Py, and would have put him to death had not God p=
revented it; for in=20

making his thrust, he fell to the ground,=E2=80=94when, by the diligence of=
 the lord de Coucy and others=20

his faithful servants, the spear was with difficulty taken from him. Thence=
 he was conducted to the=20

said town of Mans, and visited by his physicians, who thought his case hope=
less: nevertheless, by=20

the grace of God, he recovered better health, and his senses, but not so so=
undly as he possessed=20

them before this accident. From that time he had frequent relapses,=E2=80=
=94and it was necessary, during=20

his life, perpetually to look after him and keep him under strict observanc=
e.  From this unfortunate=20

disorder may be dated all the miseries and desolations that befel his realm=
; for then begun all=20

those jealousies between the princes of his blood, each contending for the =
government of the=20

kingdom, seeing clearly that he was willing to act in any manner that those=
 near his person=20

desired, and in the absence of their rivals craftily advising him to their =
own private advantage,=20

without attending to act in concert for the general good of the state. Some=
, however, acquitted=20

themselves loyally, for which after their deaths, they were greatly praised=
.  This king had several=20

sons and daughters, whose names now follow, that lived to man=E2=80=99s est=
ate; first, Louis, duke of=20

Acquitaine, who espoused the eldest daughter of the duke of Burgundy, but d=
ied without issue=20

before the king his father,=E2=80=94John, duke of Touraine, who married the=
 only daughter of duke=20

William of Bavaria, count of Hainault, who also died before his father, and=
 without issue,=E2=80=94Charles,=20

married to the daughter of king Louis II. of Naples, who had issue that wil=
l be noticed hereafter: he=20

succeeded to the crown of France on the death of his father.  He had five d=
aughters: Isabella, the=20

eldest, was first married to king Richard II. of England, and afterward to =
Charles duke of Orleans,=20

by whom she had a daughter: Jane, married to John duke of Brittany, had man=
y children: Michelle=20

espoused Philip duke of Burgundy, but had no issue: Mary was a nun at Poiss=
y: Catherine,=20

married to Henry V. of England, had a son, Henry, who succeeded, on the dea=
th of his father, to=20

the throne of England. King Charles had all these children by his queen, Is=
abella[16], daughter to=20

Stephen duke of Bavaria.                                    CHAP. II.      =

fore or hinder parts of the body, from the fork of the body upward.  =E2=80=
=98These courses being finished,=20

the following combats to take place: that is to say, should it happen that =
neither of us be wounded,=20

we shall be bound to perform, on that or on the following day, so many cour=

ch person being armed=20

as to his body and head according to his pleasure. The targets to be made o=

 to be performed with=20

the before-mentioned lances and saddles, on horseback; but each may settle =
his stirrups as he=20

pleases, but without any trick.  =E2=80=98To add greater authenticity to th=
is letter, I Michel d=E2=80=99Orris have=20

sealed it with the seal of my arms, written and dated from Paris, Friday th=
e 27th day of May, in the=20

year 1400.=E2=80=99  The poursuivant Aly went with this letter to Calais, w=
here it was seen by an english=20

knight, called sir John Prendergast, who accepted the challenge, provided i=
t were agreeable to his=20

sovereign lord the king of England, and in consequence wrote the following =
answer to the=20

arragonian esquire:  =E2=80=98To the noble and honourable personage Michel =
d=E2=80=99Orris,=E2=80=94John Prendergast,=20

knight, and familiar to the most high and puissant lord the earl of Somerse=
t, sends greeting,=20

honour and pleasure.  =E2=80=98May it please you to know, that I have just =
seen your letter, sent hither by=20

the poursuivant Aly, from which I learn the valiant desire you have for dee=
ds of arms, which has=20

induced you to wear on your leg a certain thing that is of pain to you, but=
 which you will not take off=20

until delivered by an english knight performing with you such deeds of arms=
 as are mentioned in=20

your aforesaid letter. I, being equally desirous of gaining honour and amus=
ement like a gentleman=20

to the utmost of my power, in the name of God, of the blessed virgin Mary, =
of my lords St George=20

and St Anthony, have accepted and do accept your challenge, according to th=
e best sense of the=20

terms in your letter, as well to ease you from the pain you are now sufferi=
ng as from the desire I=20

have long had of making acquaintance with some of the french nobility, to l=
earn more knowledge=20

from them in the honourable profession of arms. But my acceptation of your =
challenge must be=20

subject to the good pleasure of my sovereign lord the king, that he may fro=
m his especial grace=20

grant me liberty to fulfil it, either before his royal presence in England,=
 or otherwise at Calais=20

before my lord the earl of Somerset.  =E2=80=98And since you mention in you=
r letter, that you will provide=20

helmets, from which your adversary may chuse, and that each may wear such g=
orgets as he shall=20

please, I wish you to know, that to prevent any unnecessary delay by any su=
pposed subtlety of=20

mine respecting armour or otherwise, I will also bring with me two helmets =
and two gorgets for=20

you, if you shall think proper, to chuse from them; and I promise you, on m=
y loyalty and good faith,=20

that I will exert all my own influence and that of my friends, to obtain th=
e aforesaid permission, of=20

which I hope to God I shall not be disappointed.  =E2=80=98Should it be the=
 good pleasure of the king to=20

grant his consent, I will write to the governor of Boulogne on Epiphany-day=
 next ensuing, or=20

sooner if it be possible, to acquaint him of the time and place of combat, =
that you may be instantly=20

informed of the willingness of my heart to comply with your request.  =E2=
=80=98Noble, in the presence of a=20

person, does not apply to silence at a judicial proceeding or hearing, and =
since the proceedings at=20



a coroner=E2=80=99s inquest are of a judicial character, what there transpi=
red must be considered as a part=20

of the proceedings.[560] The leading cases which have been before the New Y=
ork Court of=20

Appeals upon this important question, and from which that court has finally=
 deduced that rule, may=20

be here referred to.   _Hendrickson Case._=E2=80=94In the first case the wi=
fe of the defendant  died=20

suddenly in the morning, and in the evening of the same day a  coroner=E2=
=80=99s inquest was held. The=20

defendant was called and sworn as a  witness upon the inquest. At that time=
 it did not appear that=20

any  crime had been committed, or that the defendant had been charged with =
 any crime, or even=20

suspected, except so far as the nature of some of  the questions asked of h=
im might indicate such=20

a suspicion. On his  subsequent trial on an indictment for the murder of hi=
s wife, the  statements=20

made by him at the coroner=E2=80=99s inquest were held admissible,  on the =
ground that he was not=20

examined as a party charged with the  crime, that it had not appeared even =
that a crime had been=20

committed,  and that he had simply testified as a witness on the inquiry as=
 to the  cause of the=20

death.[561]   _McMahon Case._=E2=80=94Following this came the _McMahon Case=
_, in which  it=20

appeared that the defendant was arrested by a constable, without  warrant, =
on a charge of having=20

murdered his wife. The constable took  him before the coroner, who was hold=
ing an inquest on the=20

body, by  whom he was sworn and examined as a witness. It was held that the=
  evidence thus=20

given was not admissible on the prisoner=E2=80=99s trial for the  murder, a=
nd his conviction was reversed=20

upon that ground.[562]   _Teachout Case._=E2=80=94The doctrine of this case=
 was more clearly defined=20

and somewhat limited in a later case, the _Teachout Case_. In that  case th=
e defendant appeared=20

at the coroner=E2=80=99s inquest in pursuance of  a sub-p=C5=93na to testif=
y, and voluntarily attended; he was=20

not under  arrest, but was informed by some one that it was charged that hi=
s wife  had been=20

poisoned and that he would be arrested for the crime. Before  he was sworn =
he was informed by=20

the coroner that there were rumors  that his wife came to her death by foul=
 means and that some=20

of those  rumors implicated him, and that he was not obliged to testify unl=
ess  he chose. He said=20

he had no objection to telling all he knew. The  Court in delivering its op=
inion preludes it by a=20

reference to these  facts as showing that the statements made were voluntar=
y in every  legal=20

sense, and held that a mere consciousness of being suspected  of a crime di=
d not so disqualify=20

him that his testimony, in other  respects freely and voluntarily given bef=
ore the coroner, could not=20

be used against him on his trial on a charge subsequently made of  such cri=
me. On that ground it=20

held the evidence properly admitted,  at the same time referring with appro=
val to the _McMahon=20

Case_,  and distinctly limiting the rule of exclusion to cases within its  =
bounds.[563]   _Mondon=20

Case._=E2=80=94Then followed the _Mondon Case_, where on the  finding of th=
e body of the deceased,=20

the defendant was arrested  without warrant as the suspected murderer. Whil=
e he was thus in=20

custody the coroner empanelled a jury and held an inquest, and the  defenda=
nt was called as a=20

witness before the inquest and was examined  by the district attorney and b=
y the coroner. The=20

prisoner was an  ignorant Italian laborer unfamiliar with the English langu=
age. He  was unattended=20

by counsel, and it did not appear that he was in any  manner informed of hi=
s rights, or that he was=20

not bound to answer  questions tending to criminate him He was twice examin=
ed; on the first=20

occasion the examination was taken by questions put either by the  district=
 attorney or by the=20

coroner, and the result written down by  the coroner, who then read the evi=
dence over to him, line=20

by line, and  asked him if he understood it and if it was the truth, and he=
 said it  was, and the=20

coroner then reswore him to the deposition. The coroner,  after taking the =
defendant=E2=80=99s testimony=20



on the first day, came to the  conclusion that the defendant did not unders=
tand English well=20

enough  to be examined, and that it ought to be taken through an interprete=
r,  which was done, in=20

order that they might get it a little better and  a little fuller. It was h=
eld that the defendant=E2=80=99s=20

testimony was not  admissible upon his trial on the indictment.[564] It wil=
l be seen that  this latter=20

case follows in direct line with the rule announced in the  _McMahon Case_ =
and clearly=20

distinguishes another case, the _McGloin  Case_, upon the authority of whic=
h the trial court held=20

the testimony  of the prisoner in the _Mondon Case_ admissible.   _McGloin =
Case._=E2=80=94The case of=20

_McGloin_ was not that of the examination  of a prisoner on oath before a m=
agistrate before whom=20

he was taken  involuntarily, while in custody, and interrogated by the magi=
strate,  who to all=20

appearance had power to require him to answer, but while  under arrest the =
prisoner said to the=20

inspector of police who had him  in charge that he would make a statement. =
The inspector then=20

said  that he would send for a coroner to take it. The coroner was then  se=
nt for and came to police=20

headquarters and took down in writing the  confession dictated by the priso=
ner, the coroner asking=20

no questions  and not acting in any official capacity, but as a mere amanue=
nsis to  take down the=20

confession and prove the contents. It was held that the  confession of the =
prisoner was admissible=20

in evidence upon his trial  for murder.[565]  _Rule in Pennsylvania._=E2=80=
=94The rule in Pennsylvania is=20

substantially that when the testimony given by the prisoner under oath befo=
re a coroner=E2=80=99s inquest,=20

previous to him being charged or suspected of the murder of the individual =
upon whose body the=20

inquest was sitting, may afterward be given in evidence against him, on his=
 trial for the murder of=20

such person.[566]  _Rule in Nebraska._=E2=80=94The statements of a prisoner=
 to be competent evidence=20

must have been voluntarily made. In cases of declaration made on an examina=
tion before a=20

coroner=E2=80=99s inquest by a person under arrest or charged with the crim=
e and also under oath, they are=20

not admissible. But when the person, although he be subsequently charged wi=
th the offence,=20

appears voluntarily, and gives testimony, before any accusation has been ma=
de against him, his=20

statements are admissible in evidence against him on the trial of an indict=
ment for the crime.[567]=20

MEDICO-LEGAL AUTOPSIES.  BY  H. P. LOOMIS, A.M., M.D.,  _Professor of Patho=
logy in the=20

University of the City of New York; Visiting Physician and Curator to Belle=
vue Hospital, New York;=20

Pathologist to the Board of Health, New York City; President New York Patho=
logical Society, etc.,=20

etc._     AUTOPSIES.   A MEDICAL examiner before proceeding with an autopsy=
, especially if=20

called before the body has been removed from the place where it was found, =
should carefully note=20

certain facts. These should be entered by himself or an assistant with grea=
t care, in a note-book,=20

as this book can be introduced as evidence in any trial. A satisfactory way=
 is to dictate to the=20

assistant as the examination proceeds, and at the conclusion the assistant =
reads the notes taken,=20

and the examiner verifies them.   SURROUNDING OBJECTS=E2=80=94POSITION OF T=
HE BODY.=20

These should be first noted. The character of the soil; the condition of th=
e ground, and whether it=20

shows footprints; if so, their direction; the evidence of any struggle; the=
 presence of any weapon;=20

and finally, the exact position in which the body lies, especially the posi=
tion of the hands and feet.=20

This is important, for the body may be found in a position which the deceas=
ed could not have=20

assumed on the supposition of the wound or injury having been accidental or=
 homicidal. If possible=20

a photograph should be taken of the body in the exact position in which it =
is found. If it is=20

absolutely necessary to remove the body, it should be done with great care,=
 keeping the body in=20

as horizontal a position as possible.  The character of the surrounding soi=
l should be noted. This is=20



of special importance when the body to be examined has been exhumed: for th=
e question of=20

preservation of the body and the ability to recognize pathological changes =
may be brought up at a=20

trial. This was an important point raised in the Buchanan case (New York, 1=
893).  If a body be=20

found in the water, examine the character of the water and the temperature,=
 and if found near the=20

shore, the character of shore and bottom.  =3DBlood.=3D=E2=80=94The situati=
on of blood-stains, and their=20

number and extent, on clothing or surrounding objects should be noted. This=
 will often show=20

whether a struggle has taken place after receiving the fatal wound, and is =
also of medico-legal=20

importance if made at the time the body is found, for it may be so situated=
 as to show that the=20

body has been interfered with after death.  Again, spots of blood found upo=
n articles of clothing or=20

upon surrounding objects should be noted as to their form and direction, fo=
r they may serve to=20

furnish an indication of the position of the person with respect to them wh=
en the wound was=20

inflicted. For example, if the spot was oval, the presumption is that the p=
erson was placed=20

obliquely with respect to the stain while the hemorrhage was occurring. The=
 force with which the=20

blood was thrown out will in some measure be indicated by the obliquity or =
length of the spot. The=20

amount of blood will also often indicate whether the person has died sudden=
ly, the exact spot=20

where death occurred, whether a struggle took place, and will also preclude=
 the possibility of a=20

person moving after receiving the fatal injury. When we examine a body, esp=
ecially when found in=20

a room, care must be taken not to be misled by the accidental diffusion of =
blood by persons going=20

in and out, or touching the body (see BLOOD-STAINS, Vol. II.)  =3DClothing.=
=3D=E2=80=94The examination of=20

the clothing should be thorough. A description of each article should be no=
ted, and the order in=20

which it is removed; for often it is important to prove that the garments w=
ere worn by or belonged=20

to the deceased. If any blood is on the clothing, note whether the blood is=
 in large patches, or=20

whether it is sprinkled over the garment: the amount of the blood and what =
garments are stained=20

by it. Note and examine whether the blood has flowed down the front of the =
clothing, whether it=20

has soaked the inner garments, or again, whether it has collected along the=
 back; for these=20

appearances will sometimes demonstrate whether a wound was inflicted while =
the person was=20

sitting, standing, or lying down. For example, if the throat is cut while t=
he person is lying down, the=20

blood will be found on each side of the neck along the back and not down th=
e front of the body.=20

Few suicides cut their throats in a recumbent position, and this distributi=
on of the blood may serve=20

to distinguish a suicidal from a homicidal wound.  The condition of the clo=
thing may also serve to=20

show whether there has been any struggle, and the presence of dry spots or =
mud on it may=20

sometimes serve to connect an accused person with an act of murder. This is=
 well illustrated in the=20

case of Reg. _v._ Snipe, reported in Beck=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CMedical Jurisp=
rudence,=E2=80=9D where evidence was=20

adduced to show that some spots of mud on the boots and clothing of the pri=
soner, when=20

examined microscopically, contained infusoria, shells, and some rare aquati=
c vegetables. The mud=20

of the ditch close to where the body was found, as also the mud on the clot=
hing of the dead body,=20

presented the same microscopical appearances. The medical expert who gave t=
his evidence=20

swore that in his opinion the mud spots on the body and on the prisoner=E2=
=80=99s boots were derived from=20

the same ditch, for the mud of all the other ditches in the locality was fo=
und, on microscopical=20

examination, to be different. The well-known case which occurred in New Yor=
k a few years ago,=20

known as the =E2=80=9CShakespeare case,=E2=80=9D furnishes an example of th=
e importance of carefully examining=20

all stains on the clothing found on bodies.  If there are several stabs or =
cuts on the body involving=20



the dress, it should be noted whether they are blood-stained, and if so, wh=
ether the stain is on the=20

inside or outside of the garments, for sometimes in simulated personal inju=
ry a stain of blood may=20

be inadvertently applied to the outside of the dress, as in wiping a weapon=
.  =3DWeapons.=3D=E2=80=94If a=20

weapon is found, the character of the weapon and its exact position should =
be noted. This is=20

frequently of importance in telling whether a person has died from an accid=
ental or self-inflicted=20

wound. In a case where death occurs immediately or within a few minutes, th=
e weapon is found=20

near the body, or often so tightly grasped in the hand that it can be with =
difficulty removed. If the=20

weapon is found near the body it should be noted on which side and at what =
distance, and it must=20

be questioned whether it could have fallen on the spot or been thrown there=
 by the deceased. It is=20

compatible with suicide that the weapon should be found at some distance fr=
om the body. An=20

instance has been recorded where an individual was discovered in bed with h=
is throat cut, and the=20

bloody razor was found closed and in the pocket of the deceased. If a weapo=
n cannot be=20

discovered, or is concealed, it is strong presumptive evidence of homicide;=
 especially when the=20

wound is such as to produce speedy death.  Note whether the weapon is sharp=
 or blunt, straight or=20

curved. If a knife, the handle and inner portion should be examined, for th=
e blade may have been=20

washed.  If the wound has involved any large vessels, it is improbable that=
 the weapon can have=20

been thrown any distance from the body, and when it is, there are always fa=
ir grounds to expect=20

interference with the original position of the body. One circumstance which=
 always strongly points=20

to suicide is the finding of the weapon firmly grasped in the hand of the c=
adaver. The hand of a=20

dead person cannot be made to grasp or retain a weapon as does the hand whi=
ch has grasped it=20

at the last moments of life. The amount of blood on the weapon should be no=
ted, but it must be=20

remembered that a knife may have produced a fatal stab wound and still no b=
lood be found on it.=20

This is explained by the fact that in a rapid plunge the vessels were compr=
essed, and only after=20

the drawing of the knife and relieving of the pressure blood began to flow,=
 or possibly the blood=20

may have been wiped off the knife by the elasticity of the skin.  When a pe=
rson has died of a=20

gunshot wound, especially at close range, it is important to look for any w=
adding or paper found in=20

the wound, as in a number of instances the finding of such has led to the d=
etection of the criminal.=20

For example, handwriting has been found on the paper, or it has formed part=
 of a printed page the=20

rest of which has been found in possession of the accused. When a gun is di=
scharged near the=20

body, a portion of the wadding is almost always found in the irregular woun=
d produced.   POST-

MORTEM EXAMINATION.  Having completed the examination of the surroundings, =
one next=20

proceeds with the post-mortem examination, which should be conducted accord=
ing to a well-

defined plan, following which the results obtained will always be satisfact=
ory.  If possible the body=20

should be removed to a large, well-ventilated, and especially well-lighted =
room. No artificial light, if=20

it can possibly be avoided, should be used when performing the autopsy; art=
ificial light is=20

especially bad on account of its yellowness and its power to modify natural=
 color. Many diseased=20

conditions cannot be satisfactorily determined by artificial light. The bod=
y should be placed on a=20

high table, and the facility with which the autopsy is made will often depe=
nd on having the table=20

high enough to render stooping unnecessary. Never make an autopsy, if it ca=
n possibly be=20

avoided, on a body while in a coffin, as the examination is always unsatisf=
actory. The size and=20

surroundings of the room, and how it is lighted, should be entered in the n=
ote-book.=20

=3DInstruments.=3D=E2=80=94If possible the following instruments should be =
at hand before proceeding with an=20



examination, although some of them may be dispensed with:  (1) Large sectio=
n knife; (2) scalpels;=20

(3) enterotome (for opening intestines and stomach); (4) costotome, or larg=
e bone forceps (for=20

cutting ribs); (5) scissors, large and small (one blade blunt); (6) saw; (7=
) chisel; (8) dissecting=20

forceps; (9) probe; (10) blowpipe; (11) curved needles and strong twine; (1=
2) measuring and=20

graduated glass; (13) small scales.  Besides the above instruments, some ba=
sins containing=20

water; sponges, bottle of flexible collodion, Lugol=E2=80=99s solution of i=
odine for the amyloid test, will be=20

needed.  =3DPost-Mortem Wounds.=3D=E2=80=94Various plans have been proposed=
 to protect the operator=E2=80=99s=20

hands from the post-mortem wounds which are often so dangerous, such as wea=
ring rubber=20

gloves, smearing the hands with carbolized vaselin, both of which have thei=
r disadvantages: the=20

gloves being too clumsy, and the vaselin rendering it almost impossible to =
hold the knife steady.=20

Gloves should always be worn, however, where the body has undergone much de=
composition, or=20

where the person may have died from any septic disease. A method which I ha=
ve found=20

satisfactory is to cover all cuts and hangnails with flexible collodion, an=
d then to have a basin of=20

clean water at hand, and from time to time to rinse one=E2=80=99s hands in =
the water. It is from bathing the=20

hands in the cadaveric fluids and not from cuts that most of the danger com=
es. If possible an=20

absolutely new board, large enough upon which to examine the organs, should=
 be at hand, for it=20

may be claimed at a trial that the organs and tissues, if placed and examin=
ed on surrounding=20

objects, have become contaminated.  =3DToxicological.=3D=E2=80=94If a chemi=
cal analysis of the various=20

organs and tissues is to be made, and it is impossible to have the chemist =
present, the medical=20

examiner should obtain some new glass jars of suitable size, with close-fit=
ting glass covers. These=20

jars should be rinsed with distilled water, and in them the various organs =
are to be placed; if=20

possible with no preserving fluid on them. But if it is found impossible to=
 deliver the jars to the=20

chemist at once, alcohol may be poured over the organs in the jars, but it =
is specially important=20

that a sample of this alcohol should be retained, that a chemist may at a f=
uture date test the same=20

for any impurities. After the organs and tissues have been placed in the ja=
rs, the mouths should be=20

closed and sealed, and the seal remain in the custody of the examiner until=
 the jars are delivered=20

to the chemist.  =3DParts to be Preserved for the Chemist.=3D=E2=80=94In ca=
ses of suspected poisoning, it is=20

not sufficient that the stomach and intestines alone should be preserved fo=
r the chemist as has=20

been indicated, each part by itself; for it should be remembered that the p=
ortion of poison=20

remaining in the alimentary tract is but the residue of the dose which had =
been sufficient to destroy=20

life, and if the processes of elimination have been rapid no trace of the p=
oison will be found in the=20

alimentary canal but can readily be detected in other organs. Again, the po=
ison may not have been=20

introduced by the mouth, in which case none may be found in the digestive t=
ract.  The chemist=20

should receive, besides the stomach and entire intestinal canal, the liver,=
 one or both kidneys, the=20

spleen, a piece of muscle from the leg, the brain, and any urine found in t=
he bladder.  When it is=20

impossible for any reason to obtain the whole of any organ, the part remove=
d should be carefully=20

weighed and its proportion to the rest of the organ noted.  It is also of e=
xtreme importance to=20

preserve in sealed and labelled jars those parts of a body which may show t=
he evidence of=20

disease, or on the appearance of which one=E2=80=99s evidence is founded.  =
 ORDER OF AUTOPSY.  In=20

making the autopsy, the operator should stand on the right side of the body=
 and make the incision=20

by grasping the knife firmly in the hand, and cutting with the whole of the=
 blade and not with the=20

point. The knife should be swept along from the shoulder rather than from t=
he wrist, thus making a=20



long, smooth, deep cut; never a jagged one.  The method of examining the hu=
man body after=20

death will vary somewhat according to the objects in view. These objects ma=
y be threefold: (1) To=20

ascertain whether a person has died from violence or poison; (2) to establi=
sh the cause of death,=20

especially if it has been sudden; and (3) to ascertain the lesion of a dise=
ase, or to confirm a=20

diagnosis.  The only difference between a medico-legal and pathological aut=
opsy is that in the=20

former case everything which might subserve the ends of justice should be c=
arefully noted, and=20

the changes found most accurately described; especially any abnormalities f=
ound on the external=20

examination of the body. A photograph should be taken of the body.  The hea=
d should be opened=20

and the brain examined first, and not last, as is often done in the ordinar=
y autopsy.  Careful notes=20

should be taken during each step of the examination, to be reread, verified=
, and signed at the=20

completion of the autopsy.  It must be remembered that most of the lesions =
of disease which are=20

found, indicate the disease rather than the cause of death; that often the =
lesion found will seem=20

hardly extensive enough to cause death, and that from accidents and injurie=
s apparently trivial,=20

death may result. It must often be acknowledged that no sufficient cause of=
 death can be found,=20

but the more accurate and careful the examinations (especially when a micro=
scopical examination=20

of the organs is made) the fewer will be the number of such cases. If no ap=
parent lesion is found, it=20

must not be forgotten that many poisons destroy life and leave no trace tha=
t the pathologist can=20

discover.  Care should always be exercised not to mistake the ordinary post=
-mortem appearance=20

which we find at autopsies for the lesions of disease.  The examination of =
the human body,=20

whether it be made from a medico-legal or pathological standpoint, is divid=
ed into two main=20

divisions:  (1) The external examination, and  (2) The internal examination=
.   EXTERNAL=20

EXAMINATION.  Its minuteness will depend on the character of the case, as w=
hen the person is=20

unknown, or when suspected to have died from unnatural causes. In such case=
s the external=20

examination is very important.  The following are the steps to be followed:=
  (1) Give a =3Dgeneral=20

description=3D of the body; apparent age, height, and weight of the individ=
ual; color of the hair and=20

eyes; condition of the teeth; and the evidence of any personal peculiaritie=
s or abnormalities.  (2)=20

Note the =3Dcolor of the skin=3D and observe whether there are any spots of=
 CADAVERIC LIVIDITY,=20

and if present where situated.  (3) =3DContusions.=3D=E2=80=94Note whether =
there are any contusions, and, if=20

present, their character, situation, length, breadth, and depth should be d=
escribed, and whether=20

they are accompanied by inflammation or by the evidences of gangrene.  It i=
s often important to=20

determine whether a contusion has been inflicted before or after death. Thi=
s is to be done by=20

cutting into the ecchymoses and if the extravasated blood or the coloring m=
atter of the blood is=20

found free in the tissues, one can be almost certain that it is an ante-mor=
tem injury. In post-

mortem discolorations the blood is found in the congested vessels. The situ=
ation of ante-mortem=20

contusions will not generally correspond to the discolorations produced by =
decomposition; the=20

latter being confined to the most dependent parts. It should be remembered =
that the contusions=20

produced by blows on a body dead only a few hours cannot be distinguished f=
rom those which=20

were received during life; and also that putrefactive changes make it well-=
nigh impossible to=20

distinguish between ante-mortem and post-mortem injuries. It should also be=
 borne in mind that=20

blows or falls sufficient to fracture bones or rupture organs may leave no =
mark on the skin (see=20

WOUNDS, Vol. I., pp. 467, 474, _et seq._).  (4) =3DWounds.=3D=E2=80=94The s=
ituation, depth, extent, and=20

direction of any wound should be recorded, as also the condition of its edg=
es; the changes in the=20



surrounding tissues, and whether inflicted by a cutting, pointed, or rounde=
d instrument; or by a=20

bullet. In the=20

Calais, to be the judge of our combat, as I had written to you by Aly the p=

 THE THIRD LETTER=20

WRITTEN AND SENT BY THE ENGLISH KNIGHT TO         THE ESQUIRE OF ARRAGON.  =
=E2=80=98To=20

the honourable man Michel d=E2=80=99Orris, John Prendergast, knight, sends =
greeting.  =E2=80=98You will be=20

pleased to remember, that you sent, by Aly the poursuivant, a general chall=
enge, addressed to all=20

english knights, written at Paris on Friday the 27th day of May 1400, seale=
d with the seal of your=20

arms. You must likewise recollect the answer I sent to your challenge, as a=
n english knight who=20

had first seen your defiance; which answer, and all that has since passed b=
etween us, I have=20

renewed in substance, in my letters sealed with my arms, and bearing date t=
he last day but one of=20

April just passed. I likewise sent you a good and sufficient passport to co=
me hither, and perform=20

the promises held out by your letter, addressed to you in a manner similar =
to that of this present=20

letter.  =E2=80=98Know, therefore, that I am greatly astonished, considerin=
g the purport of my letters, that I=20

have not received any answer, and that you have not kept your appointment, =
by meeting me on=20

the day fixed on, nor sent any sufficient excuse for this failure. I am ign=
orant if the god of love, who=20

inspired you with the courage to write your challenge, have since been disp=
leased, and changed=20

his ancient pleasures, which formerly consisted in urging on deeds of arms,=
 and in the delights of=20



chivalry.  =E2=80=98He kept the nobles of his court under such good governm=
ent[18] that, to add to their=20

honour, after having undertaken any deeds of arms, they could not absent th=
emselves from the=20

country where such enterprise was to be performed until it was perfectly ac=
complished, and this=20

caused their companions not to labour or exert themselves in vain. I would =
not, therefore, he=20

should find me so great a defaulter in this respect as to banish me from hi=
s court, and,=20

consequently, shall remain here until the eighth day of this present month =
of May, ready, with the=20

aid of God, of St George and of St Anthony, to deliver you, so that your la=
dy and mine may know=20

that, out of respect to them, I am willing to ease you of your penance, whi=
ch, according to the=20

tenor of your letter, you have suffered a long time, and have sufficient re=
ason for wishing to be=20

relieved from it.  =E2=80=98After the above-mentioned period, should you be=
 unwilling to come, I intend,=20

under God=E2=80=99s pleasure, to return to England, to our ladies, where I =
hope to God that knights and=20

esquires will bear witness that I have not misbehaved toward the god of cou=
rse and direction of=20

the ball should be ascertained by dissection rather than by the use of the =
probe, and the character=20

of foreign bodies, if any are found in the wound, should be noted. What ner=
ves or blood-vessels,=20

particularly arteries, have been injured, should be ascertained. It is ofte=
n important to determine=20

whether a wound was made before or after death. The following may serve as =
a differential point:=20

In all wounds made after death there is slight bleeding, non-contraction of=
 the edges, and absence=20

of blood in the tissues. This is the opposite of ante-mortem wounds. Again,=
 wounds inflicted within=20

two hours after death cannot be differentiated from those made during life =
(see GUNSHOT=20

WOUNDS, Vol. I., p. 610 _et seq._; WOUNDS, Vol. I., p. 476 _et seq._).  (5)=
 =3DFractures.=3D=E2=80=94If=20

there are any evidences of fractures, the situation of the bones involved s=
hould be noted, and=20

whether they are accompanied by contusions of the soft parts. Fractures whi=
ch are inflicted during=20

life are always accompanied by much more extravasation of blood, more injur=
y to the soft parts,=20

and more evidences of reaction than those occurring after death. It is a we=
ll-known fact that it is=20

much more difficult to produce a fracture in a dead than a living body (see=
 WOUNDS, Vol. II., p.=20

482 _et seq._).  (6) =3DThe temperature=3D of the body should be taken.  (7=
) =3DThe rigidity and=20

flexibility=3D of the extremities should be ascertained.  (8) =3DThe state =
of the eyes=3D should be noticed,=20

and the relative size of the pupils.  (9) Attention should be paid to the c=
ondition of the cavities of=20

the mouth and nose. The neck should be specially examined for marks of exte=
rnal injury, or signs=20

of ecchymosis or compression.  (10) =3DGenitals.=3D=E2=80=94The external ge=
nitals should be very carefully=20

examined for evidence of injury, the presence of syphilitic lesions, and in=
 the female the condition=20

of the vagina should be particularly ascertained.  (11) =3D=C5=92dema of th=
e Feet.=3D=E2=80=94If there is evidence=20

of =C5=93dema in any part of the body, especially about the ankles, its sit=
uation and extent should be=20

noted.  (12) =3DUlcers and Abscesses.=3D=E2=80=94The situation and extent o=
f any ulcer found on the body=20

should be recorded, as also the presence and situation of any abscess.  (13=
) =3DBurns.=3D=E2=80=94The=20

extent of a burn, as also the state of the parts involved, should be noted.=
 For example, whether=20

they are inflamed or show blisters, etc. (see HEAT AND COLD, Vol. I., p. 64=
7 _et seq._).  (14)=20

=3DHands.=3D=E2=80=94In medico-legal cases the hands of a dead person shoul=
d always be examined for the=20

presence of cuts, excoriations, or foreign substances found upon them; espe=
cially should the=20

dorsal extremities be examined. This examination will often indicate that t=
here has been a mortal=20

struggle before death. The impression of a hand or of some of the fingers i=
s often found on the=20

skin of a dead body. The exact situation where found should be noted. This =
may be of importance,=20



as when it occurs where it would have been impossible or improbable for the=
 deceased to have=20

caused it.  For appearances in death from lightning or electricity, see Vol=
. I., p. 701 _et seq._, and=20

in death from hanging, strangulation, and garroting, see Vol. I., pp. 713, =
746, 781, _et seq._=20

INTERNAL EXAMINATION.  Having completed the examination of the external par=
ts of the body,=20

the next proceeding is to open the body and make an internal examination.  =
This should be done=20

by following a regular method, so as to examine the relations of parts and =
not to injure one organ=20

while removing another.  In opening the various organs an incision should b=
e made which will=20

expose the greatest amount of surface at one cut. Never make a number of sm=
all and always=20

unsatisfactory incisions in an organ. In opening certain organs like the br=
ain and heart, the=20

incisions are so planned that the parts of the organ may be folded together=
, and, if necessary, their=20

relations to one another and the whole organ studied. Such organs are opene=
d as one would open=20

a book to examine its pages.  It is important to remember that after death =
the blood leaves the=20

arteries and left side of the heart, and collects in the veins and the righ=
t cavities of the heart.=20

Especially does it collect in the vessels of the most dependent portions of=
 the body and of the=20

various organs, so that local congestions may often disappear after death; =
and again, they may be=20

found at an autopsy where they were not present during life. Especially is =
this true of the mucous=20

membranes such as those of the trachea and bronchi, and also of the blood i=
n the sinuses of the=20

dura mater.  In making autopsies it is a cardinal rule that _all_ the cavit=
ies of the body should be=20

examined, and not alone the one where one might expect to find a lesion. At=
 medico-legal=20

autopsies, the great cavities=E2=80=94the head, the thorax, and the abdomen=
=E2=80=94should be examined in=20

their successive order from above downward. The reason for beginning with t=
he head is that the=20

amount of blood in the brain and its membranes may be determined accurately=
; for, if the heart=20

and great vessels of the neck are opened first, the blood will drain away f=
rom the brain and local=20

congestions=20

THE ANSWERS THE=20

ARRAGONIAN ESQUIRE SENT TO THE LETTERS OF         THE ENGLISH KNIGHT.  =E2=

most noble personage sir John Prendergast, knight,  =E2=80=98I Michel d=E2=
=80=99Orris, esquire, native of the=20

kingdom of Arragon, make known, that from the ardent and courageous desire =
I have had, and=20

always shall have so long as it may please God to grant me life, to employ =
my time in arms, so=20

suitable to every gentleman; knowing that in the kingdom of England there w=
ere very many knights=20

of great prowess, who, in my opinion, had been too long asleep, to awaken t=
hem from their=20

indolence, and to make acquaintance with some of them, I attached to my leg=
 a part of a greve,=20

vowing to wear it until I should be delivered by a knight of that country, =
and, in consequence, wrote=20

my challenge at Paris, the 27th day of May in the year 1400, and which was =
carried by the=20

poursuivant Aly, as your letters, dated the 11th of December, from Calais, =
testify.  =E2=80=98I thank you for=20

what is contained at the commencement of your said letter, since you seem w=
illing to deliver me=20

from the pain I am in, as your gracious expressions testify; and you declar=
e you have long been=20

desirous of making acquaintance with some valiant man of France. That you m=
ay not be ignorant=20

who I am, I inform you that I am a native of the kingdom of Arragon, not th=
at myself nor any=20

greater person may claim a superior rank from having been born in France; f=
or although no one=20

can reproach the French with any disgraceful act, or with any thing unbecom=
ing a gentleman, or=20

that truth would wish to hide, yet no honest man should deny his country. I=
 therefore assure you,=20

that I have had, and shall continue to have, the same desire for the fulfil=
ment of my engagement,=20

according to the proposals contained in my letter, until it be perfectly ac=
complished.  =E2=80=98It is true that=20

I formed this enterprise while living in Arragon; but seeing I was too far =
distant from England for=20

the speedy accomplishment of it, I set out for Paris, where I staid a very =
considerable time after I=20

had sent off my challenge.  =E2=80=98Business[19] respecting my sovereign l=
ord the king of Arragon forced=20

me to leave France; and I returned very melancholy to my own country, and s=
urprised at the=20

dilatoriness of so many noble knights in the amusement I offered them, for =
I had not any answer=20

during the space of two years that I was detained in Arragon from the quarr=
els of my friends.  =E2=80=98I=20

then took leave of my lord, and returned to Paris to learn intelligence res=
pecting my challenge. I=20

there found, at the h=C3=B4tel of the lord de Gaucourt, in the hands of Jea=
n d=E2=80=99Olmedo his esquire, your=20

letters, which had been brought thither after my departure for Arragon. Why=
 they were brought=20

hither after I had set out, I shall not say any thing, but leave every one =
to judge of the=20

circumstance as he may please. Your letter has much the opening of the head=
 first is not so=20

important, and often the vertebral column need not be opened at all, for it=
 is a complicated process=20

and takes time; but in medico-legal cases, especially where a question as t=
o the cause of death=20

may arise, and has not satisfactorily been determined, after all the other =
cavities are examined the=20

vertebral column should always be opened and the cord removed.   THE HEAD. =
 Make an incision=20

across the vertex of the skull from ear to ear. Dissect the anterior flap f=
orward until within about=20

three inches of the bridge of the nose, and the posterior flap backward to =
the external occipital=20

protuberance. Examine the internal surface of the scalp for ecchymosis and =
evidences of injury. A=20

circular incision is then made with a saw through the cranium as far backwa=
rd and forward as the=20

flaps have been reflected. An incision through the temporal muscle is neces=
sary so that the teeth=20

of the saw may not become clogged by the muscle fibres. When the cranium ha=
s been sawed=20



through, a stout hook is inserted under its upper edge and it is removed wi=
th a quick jerk. If the=20

dura mater is very adherent to the calvaria, it may be necessary to remove =
it with the bone, by=20

cutting through it at the level of the cranial incision. Examine the calvar=
ia as also the other bones=20

of the skull after the brain has been removed and the dura stripped off, fo=
r evidence of fracture.=20

Note the symmetry, thickness, and density of the cranial bone, and remember=
 that depressions=20

along the sagittal suture are for the Pacchionian bodies, and are not patho=
logical.  =3DDura=20

Mater.=3D=E2=80=94The dura mater may be slightly adherent to the bone of th=
e cranium. This is especially=20

seen in old people and does not indicate disease. The Pacchionian bodies ar=
e seen along the=20

longitudinal sinus. Examine the internal surface of the dura mater for the =
presence of clots,=20

tumors, or inflammatory lesions. Open the longitudinal sinus and examine fo=
r thrombi. Remove the=20

dura mater by an incision following the cranial incision, the falx cerebri =
between the anterior lobes=20

being drawn back and divided. Note whether the dura mater is adherent to th=
e pia mater, and the=20

condition of its internal surface.  =3DPia Mater.=3D=E2=80=94The brain, cov=
ered by the pia mater, is now=20

exposed. Note the degree of congestion of the membrane, its adherence, and =
the existence of=20

pus, blood, or serum on its surface or in its meshes. Remember that a consi=
derable amount of=20

serum may be present within normal limits, especially in cachectic subjects=
, without indicating=20

disease, but when the serum is so extensive as to raise the pia mater and t=
o depress the=20

convolutions, we have a pathological amount which may be a simple dropsy du=
e to some general=20

cause, or the result of a chronic meningitis. Enough serous effusion in the=
 pia mater to produce a=20

condition which has been called by some writers =E2=80=9Cserous apoplexy,=
=E2=80=9D I believe never occurs as a=20

primary condition.  Loss of transparency and thickening of the pia mater, e=

adult male brain is forty-nine and one-half ounces; of the female, forty-fo=
ur ounces. Its proportional=20

weight to that of the rest of the body is as 1 to 45.  Lay the brain first =
upon its convex surface and=20

examine the arteries at the base for atheroma, thrombi, emboli, and aneuris=
ms. Examine the pia=20

mater of the base, especially for the evidences of hemorrhage, tumors, tube=
rcles, and=20

inflammatory lesions. Next turn the brain over on its base, and proceed to =
open its various cavities=20

and examine its internal=20


_
heart to have this deed of arms accomplished; and for this have I twice tra=
velled from my own=20

country, a distance of two hundred and fifty leagues, at much inconvenience=
 and great expense,=20

as is well known.  =E2=80=98In your letters, you inform me, that you have f=
ixed on Calais as the place where=20

our meeting should be held in the presence of the noble and puissant prince=
 the earl of Somerset;=20

and afterward your letters say, that as he was otherwise occupied, your sov=
ereign lord the king of=20

England, at your request, had nominated sir Hugh Lutrellier, lieutenant to =
the earl of Somerset in=20

his government of Calais, judge between us, without ever having had my cons=
ent, or asking for it,=20

which has exceedingly, and with just cause, astonished me,=E2=80=94for how =
could you, without my=20

permission, take such advantages as to name the judge of the field and fix =
on the place of=20

combat?  =E2=80=98It seems to me, that you are very unwilling to lose sight=
 of your own country; and yet our=20

ancestors, those noble knights who have left us such examples to follow, ne=
ver acquired any great=20

honours in their own countries, nor were accustomed to make improper demand=
s, which are but=20

checks to gallant deeds. corpus callosum is exposed. Make an incision downw=
ard and outward at=20

the junction of the corpus callosum with the cerebrum, and the roof of the =
lateral ventricles will be=20

cut through and their cavities exposed. Prolong the incision forward and ba=
ckward so as to expose=20

the cornua. The size and contents of the ventricles should be noted, as als=
o the condition of the=20

ependyma. The floor of the lateral ventricles being the most frequent spot =
of hemorrhage, if one is=20

found its extent and the parts involved by it should be noted; especially i=
ts relation to the internal=20

capsule.  Transverse incisions (about one-sixteenth of an inch apart) are m=
ade through the=20

ganglia seen on the floor of the lateral ventricles. Thus any lesions in th=
e substance of the ganglia=20

will be disclosed. Three or four longitudinal incisions are now made outwar=
d into the hemispheres=20

nearly to the pia mater. These will divide the hemispheres into long, prism=
-shaped pieces held=20

together by the pia mater and a little of the cortex, thus enabling the bra=
in afterward to be folded=20

together, and the relations of lesions to the brain as a whole studied. The=
 third ventricle is now=20

examined by cutting=20


_
=E2=80=98I am fully aware, that you cannot be so ignorant as not to know th=
at the choice of the judge, and of=20

the time and place of combat, must be made with the mutual assent of the tw=
o parties; and if I had=20

received your letters, you should sooner have heard this from me.  =E2=80=
=98With regard to what you say,=20

that you are ignorant whether the god of love have banished me from his cou=
rt, because I had=20

absented myself from France, where my first letter was callosum at the fora=
men of Monroe. Next,=20

the fourth ventricle is opened by a longitudinal incision through the lower=
 portion of the vermiform=20

process; its contents, the condition of its vessels and ependyma noted. The=
n the floor of the fourth=20

ventricle is divided by transverse incisions one-sixteenth of an inch apart=
, and careful examination=20

made for the presence of minute hemorrhages: for here is a place in the bod=
