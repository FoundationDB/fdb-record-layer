1.E.8.   You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing 

Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works provided that      - You pay a royalty 

fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from       the use of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK 

SIGN~} works calculated using the method you       already use to calculate your applicable taxes. 

The fee is owed to       the owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} trademark, but 

he has agreed to       donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg       Literary 

Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60       days following each date on 

which you prepare (or are legally       required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty 

payments       should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg       Literary 

Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4,       "Information about donations to the 

Project Gutenberg Literary       Archive Foundation."        You provide a full refund of any money 

paid by a user who notifies       you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he 

does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License. 

You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the       works  This causes the 

water to circulate rapidly between them to the top of the flue, and protects it from being run dry, or 

heated red hot, when the water gets, by accident, too low. The lining also _causes the steam to 

form much faster, in consequence of this circulation_.  The other is the interior boiler. A vessel 

occupying the back part of the flue. Plate II. Fig. 8. (_d_) communicating downwards with the 

water, and upwards with the steam of the main boiler. The fire acts upon it very forcibly, 

surrounding it on all sides.  I have said there is no reciprocating movement in Morey's engine. 

Should it be objected that the piston moves in the cylinder as usual, it must be apparent that it also 

moves circularly; it is in fact the cylinder that moves, carrying the piston with it, which gives and 

keeps up the motion, by drawing and pressing on the centre-piece, and communicating the 

resistance thence to the _guides_ of the cross-piece on the insides of the frame, which thus 

receives its motion.  In fact, this form of the engine seems divested of all the usual drawbacks on 

its power, and leaves it to act freely with any velocity, according to the strength of the steam in the 

boilers.  Such it appears in principle, and such thus far in practise. I have therefore preferred it for 

the purposes of navigation, and have purchased the patent

all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works.        You provide, 

in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of       any money paid for a work or a 

replacement copy, if a defect in the       electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 

days of       receipt of the work.        You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free 

distribution of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works.   1.E.9.   If you wish to charge a 

fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work or group of works on 

different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from 

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the Project 

Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 

below.   1.F.   1.F.1.   Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to 

identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the 

Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection. Despite these efforts, Project 

Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works, and the medium on which they may be 

stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, 

transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged 

disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by 

your equipment.   1.F.2.   LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES -- Except for the 

"Right of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary 

Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} trademark, and 

any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work under 

this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. 

YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, 

BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF I cannot expect it to be preferred by the intelligent, if 

there is not merit in the invention, and great economy in its use. It may be considered the most 

direct application of the power, and the most unexceptionable mode of using the expansive force 

of high steam. And from the nature of its movement the most applicable to boats and vessels. 

Your Journal being the intended medium of information to promote the useful arts, I hope it may 

be consistent with this object to explain the manner in which these improvements may be made 

extensively useful.  It being necessary to supply the engines at a reasonable rate, I have 

established a manufactory for this kind only. The great expense of steam-boats hitherto, has 

confined their use too exclusively to the accommodation of passengers. There is a wide field 

opening for their use, in freighting, on all our waters; and it is often of importance to a community, 

when great savings can be made, that large capitalists should be induced to engage that such 

savings may be greater. Where companies are formed for an extensive operation, the legislature 

may, with propriety, grant an extension of the time for patents to run, that such persons may be 

duly remunerated for their enterprise, by the duration of the service.  Our laws do not yet make a 

proper distinction between patents of a large and expensive kind and those requiring little or no 

capital to go into operation. The period of fourteen years remunerates the inventor of those 

improvements only that require no capital, and involve no risk.  On this ground several of the State 

legislatures have, with good policy, given encouragement to this kind of enterprise. They suspend 

the free use of the invention a few years, rather than loose its immediate operation on a large 

scale of public benefit.  The constitutionality of the measure plainly appears by its not interfering 



with the laws of the United States. It is not an act exclusive of, or in opposition to, patents, but 

acknowledging and confirming them. It is furthering and giving effect to the intentions of the

FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS 

AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, 

CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF 

THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.   1.F.3.   LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR 

REFUND -- If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can 

receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person 

you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the 

medium with your written explanation. The person or entity useful inventions. For their own 

particular section of the union, a State legislature may thus provide for the protection of capital, 

engaged in enterprise of uncommon risk, as well as of uncommon usefulness, without excluding 

other and better inventions, should they arise.  I shall ask leave to communicate, for some future 

Number, the results of experiments, now making, with the gas fire applied to engines.    I am your 

most respectful humble servant,    JOHN L. SULLIVAN     ART. XVI. _Cautions regarding

person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the

refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.   1.F.4.   Except for the limited a

and other glasses, several of which were within 6 or 8 inches. A small quantity of the
