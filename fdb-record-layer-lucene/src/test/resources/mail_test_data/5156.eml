an amiable and benevolent effect. His master, indeed, he looked upon with benevolent 

indulgence, as knowing no more than a child of the chief incident. If Rolls had not been already

[_Taking them in her apron with pride._] Thank 'em kindly. When's their evening?  BLORE.  We 

receive on Toosdays, at the side gate. And 'ow are you, my dear?  [_Kissing her cheek._ 

HANNAH.  Don't, Edward Blore!  BLORE.  Don't! When you was Miss Hevans there wasn't these 

social barriers, 'Annah!  HANNAH.  Shut up! Noah's jealous of the very apron-strings what go 

round my waist. I'm not so free and 'andy with my kisses now, I can tell you.  BLORE.  Then "what 

is friendship but a name!" But Mr. Topping isn't indoors now, surely!  HANNAH.  [_Nodding her 

head._] Um--um!  BLORE.  Why, he took a man up last night!  HANNAH.  What of it?  BLORE. 

Why, I thought that when hany harrest was made in St. Marvells, the prisoner was lodged here 

honly for the night and that the 'ead Constable 'ad to drive 'im over to Durnstone Police Station the 

first thing in the morning.  HANNAH.  by that identification of himself and all his interests, his pride 

and self-regard, with his "family," which is something even more tenacious and real than 

faithfulness, he would have been made so by the fact that John, without in the slightest degree 

realising that Rolls was suffering for him, had given orders to Mr Monypenny to secure the most 

expensive assistance for his trial. The pride, contempt, satire, and keen suppressed emotion with 

which this act filled the old servant's bosom, were beyond description. "It was just downright 

extravagance," he said to Bauby; "they're a' fuils, thae Erskines, frae father to son. Laying out all 

that siller upon me; and no' a glimmer o' insight a' the time. An' he had had the sense to see, it 

would have been natural; but how could he divine my meaning when there was no conscience in

That's the rule, but Noah's behindhand to-day, and ain't going into Durnstone till after dinner. 

BLORE.  Then the prisoner is now hon the premises!  HANNAH.  Yes, he's in our cell.  BLORE. 

Ah! And where is the hapartment in question?  HANNAH.  The cell? That's it!  BLORE.  [_Looking 

round in horror._] Oh!  HANNAH.  The "Strong-box" they call it in St. Marvells.  BLORE.  Oh, my

meaning was good," said Bauby. Their position was changed by all the changes that had 

happened, to the increase of their grandeur if not of their happiness. Rolls had now a tall and 

respectful youth under his orders, and Bauby was relieved, in so far as she would allow herself to
