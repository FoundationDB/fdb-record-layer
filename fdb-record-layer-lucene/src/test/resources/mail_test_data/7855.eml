someday."  "There's no reason why you can't join the organization if you're=
 willing to live up to the rules," Mr. Hatfield assured him. "We'll give yo=

hat mean?" Jack asked curiously.  "Those two fingers signify the ears of th=

"After that, you didn't make another attempt to return the money?"  "I didn=

steal from my own uncle. I know you won't believe my story."  "On the contr=

have told us tallies with the facts as we know them," Mr. Hatfield assured =

against Krajiek. "The way he acted, and the way his axe fit the wound, was =
enough to convict any=20

man."  Although it was perfectly clear that Mr. Shimerda had killed himself=
, Jake and the coroner=20

thought something ought to be done to Krajiek because he behaved like a gui=
lty man. He was=20

badly frightened, certainly, and perhaps he even felt some stirrings=20

"Well, that's my story and it's all there is to it," the tramp said, making=
 a despairing gesture with his=20

hands. "You may as well take me off to jail now."  The troopers escorted th=
e man to the waiting=20

car. As the man left the home, he paused in the doorway to direct a word to=
 the Cubs.  "No hard=20

feelings, boys," he said. "You fellows made it plenty tough for me, but I'm=
 not blaming anyone=20

except myself. I led a useless life and I got what's coming to me!"  After =
the car had driven away,=20

Mr. Hatfield told the Cubs they must return to Webster City without further=
 delay. So much time=20

had elapsed that he was afraid lest their parents worry.  "Jack, we owe you=
 a lot," he said, shaking=20

the boy's hand. "Through your cooperation, my name will be completely clear=
ed, and Mr. Merrimac=20

will have his money again. Many thanks not only from me but from all the Cu=
bs."  "Sure, that's=20

okay," the boy replied in deep embarrassment. He hesitated, and then with a=
 darting glance at=20

Mrs. Jones asked: "Are you going to send me back to the Institute?"  "Send =
you back?" Mrs.=20

Jones demanded with a quick laugh which had real affection. "Why, Jack! Wha=
t an idea! I need=20

you here to help me."  "You do? You aren't just man's misery and loneliness=
.  At supper the men=20

ate like vikings, and the chocolate cake, which I had hoped would linger on=
 until to-morrow in a=20

mutilated condition, disappeared on the second round. They talked excitedly=
 about where they=20

should bury Mr. Shimerda; I gathered that the neighbors were all disturbed =
and shocked about=20

something. It developed that Mrs. Shimerda and Ambrosch wanted the old man =
buried on the=20

southwest corner of their own land; indeed, under the very stake that marke=
d the corner.=20

Grandfather had explained to Ambrosch that some day, when the country was p=
ut under fence=20

and the roads were confined to section lines, two roads would cross exactly=
 on that corner. But=20

Ambrosch only said, "It makes no matter."  Grandfather asked Jelinek whethe=
r in the old country=20

there was some superstition to the effect that a suicide must be buried at =
the cross-roads.  Jelinek=20

said he did n't know; he seemed to remember hearing there had once been suc=
h a custom in=20

Bohemia. "Mrs. Shimerda is made up her mind," he added. "I try to persuade =
her, and say it looks=20

bad for her to all the neighbors; but she say so it must be. 'There I will =
bury him, if I dig the grave=20

myself,' she say. I have to=20

"Jack, I truly need and want you," the widow repeated. "Since my own sons g=

another boy the worst way. One I could depend on. Shucks! I wouldn't have a=
 boy without spirit!"=20

"I'll never run away again," Jack said earnestly. "I promise!"  "When a Cub=
 gives a promise, he=20

never breaks it," Mr. Hatfield reminded him. grave to-morrow."  Grandfather=
 smoothed his beard=20

and looked judicial. "I don't know whose wish should decide the matter, if =
not hers. But if she=20

thinks she will live to see the people of this country ride over that old m=
an's head, she is=20

mistaken."     XVI   MR. SHIMERDA lay dead in the barn four days, and on th=
