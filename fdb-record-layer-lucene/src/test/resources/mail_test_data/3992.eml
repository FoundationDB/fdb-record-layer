unquiet place. There was a sense of unseen things on all sides watching her=
 and waiting.  Was=20

this another form of the dark room--a trap set up in her mind? Telzey's att=
ention did a quick shift.=20

She was seated in the grass again; the sunlight beyond her closed eyelids s=
eemed to shine in=20

quietly through rose-tinted curtains. Cautiously, she let her awareness ret=
urn to the bright area;=20

and it was still there. She had a moment of excited elation. She was contro=
lling this! And why not,=20

she asked herself. These things were happening in her mind, after all!  She=
 would find out what=20

they seemed to mean; but she would be in no rush to....  An impression as i=
f, behind her, Tick-

Tock had thought, "Now I can help again!"  Then a feeling of being swept sw=
iftly, irresistibly=20

forwards, thrust out and down. The brightness exploded in thundering colors=
 around her. In fright,=20

she made the effort to snap her eyes open, to be back in the garden; but no=
w she couldn't make it=20

work. The colors continued to roar about her, like a confusion of excited, =
laughing, triumphant=20

voices. Telzey felt caught in the middle of it all,  =E2=80=9CYou do not li=
ke to be amused?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot too much; I=20

like to be interested.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell,=E2=80=9D said Miss Arundel,=
 =E2=80=9Cso long as a person can talk agreeably, I am=20

satisfied. I think to talk well a rare gift; quite as rare as singing; and =
yet you expect every one to be=20

able to talk, and very few to be able to sing.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere are=
 amusing people who do not interest,=E2=80=9D said=20

the monsignore, =E2=80=9Cand interesting people who do not amuse. What I li=
ke is an agreeable person.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CMy idea of an agreeable person,=E2=80=9D said Hugo Bohun, =E2=80=
=9Cis a person who agrees with me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTalking=20

of singing, something is going to happen,=E2=80=9D said Miss Arundel.  A no=
te was heard; a celebrated=20

professor had entered the room and was seated at the piano, which he had ju=
st touched. There=20

was a general and unconscious hush, and the countenance of Lord St. Aldegon=
de wore a rueful=20

expression. But affairs turned out better than could be anticipated. A youn=
g and pretty girl, dressed=20

in white, with a gigantic sash of dazzling beauty, played upon the violin w=
ith a grace, and=20

sentimental and marvellous skill, and passionate expression, worthy of St. =
Cecilia. She was a=20

invisible spider webs. Tick-Tock seemed to be somewhere nearby, looking on.=
 Faithless,=20

treacherous TT!  Telzey's mind made another wrenching effort, and there was=
 a change. She=20

hadn't got back into the garden, but the noisy, swirling colors were gone a=
nd she had the feeling of=20

reading a rapidly moving microtape now, though she didn't actually see the =
tape.  The tape, she=20

realized, was another symbol debut. Everybody praised her, and every body w=
as pleased; and=20

Lord St. Aldegonde, instead of being bored, took a wondrous rose out of his=
 button-hole and=20

presented it to her.  The performance only lasted half an hour, and then th=
e ladies began to think=20

of their bowers. Lady St. Aldegonde, before she quit the room, was in earne=
st conversation with=20

her lord.  =E2=80=9CI have arranged all that you wished,=20
