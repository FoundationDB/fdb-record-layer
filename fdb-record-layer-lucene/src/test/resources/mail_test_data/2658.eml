st man in the _
with his mouth up in the air. And so at last I lost my temper, and I snatch=
ed up my gun and struck=20

him with the butt-end of it. My poor Rolf!" said Uncle Pick, all at once, w=
ith a falter in his voice; and=20

he stopped abruptly, and stooped down and laid his hand on the great black =
head.  "He was=20

quieter after I had struck him," said Uncle Dick, after a little pause. "Fo=
r a few moments he lay=20

quite still at my feet, and I had begun to think that his crazy fit was ove=
r, and that he was going to=20

give me no more trouble, when all at once, just as I had got ready to jump =
into the water, the=20

creature sprang to his feet and flung himself upon me again. He threw himse=
lf with all his might=20

upon my breast and drove me backwards, howling So wildly that many a time s=
ince, boys, I have=20

thought I must have been no better than a blind, perverse fool, not to have=
 guessed what the=20

trouble was; but the fact is, I was a conceited young fellow (as most young=
 fellows are), and=20

because I imagined the poor beast was trying for some reason of his own to =
get his own way, I=20

thought it was my business to teach him that he was not to get his own way,=
 but that I was to get=20

mine; and so I beat him down somehow,--I don't like to think of it now; I s=
truck him again three or=20

four times with the end of my gun, till at last I got myself freed from him=
.  "He gave a cry when he=20

fell back. I call it a cry, for it was more like something human than a dog=
's howl,--something so wild=20

and pathetic that, angry as I was, it startled me, and I almost think, if t=
ime enough had been given=20

me, I would have made some last attempt then to understand what the creatur=
e meant; but I had=20

no time after that. I was standing a few feet in from the water, and as soo=
n as I had shaken him off=20

he went to the edge of the bit of cliff, and stood there for a moment till =
I came up to him, and then--

just as in another second I should have jumped into the sea--my brave dog, =
my noble dog, gave=20

one last whine and one look into my face, and took the leap before me. And =
then, boys, in another=20

instant I saw what he had meant. He had scarcely touched the water when I s=
aw a crocodile slip=20

like lightning from a sunny ledge of the cliff, and grip him by the hinder =
legs.  "You know that I had=20

my gun close at hand, and in the whole course of my life I never was so gla=
d to have my gun=20

beside me. It was loaded, too, and a revolver. I caught it up, and fired in=
to the water. I fired three=20

times, and two of the shots went into the brute's head. One missed him, and=
 the first seemed not=20

to harm him much, but the third hit him in some vital place, I hope,--some =
sensitive place, at any=20

rate, for the hideous jaws started wide. Then, with my gun in my hand still=
, I began with all my=20

might to shout out, 'Rolf!" I couldn't leave my post, for the brute, though=
 he had let Rolf go, and=20

had dived for a moment, might make another spring, and I didn't dare to tak=
e my eyes off the spot=20

where he had gone down; but I called to my wounded beast with all my might,=
 and when he had=20

struggled through the water and gained a moment's hold of the rock, I jumpe=
d down and caught=20

him, and somehow--I don't know how--half carried and half dragged him up th=
e little bit of steep=20

ascent, till we were safe on the top,--on the dry land again. And then upon=
 my word, I don't know=20

what I did next, only I think, as I looked at my darling's poor crushed lim=
bs, with the blood oozing=20

from them, and heard his choking gasps for breath--I--I forgot for a moment=
 or two that I was a=20

man at all, and burst out crying like a child.  "Boys, you don't know what =
it is to feel that a living=20

creature has tried to give up his life for you, even though the creature is=
 only a soulless dog. Do=20

you think I had another friend in the world who would have done what Rolf h=
ad done for me? If I=20

had, I did not know it. And then when I thought that it was while he had be=
en trying to save my life=20

that I had taken up my gun and struck him! There are some things, my lads, =
that a man does=20

without meaning any harm by them, which yet, when he sees them by the light=
 of after events, he=20



can never bear to look back upon without a sort of agony; and those blows I=
 gave to Rolf are of=20

that sort. _He_ forgave them,--my noble dog; but I have never forgiven myse=
lf for them to this=20

hour. When I saw him lying before me, with his blood trickling out upon the=
 sand, I think I would=20

have given my right hand to save his life. And well I might, too, for he ha=
d done ten times more=20

than that to save mine.  "He licked the tears off my cheeks, my poor old fe=
llow; I remember that.=20

We looked a strange pair, I dare say, as we lay on the ground together, wit=
h our heads side by=20

side. It's a noble old head still, isn't it, boys? (I don't mean mine, but =
this big one down here. All=20

right, Rolf! We're only talking of your beauty, my lad.) It's as grand a he=
ad as ever a dog had. I had=20

his picture taken after I came home. I've had him painted more than once, b=
ut somehow I don't=20

think the painters have ever seen quite into the bottom of his heart. At le=
ast, I fancy that if I were a=20

painter I could make something better of him than any of them have done yet=
. Perhaps it's only a=20

notion of mine, but, to tell the truth, I've only a dozen times or so in my=
 life seen a painting of a=20

grand dog that looks quite right. But I'm wandering from my story, though, =
indeed, my story is=20

almost at an end.  "When I had come to my senses a little, I had to try to =
get my poor Rolf moved.=20

We were a long way from any house, and the creature couldn't walk a step. I=
 tore up my shirt, and=20

bound his wounds as well as I could, and then I got my clothes on, and call=
ed to my horse, and in=20

some way, as gently as I could,--though it was no easy thing to do it,--I g=
ot him and myself=20

together upon the horse's back, and we began our ride. There was a village =
about four or five=20

miles off, and I made for that. It was a long, hard jolt for a poor fellow =
with both his hindlegs=20

broken, but he bore it as patiently as if he had been a Christian. I never =
spoke to him but, panting=20

as he was, he was ready to lick my hands and look lovingly up into my face.=
 I've wondered since,=20

many a time, what he could have thought about it all; and the only thing I =
am sure of is that he=20

never thought much of the thing that he himself had done. That seemed, I kn=
ow, all natural and=20

simple to him; I don't believe that he has ever understood to this day what=
 anybody wondered at in=20

it, or made a hero of him for. For the noblest people are the people who ar=
e noble without knowing=20

it; and the same rule, I fancy, holds good, too, for dogs.  "I got him to a=
 resting-place at last, after a=20

weary ride, and then I had his wounds dressed; but it was weeks before he c=
ould stand upon his=20

feet again, and when at last he began to walk he limped, and he has gone on=
 limping ever since.=20

The bone of one leg was so crushed that it couldn't be set properly, and so=
 that limb is shorter=20

than the other three. _He_ doesn't mind it much, I dare say,--I don't think=
 he ever did,--but it has=20

been a pathetic lameness to me, boys. It's all an old story now, you know,"=
 said Uncle Dick,=20

abruptly, "but it's one of those things that a man doesn't forget, and that=
 it would be a shame to=20

him if he ever _could_ forget as long as his life lasts."  Uncle Dick stoop=
ed down again as he=20

ceased to speak, and Rolf, disturbed by the silence, raised his head to loo=
k about him. As his=20

master had said, it was a grand old head still, though the eyes were growin=
g dim now with age.=20

Uncle Dick laid his hand upon it, and the bushy tail began to wag. It had w=
agged at the touch of=20

that hand for many a long day.  "We've been together for fifteen years. He'=
s getting old now," said=20

Uncle Dick.    SCRAP  By Lucia Chamberlain  At the gray end of the afternoo=
n the regiment of=20

twelve companies went through Monterey on its way to the summer camp, a mil=
e out on the salt-

meadows; and it was here that Scrap joined it.  He did not tag at the heels=
 of the boys who tagged=20

the last company, or rush out with the other dogs who barked at the band; b=
ut he appeared=20

somehow independent of any surroundings, and marched, ears alert, stump tai=
l erect, one foot in=20



front of the tall first lieutenant who walked on the wing of Company A.  Th=
e lieutenant was self-

conscious and so fresh to the service that his shoulder-straps hurt him. He=
 failed to see Scrap,=20

who was very small and very yellow, until, in quickening step, he stumbled =
over him and all but=20

measured his long length. He aimed an accurate kick that sent Scrap flying,=
 surprised but not=20

vindictive, to the side lines, where he considered, his head cocked. With t=
he scratched ear pricked=20

and the bitten ear flat, he passed the regiment in review until Company K, =
with old Muldoon,=20

sergeant on the flank, came by.  As lean, as mongrel, as tough, and as scar=
red as Scrap, he=20

carried his wiry body with a devil-may-care assurance, in which Scrap may h=
ave recognized a=20

kindred spirit. He decided in a flash. He made a dart and fell in abreast t=
he sergeant of Company=20

K. Muldoon saw and growled at him.  "Gr-r-r-r!" said Scrap, not ill-natured=
ly, and fell back a pace.=20

But he did not slink. He had the secret of success. He kept as close as he =
could and yet escape=20

Muldoon's boot. With his head high, ears stiff, tail up, he stepped out to =
the music.  Muldoon=20

looked back with a threat that sent Scrap retreating, heels over ears. The =
sergeant was satisfied=20

that the dog had gone; but when camp was reached and ranks were broken he f=
ound himself=20

confronted by a disreputable yellow cur with a ragged ear cocked over his n=
ose.  "Well, I'm=20

domned!" said Muldoon. His heart, probably the toughest thing about him, wa=
s touched by this=20

fearless persistence.  "Ar-ren't ye afraid o' nothin', ye little scrap?" he=
 said. Scrap, answering the=20

first name he had ever known, barked shrilly.  "What's that dog doing here?=
" said the tall lieutenant=20

of Company A, disapprovingly.  "I'm afther kickin' him out, sor," explained=
 Muldoon, and, upon the=20

lieutenant's departure, was seen retreating in the direction of the cook-te=
nt, with the meager and=20

expectant Scrap inconspicuously at his heels.  He went to sleep at taps in =
Muldoon's tent, curled=20

up inside Muldoon's cartridge-belt; but at reveille the next morning the se=
rgeant missed him.=20

Between drill and drill Muldoon sought diligently, with insinuations as to =
the character of dog-

stealers that were near to precipitating personal conflict. He found the st=
ray finally, in Company B=20

street, leaping for bones amid the applause of the habitants.  Arraigned co=
llectively as thieves,=20

Company B declared that the dog had strayed in and remained only because he=
 could not be=20

kicked out. But their pride in the height of his leaps was too evidently th=
e pride of possession; and=20

Muldoon, after vain attempts to catch the excited Scrap, who was eager only=
 for bones, retired=20

with threats of some vague disaster to befall Company B the next day if _hi=
s_ dog were not=20

returned.  The responsibility, with its consequences, was taken out of Comp=
any B's hands by=20

Scrap's departure from their lines immediately after supper. He was not see=
n to go. He slid away=20

silently, among the broken shadows of the tents. Company B reviled Muldoon.=
 Scrap spent the=20

night in a bugler's cape, among a wilderness of brasses, and reappeared the=
 next morning at=20

guard mount, deftly following the stately maneuvers of the band.  "Talk abo=
ut a dorg's gratitude!"=20

said the sergeant of Company B, bitterly, remembering Scrap's entertainment=
 of the previous=20

evening.  "I'm on to his game!" muttered old Muldoon. "Don't ye see, ye foo=
l, he don't belong to=20

any _wan_ of us. He belongs to the crowd--to the regiment. That's what he's=
 tryin' to show us.=20

He's what that Frinchman down in F calls a--a mascot; and, be jabers, he mo=
ves like a soldier!"=20

The regiment's enthusiasm for Scrap, as voiced by Muldoon, was not extended=
 to the=20

commanding officer, who felt that the impressiveness of guard mount was det=
racted from by=20

Scrap's deployments. Also the tall lieutenant of Company A disliked the sen=
sation of being=20

accompanied in his social excursions among ladies who had driven out to ban=
d practise by a=20



lawless yellow pup with a bitten ear. The lieutenant, good fellow at bottom=
, was yet a bit of a snob,=20

and he would have preferred the colonel's foolish Newfoundland to the spiri=
ted but unregenerate=20

Scrap.  But the privates and "non-coms" judged by the spirit, and bid for t=
he favor of their favorite,=20

and lost money at canteen on the next company to be distinguished as Scrap'=
s temporary=20

entertainers. He was cordial, even demonstrative, but royally impartial, de=
voting a day to a=20

company with a method that was military. He had personal friends,--Muldoon =
for one, the cook for=20

another,--but there was no man in the regiment who could expect Scrap to ru=
n to his whistle.  Yet=20

independent as he was of individuals, he obeyed regimental regulations like=
 a soldier. He learned=20

the guns and the bugles, what actions were signified by certain sounds. He =
was up in the morning=20

with the roll of the drums. He was with every drill that was informal enoug=
h not to require the=20

presence of the commanding officer, and during dress parade languished, lam=
enting, in Muldoon's=20

tent. Barking furiously, he was the most enthusiastic spectator of target p=
ractise. He learned to find=20

the straying balls when the regimental nine practised during "release," and=
 betrayed a frantic=20

desire to "retrieve" the shot that went crashing seaward from the sullen-mo=
uthed cannon on the=20

shore. More than once he made one of the company that crossed the lines at =
an unlawful hour to=20

spend a night among the crooked ways of Monterey.  The regiment was tiresom=
e with tales of his=20

tricks. The height of his highest leap was registered in the mess, and the =
number of rats that had=20

died in his teeth were an ever increasing score in the canteen. He was fair=
ly aquiver with the mere=20

excitement and curiosity of living. There was no spot in the camp too secur=
e or too sacred for=20

Scrap to penetrate. His invasions were without impertinence; but the regime=
nt was his, and he=20

deposited dead rats in the lieutenant's shoes as casually as he concealed b=
ones in the French=20

horn; and slumbered in the major's hat-box with the same equanimity with wh=
ich he slept in=20

Muldoon's jacket.  The major evicted Scrap violently, but, being a good-nat=
ured man, said nothing=20

to the colonel, who was not. But it happened, only a day after the episode =
of the hat-box, that the=20

colonel entered his quarters to find the yellow mascot, fresh from a plunge=
 in the surf and a roll in=20

the dirt, reposing on his overcoat.  To say that the colonel was angry woul=
d be weak; but,=20

overwhelmed as he was, he managed to find words and deeds. Scrap fled with =
a sharp yelp as a=20

boot-tree caught him just above the tail.  His exit did not fail to attract=
 attention in the company=20

street. The men were uneasy, for the colonel was noticeably a man of action=
 as well as of temper.=20

Their premonitions were fulfilled when at assembly the next morning, an off=
icial announcement=20

was read to the attentive regiment. The colonel, who was a strategist as we=
ll as a fighter, had=20

considered the matter more calmly overnight. He was annoyed by the multipli=
city of Scrap's=20

appearances at times and places where he was officially a nuisance. He was =
more than annoyed=20

by the local paper's recent reference to "our crack yellow-dog regiment." B=
ut he knew the strength=20

of regimental sentiment concerning Scrap and the military superstition of t=
he mascot, and he did=20

not want to harrow the feelings of the "summer camp" by detailing a firing =
squad. Therefore he left=20

a loop-hole for Scrap's escape alive. The announcement read: "All dogs foun=
d in camp not=20

wearing collars will be shot, by order of the commanding officer."  Now the=
re were but two dogs in=20

camp, and the colonel's wore a collar. The regiment heard the order with co=
nsternation.  "That'll fix=20

it," said the colonel, comfortably.  "Suppose some one gets a collar?" sugg=
ested the major, with a=20

hint of hopefulness in his voice.  "I know my regiment," said the colonel. =
"There isn't enough=20

money in it three days before pay day to buy a button. They'll send him out=
 to-night."  Immediately=20



after drill there was a council of war in Muldoon's tent, Muldoon holding S=
crap between his knees.=20

Scrap's scratched ear, which habitually stood cocked, flopped forlornly; hi=
s stump tail drooped=20

dismally. The atmosphere of anxiety oppressed his sensitive spirit. He desi=
red to play, and=20

Muldoon only sat and rolled his argumentative tongue. From this conference =
those who had been=20

present went about the business of the day with a preternatural gloom that =
gradually permeated=20

the regiment. The business of the day was varied, since the next day was to=
 be a field day, with a=20

review in the morning and cavalry maneuvers in the afternoon.  All day Scra=
p was conspicuous in=20

every quarter of the camp, but at supper-time the lieutenant of Company A n=
oted his absence from=20

his habitual place at the left of Muldoon in the men's mess-tent. The lieut=
enant was annoyed by=20

his own anxiety.  "Of course they'll get him out, sir?" he said to the majo=
r.  "Of course," the major=20

assented, with more confidence than he felt. The colonel was fairly irritab=
le in his uncertainty over=20

it.  Next morning the sentries, who had been most strictly enjoined to vigi=
lant whiteness of its cross=20

of flowers, or the august authority of the bearers, that affected Priam Far=
ll like a blow on the heart?=20

Who knows? But the fact was that he could look no more; the scene was too m=
uch for him. Had=20

he continued to look he would have burst uncontrollably into tears. It matt=
ered not that the corpse=20

of a common rascally valet lay under that pall; it mattered not that a grot=
esque error was being=20

enacted; it mattered not whether the actuating spring of the immense affair=
 was the Dean's water-

colouring niece or the solemn deliberations of the Chapter; it mattered not=
 that newspapers had=20

ignobly misused the name and honour of art for their own advancement--the i=
nstant effect was=20

overwhelmingly impressive. All that had been honest and sincere in the hear=
t of England for a=20

thousand years leapt mystically up and made it impossible that the effect s=
hould be other than=20

overwhelmingly impressive. It was an effect beyond argument and reason; it =
was the magic=20

flowering of centuries in a single moment, the silent awful sigh of a natio=
n's saecular soul. It took=20

majesty and loveliness from the walls around it, and rendered them again te=
nfold. It left nothing=20

common, neither the motives nor the littleness of men. In Priam's mind it g=
ave dignity to Lady=20

Sophia Entwistle, and profound tragedy to the death of Leek; it transformed=
 even the gestures of=20

the choir-leader into grave commands.  And all that was for him! He had bru=
shed pigments on to=20

cloth in a way of his own, nothing more, and the nation to which he had alw=
ays denied artistic=20

perceptions, the nation which he had always fiercely accused of sentimental=
ity, was thus=20

solemnizing his committal to the earth! Divine mystery of art! The large ma=
gnificence of England=20

smote him! He had not suspected his own greatness, nor England's.  The musi=
c ceased. He=20

chanced to look up at the little glooming window, perched out of reach of m=
ankind. And the=20

thought that the window had burned there, patiently and unexpectantly, for =
hundreds of years, like=20

an anchorite above the river and town, somehow disturbed him so that he cou=
ld not continue to=20

look at it. Ineffable sadness of a mere window! And his eye fell--fell on t=
he coffin of Henry Leek=20

with its white cross, and the representative of England's majesty standing =
beside it. And there was=20

the end of Priam Farll's self-control. A pang like a pang of parturition it=
self seized him, and an=20

issuing sob nearly ripped him in two. It was a loud sob, undisguised, unash=
amed, reverberating.=20

Other sobs succeeded it. Priam Farll was in torture.   _A New Hat_   The or=
ganist vaulted over his=20

seat, shocked by the outrage.  "You really mustn't make that noise," whispe=
red the organist.=20

Priam Farll shook him off.  The organist was apparently at a loss what to d=
o.  "Who is it?"=20

whispered one of the young men.  "Don't know him from Adam!" said the organ=
ist with conviction,=20



and then to Priam Farll: "Who are you? You've no right to be here. Who gave=
 you permission to=20

come up here?"  And the rending sobs continued to issue from the full-bodie=
d ridiculous man of=20

fifty, utterly careless of decorum.  "It's perfectly absurd!" whispered the=
 youngster who had=20

whispered before.  There had been a silence in the choir.  "Here! They're w=
aiting for you!"=20

whispered the other young man excitedly to the organist.  "By----!" whisper=
ed the alarmed=20

organist, not stopping to say by what, but leaping like an acrobat back to =
his seat. His fingers and=20

boots were at work instantly, and as he played he turned his head and whisp=
ered--  "Better fetch=20

some one."  One of the young men crept quickly and creakingly down the stai=
rs. Fortunately the=20

organ and choristers were now combined to overcome the sobbing, and they su=
cceeded.=20

Presently a powerful arm, hidden under a black cassock, was laid on Priam's=
 shoulder. He=20

hysterically tried to free himself, but he could not. The cassock and the t=
wo young men thrust him=20

downwards. They all descended together, partly walking and partly falling. =
And then a door was=20

opened, and Priam discovered himself in the unroofed air of the cloisters, =
without his hat, and=20

breathing in gasps. His executioners were also breathing in gasps. They gla=
red at him in=20

triumphant menace, as though they had done something, which indeed they had=
, and as though=20

they meant to do something more but could not quite decide what.  "Where's =
your ticket of=20

admission?" demanded the cassock.  Priam fumbled for it, and could not find=
 it.  "I must have lost=20

it," he said weakly.  "What's your name, anyhow?"  "Priam Farll," said Pria=
m Farll, without thinking.=20

"Off his nut, evidently!" murmured one of the young men contemptuously. "Co=
me on, Stan. Don't=20

let's miss that anthem, for this cuss." And off they both went.  Then a you=
thful policeman=20

appeared, putting on his helmet as he quitted the fane.  "What's all this?"=
 asked the policeman, in=20

the assured tone of one who had the forces of the Empire behind him.  "He's=
 been making a=20

disturbance in the horgan loft," said the cassock, "and now he says his nam=
e's Priam Farll."  "Oh!"=20

said the policeman. "Ho! And how did he get into the organ loft?"  "Don't a=
rsk me," answered the=20

cassock. "He ain't got no ticket."  "Now then, out of it!" said the policem=
an, taking zealously hold of=20

Priam.  "I'll thank you to leave me alone," said Priam, rebelling with all =
the pride of his nature=20

against this clutch of the law.  "Oh, you will, will you?" said the policem=
an. "We'll see about that.=20

We shall just see about that."  And the policeman dragged Priam along the c=
loister to the muffled=20

music of "He will swallow up death in victory." They had not thus proceeded=
 very far when they=20

met another policeman, an older policeman.  "What's all this?" demanded the=
 older policeman.=20

"Drunk and disorderly in the Abbey!" said the younger.  "Will you come quie=
tly?" the older=20

policeman asked Priam, with a touch of commiseration.  "I'm not drunk," sai=
d Priam fiercely; he=20

was unversed in London, and unaware of the foolishness of reasoning with th=
e watch-dogs of=20

justice.  "Will you come quietly?" the older policeman repeated, this time =
without any touch of=20

commiseration.  "Yes," said Priam.  And he went quietly. Experience may tea=
ch with the rapidity of=20

lightning.  "But where's my hat?" he added after a moment, instinctively st=
opping.  "Now then!"=20

said the older policeman. "Come _on_."  He walked between them, striding. J=
ust as they emerged=20

into Dean's Yard, his left hand nervously exploring one of his pockets, on =
a sudden encountered a=20

piece of cardboard.  "Here's my ticket," he said. "I thought I'd lost it. I=
've had nothing at all to drink,=20

and you'd better let me go. The whole affair's a mistake."  The procession =
halted, while the older=20

policeman gazed fascinated at the official document.  "Henry Leek," he read=
, deciphering the=20

name.  "He's been a-telling every one as he's Priam Farll," grumbled the yo=
unger policeman,=20



looking over the other's shoulder.  "I've done no such thing," said Priam p=
romptly.  The elder=20

carefully inspected the prisoner, and two little boys arrived and formed a =
crowd, which was=20

immediately dispersed by a frown.  "He don't look as if he'd had 'ardly as =
much drink as 'ud wash a=20

bus, does he?" murmured the elder critically. The younger, afraid of his se=
nior, said nothing. "Look=20

here, Mr. Henry Leek," the elder proceeded, "do you know what I should do i=
f I was you? I should=20

go and buy myself a new hat, if I was you, and quick too!"  Priam hastened =
away, and heard the=20

senior say to the junior, "He's a toff, that's what he is, and you're a foo=
l. Have you forgotten as=20

you're on point duty?"  And such is the effect of a suggestion given under =
certain circumstances by=20

a man of authority, that Priam Farll went straight along Victoria Street an=
d at Sowter's famous one-

price hat-shop did in fact buy himself a new hat. He then hailed a taximete=
r from the stand=20

opposite the Army and Navy Stores, and curtly gave the address of the Grand=
 Babylon Hotel. And=20

when the cab was fairly at speed, and not before, he abandoned himself to a=
 fit of candid,=20

unrestrained cursing. He cursed largely and variously and shamelessly both =
in English and in=20

French. And he did not cease cursing. It was a reaction which I do not care=
 to characterize; but I=20

will not conceal that it occurred. The fit spent itself before he reached t=
he hotel, for most of=20

Parliament Street was blocked for the spectacular purposes of his funeral, =
and his driver had to=20

seek devious ways. The cursing over, he began to smooth his plumes in detai=
l. At the hotel, out of=20

sheer nervousness, he gave the cabman half-a-crown, which was preposterous.=
  Another cab=20

drove up nearly at the exact instant of his arrival. And, as a capping to t=
he day, Mrs. Alice Challice=20

stepped out of it.         *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER V =
  _Alice on Hotels_   She was=20

wearing the same red roses.  "Oh!" she said, very quickly, pouring out the =
words generously from=20

the inexhaustible mine of her good heart. "I'm so sorry I missed you Saturd=
ay night. I can't tell you=20

how sorry I am. Of course it was all my fault. I oughtn't to have got into =
the lift without you. I ought=20

to have waited. When I was in the lift I wanted to get out, but the lift-ma=
n was too quick for me.=20

And then on the platforms--well, there was such a crowd it was useless! I k=
new it was useless.=20

And you not having my address either! I wondered whatever you would think o=
f me."  "My dear=20

lady!" he protested. "I can assure you I blamed only myself. My hat blew of=
f, and----"  "Did it now!"=20

she took him up breathlessly. "Well, all I want you to understand really is=
 that I'm not one of those=20

silly sort of women that go losing themselves. No. Such a thing's never hap=
pened to me before,=20

and I shall take good care----"  She glanced round. He had paid both the ca=
bmen, who were=20

departing, and he and Mrs. Alice Challice stood under the immense glass por=
tico of the Grand=20

Babylon, exposed to the raking stare of two commissionaires.  "So you _are_=
 staying here!" she=20

said, as if laying hold of a fact which she had hitherto hesitated to touch=
.  "Yes," he said. "Won't=20

you come in?"  He took her into the rich gloom of the Grand Babylon dashing=
ly, fighting against=20

the demon of shyness and beating it off with great loss. They sat down in a=
 corner of the principal=20

foyer, where a few electric lights drew attention to empty fauteuils and th=
e blossoms on the=20

Aubusson carpet. The world was at lunch.  "And a fine time I had getting yo=
ur address!" said she.=20

"Of course I wrote at once to Selwood Terrace, as soon as I got home, but I=
 had the wrong=20

number, somehow, and I kept waiting and waiting for an answer, and the only=
 answer I received=20

was the returned letter. I knew I'd got the street right, and I said, 'I'll=
 find that house if I have to ring=20

every bell in Selwood Terrace, yes', and knock every knocker!' Well, I did =
find it, and then they=20

wouldn't _give_ me your address. They said 'letters would be forwarded,' if=
 you please. But I=20



wasn't going to have any more letter business, no thank you! So I said I wo=
uldn't go without the=20

address. It was Mr. Duncan Farll's clerk that I saw. He's living there for =
the time being. A very nice=20

young man. We got quite friendly. It seems Mr. Duncan Farll _was_ in a stat=
e when he found the=20

will. The young man did say that he broke a typewriter all to pieces. But t=
he funeral being in=20

Westminster Abbey consoled him. It wouldn't have consoled me--no, not it! H=
owever, he's very=20

rich himself, so that doesn't matter. The young man said if I'd call again =
he'd ask his master if he=20

might give me your address. A rare fuss over an address, thought I to mysel=
f. But there! Lawyers!=20

So I called again, and he gave it me. I could have come yesterday. I very n=
early wrote last night.=20

But I thought on the whole I'd better wait till the funeral was over. I tho=
ught it would be nicer. It's=20

over now, I suppose?"  "Yes," said Priam Farll.  She smiled at him with gra=
ve sympathy,=20

comfortably and sensibly. "And right down relieved you must be!" she murmur=
ed. "It must have=20

been very trying for you."  "In a way," he answered hesitatingly, "it was."=
  Taking off her gloves,=20

she glanced round about her, as a thief must glance before opening the door=
, and then, leaning=20

suddenly towards him, she put her hands to his neck and touched his collar.=
 "No, no!" she said.=20

"Let me do it. I can do it. There's no one looking. It's unbuttoned; the ne=
cktie was holding it in=20

place, but it's got quite loose now. There! I can do it. I see you've got t=
wo funny moles on your=20

neck, close together. How lucky! That's it!" A final pat!  Now, no woman ha=
d ever patted Priam=20

Farll's necktie before, much less buttoned his collar, and still much less =
referred to the two little=20

moles, one hirsute, the other hairless, which the collar hid--when it was p=
roperly buttoned! The=20

experience was startling for him in the extreme. It might have made him ver=
y angry, had the hands=20

of Mrs. Challice not been--well, nurse's hands, soft hands, persuasive hand=
s, hands that could=20

practise impossible audacities with impunity. Imagine a woman, uninvited an=
d unpermitted,=20

arranging his collar and necktie for him in the largest public room of the =
Grand Babylon, and then=20

talking about his little moles! It would have been unimaginable! Yet it hap=
pened. And moreover, he=20

had not disliked it. She sat back in her chair as though she had done nothi=
ng in the least degree=20

unusual.  "I can see you must have been very upset," she said gently, "thou=
gh he _has_ only left=20

you a pound a week. Still, that's better than a bat in the eye with a burnt=
 stick."  A bat in the eye=20

with a burnt stick reminded him vaguely of encounters with the police; othe=
rwise it conveyed no=20

meaning to his mind.  "I hope you haven't got to go on duty at once," she s=
aid after a pause.=20

"Because you really do look as if you needed a rest, and a cup of tea or so=
mething of that, I'm=20

quite ashamed to have come bothering you so soon."  "Duty?" he questioned. =
"What duty?"=20

"Why," she exclaimed, "haven't you got a new place?"  "New place!" he repea=
ted after. "What do=20

you mean?"  "Why, as valet."  There was certainly danger in his tendency to=
 forget that he was a=20

valet. He collected himself.  "No," he said, "I haven't got a new place."  =
"Then why are you staying=20

here?" she cried. "I thought you were simply here with a new master, Why ar=
e you staying here=20

alone?"  "Oh," he replied, abashed, "it seemed a convenient place. It was j=
ust by chance that I=20

came here."  "Convenient place indeed!" she said stoutly. "I never heard of=
 such a thing!"  He=20

perceived that he had shocked her, pained her. He saw that some ingenious d=
efence of himself=20

was required; but he could find none. So he said, in his confusion--  "Supp=
ose we go and have=20

something to eat? I do want a bit of lunch, as you say, now I come to think=
 of it. Will you?"  "What?=20

Here?" she demanded apprehensively.  "Yes," he said. "Why not?"  "Well--!" =
 "Come along!" he=20

said, with fine casualness, and conducted her to the eight swinging glass d=
oors that led to the=20



_salle a manger_ of the Grand Babylon. At each pair of doors was a living s=
tatue of dignity in cloth=20

of gold. She passed these statues without a sign of fear, but when she saw =
the room itself,=20

steeped in a supra-genteel calm, full of gowns and hats and everything that=
 you read about in the=20

_Lady's Pictorial,_ and the pennoned mast of a barge crossing the windows a=
t the other end, she=20

stopped suddenly. And one of the lord mayors of the Grand Babylon, wearing =
a mayoral chain,=20

who had started out to meet them, stopped also.  "No!" she said. "I don't f=
eel as if I could eat here.=20

I really couldn't."  "But why?"  "Well," she said, "I couldn't fancy it som=
ehow. Can't we go=20

somewhere else?"  "Certainly we can," he agreed with an eagerness that was =
more than polite.=20

She thanked him with another of her comfortable, sensible smiles--a smile t=
hat took all=20

embarrassment out of the dilemma, as balm will take irritation from a wound=
. And gently she=20

removed her hat and gown, and her gestures and speech, and her comfortablen=
ess, from those=20

august precincts. And they descended to the grill-room, which was relativel=
y noisy, and where her=20

roses were less conspicuous than the helmet of Navarre, and her frock found=
 its sisters and=20

cousins from far lands.  "I'm not much for these restaurants," she said, ov=
er grilled kidneys.  "No?"=20

he responded tentatively. "I'm sorry. I thought the other night----"  "Oh y=
es," she broke in, "I was=20

very glad to go, the other night, to that place, very glad. But, you see, I=
'd never been in a=20

restaurant before."  "Really?"  "No," she said, "and I felt as if I should =
like to try one. And the young=20

lady at the post office had told me that _that_ one was a splendid one. So =
it is. It's beautiful. But of=20

course they ought to be ashamed to offer you such food. Now do you remember=
 that sole? Sole! It=20

was no more sole than this glove's sole. And if it had been cooked a minute=
, it had been cooked=20

an hour, and waiting. And then look at the prices. Oh yes, I couldn't help =
seeing the bill."  "I=20

thought it was awfully cheap," said he.  "Well, _I_ didn't!" said she. "Whe=
n you think that a good=20

housekeeper can keep everything going on ten shillings a head a _week_.... =
Why, it's simply=20

scandalous! And I suppose this place is even dearer?"  He avoided the quest=
ion. "This is a better=20

place altogether," he said. "In=20


_
night, though a man on beat four must have failed in an extraordinary way t=
o see a private=20

crossing his line six feet in front of him.  The muster failed to produce a=
ny rag-eared, stub-tailed,=20

eager-eyed, collarless yellow cub. Nor did the mess-call raise his shrill b=
ark in the vicinity of the=20

cook's tent. The lieutenant felt disappointed.  He thought that the regimen=
t should at least have=20

made some sort of demonstration in Scrap's defense. It seemed a poor return=
 for such confidence=20

and loyalty to be hustled out of the way on an official threat.  It seemed =
to him the regiment was=20

infernally light-hearted, as, pipe-clay white and nickel bright in the morn=
ing sun, it swung out of=20

camp for the parade-ground, where the dog-carts and runabouts and automobil=
es were gathering=20

from Del Monte and the cottages along the shore.  The sight of the twelve c=
ompanies moving=20

across the field with the step of one warmed the cockles of the colonel's p=
ride. The regiment came=20

to parade rest, and the band went swinging past their front, past the revie=
wing-stand. As it=20

wheeled into place, the colonel, who had been speaking to the adjutant, who=
 was the lieutenant of=20

Company A, bit his sentence in the middle, and glared at something that mov=
ed, glittering, at the=20

heels of the drum-major.  The colonel turned bright red. His glass fell out=
 of his eye-socket.  "What=20

the devil is the matter with that dog?" he whispered softly. And the adjuta=
nt, who had also seen=20

and was suffocating, managed to articulate, "Collars!"  The colonel put his=
 glass back in his eye.=20

His shoulders shook. He coughed violently as he addressed the adjutant:  "H=
ave that dog=20

removed--no, let him alone--no, adjutant, bring him here!"  So the adjutant=
, biting his lip, motioned=20

Muldoon to fall out.  Tough old Muldoon tucked Scrap, struggling, squirming=
, glittering like a=20

hardware shop, under his arm, and saluted his commander, while the review w=
aited.  The colonel=20

was blinking through his glass and trying not to grin.  "Sergeant, how many=
 collars has that dog=20

got on?"  "Thirteen, sor," said Muldoon.  "What for?" said the colonel, sev=
erely.  "Wan for each=20

company, sor, an' wan for the band."    A FIRE-FIGHTER'S DOG  By Arthur Qui=
ller-Couch  This is=20

the story of a very distinguished member of the London Fire Brigade--the do=
g Chance. It proves=20

that the fascinations of fires (and who that has witnessed a fire cannot ow=
n this fascination?)=20

extends even to the brute creation. In old Egypt, Herodotus tells us, the c=
ats used on the occasion=20

of a conflagration to rush forth from their burning homes, and then madly a=
ttempt to return again;=20

and the Egyptians, who worshipped the animals, had to form a ring round to =
prevent their dashing=20

past and sacrificing themselves to the flames. This may, however, be due to=
 the cat's notorious=20

love for home. In the case of the dog Chance another hypothesis has to be s=
earched for.  The=20

animal formed his first acquaintance with the brigade by following a firema=
n from a conflagration in=20

Shoreditch to the central station at Watling Street. Here, after he had bee=
n petted for some time by=20

the men, his master came for him and took him home. But the dog quickly esc=
aped and returned=20

to the central station on the very first opportunity. He was carried back, =
returned, was carried back=20

again, and again returned.  At this point his master--"like a mother whose =
son _will_ go to sea"--

abandoned the struggle and allowed him to follow his own course. Henceforth=
 for years he=20

invariably went with the engine, sometimes upon the carriage itself, someti=
mes under the horses'=20

legs; and always, when going uphill, running in advance, and announcing by =
his bark the welcome=20

news that the fire-engine was at hand.  Arrived at the fire, he would amuse=
 himself with pulling=20

burning logs of wood out of the flames with his mouth, firmly impressed tha=
t he was rendering the=20

greatest service, and clearly anxious to show the laymen that he understood=
 all about the=20

business. Although he had his legs broken half a dozen times, he remained f=
aithful to the=20



profession he had so obstinately chosen. At last, having taken a more serio=
us hurt than usual, he=20

was being nursed by the firemen beside the hearth, when a "call" came. At t=
he well-known sound=20

of the engine turning out, the poor old dog made a last effort to climb upo=
n it, and fell back--dead.=20

He was stuffed, and preserved at the station for some time. But even in dea=
th he was destined to=20

prove the friend of the brigade. For, one of the engineers having committed=
 suicide, the firemen=20

determined to raffle him for the benefit of the widow, and such was his fam=
e that he realized 123=20

pounds 10 shillings, 9 pence, or over $615 in American money!    PLATO: THE=
 STORY OF A CAT=20

By A. S. Downs  One day last summer a large handsome black cat walked grave=
ly up one side of=20

Main street, crossed, and went half-way down the other. He stopped at a hou=
se called The Den,=20

went up the piazza steps, and paused by an open window.  A lady sitting ins=
ide saw and spoke to=20

him; but without taking any notice, he put his paws on the sill, looked aro=
und the room as if=20

wondering if it would suit him, and finally gazed into her face.  After thi=
nking a minute he went in,=20

and from that hour took his place as an important member of the family. Civ=
il to all, he gives his=20

love only to the lady whom he first saw; and it is odd to see, as he lies b=
y the fire, how he listens to=20

all conversation, but raises his head only when she speaks, and drops it ag=
ain when she has=20

finished, with a pleased air.  No other person in the house is so wise, for=
 he alone never makes a=20

mistake. The hours he selects for his exercise are the sunniest; the carpet=
s he lies upon the=20

softest, and he knows the moment he enters the room whether his friend will=
 let him lie in her lap,=20

or whether because of her best gown she will have none of him. No one at Th=
e Den can tell how=20

he came to be called Plato. It is a fact that he answers to the name, and w=
hen asked if so known=20

before he came there, smiles wisely. "What matters it," the smile says, "ho=
w I was called, or where=20

I came from, since I am Plato, and am here?"  He dislikes noise, and entire=
ly disapproves=20

sweeping. A broom and dustpan fill him with anxiety, and he seeks the soft =
cushions of the big=20

lounge; but when these in their turn are beaten and tossed about, he retrea=
ts to the study-table.=20

However, as soon as he learned that once a week his favorite room was turne=
d into chaos, he=20

sought another refuge, and refuses to get up that day until noon.  Many wer=
e the speculations as=20

to Plato's Christmas present. All were satisfied with a rattan basket just =
large enough for him to lie=20

in, with a light open canopy, cushions of cardinal chintz, and a cardinal s=
atin bow to which was=20

fastened a lovely card.  It was set down before Plato, and although it is p=
robable it was the first he=20

had ever seen, he showed neither surprise nor curiosity, but looked at it l=
oftily as if such a retreat=20

should have been given him long ago, for could not any discerning person se=
e he was=20

accustomed to luxury? He stepped in carefully and curled himself gracefully=
 upon the soft=20

cushions, the glowing tints of which were very becoming to his sable beauty=
.  It was soon seen=20

that Plato was very fond of his basket, and was unwilling to share it in th=
e smallest degree. When=20

little Bessie put her doll in, "just to see if cardinal was becoming to her=
," he looked so stern and=20

walked so fiercely toward them that dolly's heart sank within her, and Bess=
ie said, "Please excuse=20

us, Plato." If balls and toys were carelessly dropped there he would push t=
hem out without delay,=20

and if visitors took up the basket to examine it, he would fix his eyes upo=
n them, thinking, "O yes,=20

you would pick pockets or steal the spoons if I did not watch you."  As his=
 conduct can never be=20

predicted, great was the curiosity when one cold afternoon he was noticed w=
alking up the avenue=20

while a miserable yellow kitten dragged herself after him. She was so thin =
you could count her=20

bones, and she had been so pulled and kicked that there seemed to be nothin=
g of her but length=20



and--dirt.  When Lord Plato chooses, he enters the front doors, but as he w=
aits no man's pleasure,=20

unless it pleases him first, he has a way of getting in on his own account.=
 Upon one of the shed=20

doors is an old-fashioned latch, which by jumping he can reach and lift wit=
h his paw. Having=20

opened the door, he pushed his poor yellow straggler in and followed himsel=
f. She laid down at=20

once on the floor, and Plato began washing her with his rough tongue, while=
 the lookers-on=20

assisted his hospitality by bringing a saucer of milk. While she ate Plato =
rested, looking as pleased=20

as if he were her mother at her enjoyment. The luncheon finished, the washi=
ng was resumed, and=20

as the waif was now able to help, she soon looked more respectable. But Pla=
to had not finished=20

his work of mercy. He looked at the door leading to the parlor, then at her=
; and finally bent down=20

tenderly to her little torn ears, as if whispering, but she would not move.=
 Perhaps in all her=20

wretched life she had never been so comfortable, and believed in letting we=
ll enough alone.=20

Reason and persuasion alike useless, Plato concluded to try force and, taki=
ng her by the back of=20

the neck, carried her through the house and dropped her close to his dainty=
 cherished basket.=20

Then he appeared a little uncertain what to do. The basket was nice and war=
m; he was tired and=20

cold; it had been a present to him; the street wanderer was dirty still; an=
d the rug would be a softer=20

bed than she had ever known. Were these his thoughts, and was it selfishnes=
s he conquered=20

when at last he lifted the shivering homeless creature into his own beautif=
ul nest?    PETER: A=20

CAT O' ONE TAIL  By Charles Morley  Peter, the admirable cat whose brief hi=
story I am about to=20

relate, appeared in the world on a terrible winter's night. A fierce snowst=
orm was raging, the sleet=20

was driving at a terrific rate through the air, and the streets were banked=
 up with snow-drifts. All=20

traffic had been stopped, the roar of London was hushed, and every one who =
had the merest=20

pretence of a fireside sought it on this memorable occasion. It was a wild =
night in the city, a wild=20

night in the country, a wild night at sea, and certainly a most unpropitiou=
s night for the birth of a=20

cat, an animal which is always associated with home and hearth. The fact re=
mains that Peter was=20

born on the night of one of the most terrible storms on record.  Our chairs=
 were drawn up to the=20

fire, the tea-things were on the table, and my mother was just about to try=
 the strength of the brew,=20

when Ann Tibbits, our faithful and well-tried maid-of-all-work, bounced int=
o the room without=20

knocking at the door. Her cap was all awry, her hair was dishevelled, and s=
he gasped for breath=20

as she addressed herself to my mother thus, in spasms:  "Please--ma'am--the=
 cat has put her=20

kittens--in--your--bonnet!"  Such a breach of discipline had never been kno=
wn before in our prim=20

household, where there was a place for everything, and everything had a pla=
ce.  My mother=20

pushed her spectacles on to her forehead, and, looking severely at Ann, sai=
d: "_Which_ one,=20

Ann? My summer bonnet, or--my winter bonnet?"  "The one with the fur lining=
, ma'am."  "And a=20

most comfortable bonnet to live in, I'm sure!" replied my mother sarcastica=
lly, as much as to say=20

that she wished all cats had such a choice under the circumstances. "Anothe=
r cat would have=20

chosen the one with the lace and the violets, out of sheer perverseness. Bu=
t there--I _knew_ I=20

could depend on a cat which had been trained in _my_ house."  My mother pou=
red out a cup of=20

tea, betraying no agitation as she dropped two lumps of sugar into the cup-=
-her customary=20

allowance--and helped herself to cream. In a minute or two, however, she to=
ok up her knitting, and=20

I noticed that two stitches in succession were dropped, a sure sign that sh=
e was perturbed in spirit.=20

Suddenly my mother turned her eyes to the fire.  "_How many_, Ann?" she con=
tinued, addressing=20

our faithful servant, who still remained standing at the table awaiting her=
 orders.  "Seven, ma'am."=20



"_Seven!_" cried my mother. "Seven--it's outrageous. Why, my bonnet wouldn'=
t hold 'em!"  "Three=20

in the bonnet, ma'am, and two in your new m-u-f-f!"  "My new muff!" cried m=
y mother. "I _knew_=20

you were keeping something back." And the stitches dropped fast and furious=
. "That's only _five_,=20

Ann," she continued, looking up from her work. "Where are the other two? I =
insist upon knowing."=20

"In the Alaska tail boa, ma'am," responded Ann, timidly.  Slowly my mother'=
s wrath evaporated,=20

and her features settled down to their ordinary aspect of composure.  "Well=
," she said, "it might=20

have been worse. She might have put them in my silk dress. But there--it is=
 evident that something=20

must be done. I'm a kind woman, I hope, but I'm not going to be responsible=
 for seven young and=20

tender kittens. Ann Tibbits, England expects every woman to do her duty!"  =
"_All?_ asked Ann.=20

"_Four_," replied my mother.  "Now?" asked Ann.  "The sooner the better," s=
aid my mother.  At=20

this moment a sudden blast shook every window in the house, which seemed to=
 be in momentary=20

danger of a total collapse.  "Not fit to turn a dog out," murmured my mothe=
r. "Not fit to turn a dog=20

out. Ugh! how cold it is, and here am I condemning to death four poor littl=
e kittens on a night like=20

this--to snatch them away from their warm mother, my muff, and Alaska tail,=
 and dip them in a=20

bucket of ice-cold water. And yet they must go; but, Ann, I've an idea--WAR=
M the water. They=20

shall leave the world comfortably. They'll never know it."  The faithful, u=
nemotional Ann carried out=20

her instructions. Peter was one of the three kittens which were born in my =
mother's fur-lined=20

bonnet, and the white marks on his body always remind me of the terrible sn=
owstorm in the midst=20

of which he sounded his first mew.  After several weeks the liberty which o=
ur cat Cordelia had=20

taken with my mother's finery was forgotten, and the household had settled =
down into its usual=20

humdrum routine. Tibbits had made the new arrivals a bed in the little box-=
room, and the doctor=20

declared that Mrs. Cordelia was doing as well as could be expected. Every m=
orning we had asked=20

the usual question: "How is Cordelia?" "Quite well, thank you." "And the ki=
ttens?" "Also quite well."=20

In due course Ann brought the welcome news that the three kittens had opene=
d their eyes, and=20

the kid glove was at once detached from the knocker of the front door. It w=
as on the morning after=20

they had obtained their blessed sight that I was invited by Tibbits to go d=
ownstairs and take my=20

choice. I went down, but I could see nothing of the kittens; there was only=
 Cordelia, with tail=20

twisting, eyes aflame, and whiskers bristling, wheeling round and round a n=
umber of straw cases=20

in which champagne had once been packed. Lo! one of the cases began to walk=
. The movement=20

caught Cordelia's eye, and she knocked it over with her paw. A fluffy, chub=
by kitten, consisting of=20

a black body with a patch of white on it, was revealed. The little one so c=
aptivated my fancy that I=20

put him in my pocket, and without more ado took him upstairs, and publicly =
announced my=20

determination to claim him as my property.  "What shall we name it?" asked =
my mother.  "Fiz,"=20

said one, alluding to the empty champagne cases,--a suggestion which was at=
 once overruled, as=20

we were a temperate family and little given to sparkling liquids. "Pop" was=
 also voted against, not=20

only as being vulgar, but as going to the other extreme, and leading people=
 to suppose that we=20

were extensively addicted to ginger-ale.  "I think, my dears, as Peter was =
born on a--" My mother's=20

speech was interrupted by an exultant "Cock-a-doodle-do."  "That horrid fow=
l again!" exclaimed=20

my mother.  The cock in question was the property of a neighbor, and was a =
most annoying bird.=20

Even my kitten was disturbed by the defiant note. "_M-e-w?_" said he, in a =
meek interrogative, as=20

much as to say, "What _is_ that dreadful noise?"  "Cock-a-doodle-do," cried=
 the bird again.=20

"Mew," replied the kitten, this time with a note of anger in his voice. "CO=
CK-A-DOODLE,"=20



screamed the bird, evidently in a violent temper. "Mew," said the kitten ag=
ain, in a tone of=20

remonstrance. The remaining syllable of his war-cry and the kitten's reply =
were cut short by my=20

mother, who put her fingers to her ears, and said:  "And the cock crowed th=
rice. My dears, I have=20

it!"  "What, mother?"  "We'll call him PETER." cried the family.  "Peter Gr=
ay?"  "Peter Simple?"=20

"Peter the Great?"  "No," replied my mother, with a humorous twinkle, "Pete=
r the Apostle," pointing=20

to the Family Bible, which was always kept on a little occasional table in =
a corner of the sitting-

room. "And let Peter be a living warning against fibbing, my dears, whether=
 on a small scale or a=20

large one."  A bowl of water was then placed on the table and, having sprin=
kled a shower upon his=20

devoted back, I as his proprietor, looking at him closely, cried:  "Arise, =
Peter; obey thy master."  In=20

the middle of my exhortations, however, Cordelia jumped on the table, took =
little Peter by the=20

scruff of his neck, and carried him back to the nursery.  The day came when=
 I put Peter into the=20

pocket of my overcoat, and took him away to his new home. I had the greates=
t confidence in him,=20

being a firm believer in the doctrine of heredity. His father I never knew,=
 but his grandfather bore a=20

great reputation for courage, as was indicated on his tombstone, the inscri=
ption on which ran as=20

follows:     Here lies LEAR. Aged about 8 years. A Tom Cat killed in    sin=
gle combat with Tom the=20

Templar whilst defending his    hearth and home. England expects every cat =
to do his    duty.  His=20

mother Cordelia was of an affectionate nature, caring little for the chase,=
 indifferent to birds=20

(except sparrows), temperate in the matter of fish, timid of dogs, a kind m=
other, and had never=20

been known to scratch a child. I believed then that there was every possibi=
lity of Peter's inheriting=20

the admirable qualities of his relatives. The world into which he was intro=
duced contained a large=20

assortment of curios which I had bought in many a salesroom, such as bits o=
f old oak, bits of=20

armor, bits of china, bits of tapestry, and innumerable odds and ends which=
 had taken my fancy.=20

Picture, then, Peter drinking his milk from a Crown Derby dish which I had =
placed in a corner=20

between the toes of a gentleman skeleton whom Time had stained a tobacco br=
own. The Crown=20

Derby dish and the skeleton were, like the rest of my furniture, "bargains.=
" At this period of his life=20

Peter resembled a series of irregular circles, such as a geometrician might=
 have made in an=20

absent moment: two round eyes, one round head, and one round body. I regard=
ed him much as a=20

young mother would her first baby, for he was my first pet. I watched him l=
est he should get into=20

danger; I conversed with him than one does here."  "Don't you?" she said in=
dulgently, as if saying,=20

"Well, I know one, at any rate."  "They say," he continued, "that there is =
no butter used in this place=20

that costs less than three shillings a pound."  "_No_ butter costs them thr=
ee shillings a pound,"=20

said she.  "Not in London," said he. "They have it from Paris."  "And do yo=
u believe that?" she=20

asked.  "Yes," he said.  "Well, I don't. Any one that pays more than one-an=
d-nine a pound for=20

butter, _at the most_, is a fool, if you'll excuse me saying the word. Not =
but what this is good=20

butter. I couldn't get as good in Putney for less than eighteen pence."  Sh=
e made him feel like a=20

child who has a great deal to pick up from a kindly but firm sister.  "No, =
thank you," she said, a little=20

dryly, to the waiter who proffered a further supply of chip potatoes.  "Now=
 don't say they're cold,"=20

Priam laughed.  And she laughed also. "Shall I tell you one thing that puts=
 me against these=20

restaurants?" she went on. "It's the feeling you have that you don't know w=
here the food's _been_.=20

When you've got your kitchen close to your dining-room and you can keep an =
eye on the stuff from=20

the moment the cart brings it, well, then, you do know a bit where you are.=
 And you can have your=20

dishes served hot. It stands to reason," she said. "Where is the kitchen he=
re?"  "Somewhere down=20



below," he replied apologetically.  "A cellar kitchen!" she exclaimed. "Why=
, in Putney they simply=20

can't let houses with cellar kitchens. No! No restaurants and hotels for me=
--not for _choice_--that=20

is, regularly."  "Still," he said, with a judicial air, "hotels are very co=
nvenient."  "Are they?" she said,=20

meaning, "Prove it."  "For instance, here, there's a telephone in every roo=
m."  "You don't mean in=20

the bedrooms?"  "Yes, in every bedroom."  "Well," she said, "you wouldn't c=
atch me having a=20

telephone in my bedroom. I should never sleep if I knew there was a telepho=
ne in the room! Fancy=20

being forced to telephone every time you want--well! I And how is one to kn=
ow who there is at the=20

other end of the telephone? No, I don't like that. All that's all very well=
 for gentlemen that haven't=20

been used to what I call _com_fort in a way of speaking. But----"  He saw t=
hat if he persisted,=20

nothing soon would be left of that noble pile, the Grand Babylon Hotel, sav=
e a heap of ruins. And,=20

further, she genuinely did cause him to feel that throughout his career he =
had always missed the=20

very best things of life, through being an uncherished, ingenuous, easily s=
atisfied man. A new=20

sensation for him! For if any male in Europe believed in his own capacity t=
o make others make him=20

comfortable Priam Farll was that male.  "I've never been in Putney," he ven=
tured, on a new track.=20

_Difficulty of Truth-telling_   As she informed him, with an ungrudging par=
ticularity, about Putney,=20

and her life at Putney, there gradually arose in his brain a vision of a ki=
nd of existence such as he=20

had never encountered. Putney had clearly the advantages of a residential t=
own in a magnificent=20

situation. It lay on the slope of a hill whose foot was washed by a gloriou=
s stream entitled the=20

Thames, its breast covered with picturesque barges and ornamental rowing bo=
ats; an arched=20

bridge spanned this stream, and you went over the bridge in milk-white omni=
buses to London.=20

Putney had a street of handsome shops, a purely business street; no one sle=
pt there now because=20

of the noise of motors; at eventide the street glittered in its own splendo=
urs. There were theatre,=20

music-hall, assembly-rooms, concert hall, market, brewery, library, and an =
afternoon tea shop=20

exactly like Regent Street (not that Mrs. Challice cared for their alleged =
China tea); also churches=20

and chapels; and Barnes Common if you walked one way, and Wimbledon Common =
if you walked=20

another. Mrs. Challice lived in Werter Road, Werter Road starting convenien=
tly at the corner of the=20

High Street where the fish-shop was--an establishment where authentic sole =
was always=20

obtainable, though it was advisable not to buy it on Monday mornings, of co=
urse. Putney was a=20

place where you lived unvexed, untroubled. You had your little house, and y=
our furniture, and your=20

ability to look after yourself at all ends, and your knowledge of the price=
s of everything, and your=20

deep knowledge of human nature, and your experienced forgivingness towards =
human frailties.=20

You did not keep a servant, because servants were so complicated, and becau=
se they could do=20

nothing whatever as well as you could do it yourself. You had a charwoman w=
hen you felt idle or=20

when you chose to put the house into the back-yard for an airing. With the =
charwoman, a pair of=20

gloves for coarser work, and gas stoves, you 'made naught' of domestic labo=
ur. You were never=20

worried by ambitions, or by envy, or by the desire to know precisely what t=
he wealthy did and to do=20

likewise. You read when you were not more amusingly occupied, preferring il=
lustrated papers and=20

magazines. You did not traffic with art to any appreciable extent, and you =
never dreamed of letting=20

it keep you awake at night. You were rich, for the reason that you spent le=
ss than you received.=20

You never speculated about the ultimate causes of things, or puzzled yourse=
lf concerning the=20

possible developments of society in the next hundred years. When you saw a =
poor old creature in=20

the street you bought a box of matches off the poor old creature. The socia=
l phenomenon which=20



chiefly roused you to just anger was the spectacle of wealthy people making=
 money and so taking=20

the bread out of the mouths of people who needed It. The only apparent blot=
s on existence at=20

Putney were the noise and danger of the High Street, the dearth of reliable=
 laundries, the manners=20

of a middle-aged lady engaged at the post office (Mrs. Challice liked the o=
ther ladies in the post=20

office), and the absence of a suitable man in the house.  Existence at Putn=
ey seemed to Priam=20

Farll to approach the Utopian. It seemed to breathe of romance--the romance=
 of common sense=20

and kindliness and simplicity. It made his own existence to that day appear=
 a futile and unhappy=20

striving after the impossible. Art? What was it? What did it lead to? He wa=
s sick of art, and sick of=20

all the forms of activity to which he had hitherto been accustomed and whic=
h he had mistaken for=20

life itself.  One little home, fixed and stable, rendered foolish the whole=
 concourse of European=20

hotels.  "I suppose you won't be staying here long," demanded Mrs. Challice=
.  "Oh no!" he said. "I=20

shall decide something."  "Shall you take another place?" she inquired.  "A=
nother place?"  "Yes."=20

Her smile was excessively persuasive and inviting.  "I don't know," he said=
 diffidently.  "You must=20

have put a good bit by," she said, still with the same smile. "Or perhaps y=
ou haven't. Saving's a=20

matter of chance. That's what I always do say. It just depends how you begi=
n. It's a habit. I'd never=20

really blame anybody for not saving. And men----!" She seemed to wish to in=
dicate that men were=20

specially to be excused if they did not save.  She had a large mind: that w=
as sure. She=20

understood--things, and human nature in particular. She was not one of thos=
e creatures that a=20

man meets with sometimes--creatures who are for ever on the watch to pounce=
, and who are=20

incapable of making allowances for any male frailty--smooth, smiling creatu=
res, with thin lips, hair=20

a little scanty at the front, and a quietly omniscient 'don't-tell-_me_' to=
ne. Mrs. Alice Challice had a=20

mouth as wide as her ideas, and a full underlip. She was a woman who, as it=
 were, ran out to meet=20

you when you started to cross the dangerous roadway which separates the two=
 sexes. She=20

comprehended because she wanted to comprehend. And when she could not compr=
ehend she=20

would deceive herself that she did: which amounts to the equivalent.  She w=
as a living proof that in=20

her sex social distinctions do not effectively count. Nothing counted where=
 she was concerned,=20

except a distinction far more profound than any social distinction--the his=
toric distinction between=20

Adam and Eve. She was balm to Priam Farll. She might have been equally balm=
 to King David,=20

Uriah the Hittite, Socrates, Rousseau, Lord Byron, Heine, or Charlie Peace.=
 She would have=20

understood them all. They would all have been ready to cushion themselves o=
n her=20

comfortableness. Was she a lady? Pish! She was a woman.  Her temperament dr=
ew Priam Farll=20

like an electrified magnet. To wander about freely in that roomy sympathy o=
f hers seemed to him=20

to be the supreme reward of experience. It seemed like the good inn after t=
he bleak high-road, the=20

oasis after the sandstorm, shade after glare, the dressing after the wound,=
 sleep after insomnia,=20

surcease from unspeakable torture. He wanted, in a word, to tell her everyt=
hing, because she=20

would not demand any difficult explanations. She had given him an opening, =
in her mention of=20

savings. In reply to her suggestion, "You must have put a good bit by," he =
could casually answer:=20

"Yes, a hundred and forty thousand pounds."  And that would lead by natural=
 stages to a complete=20

revealing of the fix in which he was. In five minutes he would have confide=
d to her the principal=20

details, and she would have understood, and then he could describe his agon=
izing and humiliating=20

half-hour in the Abbey, and she would pour her magic oil on that dreadful a=
brasion of his=20

sensitiveness. And he would be healed of his hurts, and they would settle b=
etween them what he=20



ought to do.  He regarded her as his refuge, as fate's generous compensatio=
n to him for the loss=20

of Henry Leek (whose remains now rested in the National Valhalla).  Only, i=
t would be necessary=20

to begin the explanation, so that one thing might by natural stages lead to=
 another. On reflection, it=20

appeared rather abrupt to say:  "Yes, a hundred and forty thousand pounds."=
  The sum was too=20

absurdly high (though correct). The mischief was that, unless the sum did s=
trike her as absurdly=20

high, it could not possibly lead by a natural stage to the remainder of the=
 explanation.  He must=20

contrive another path. For instance--  "There's been a mistake about the so=
-called death of Priam=20

Farll."  "A mistake!" she would exclaim, all ears and eyes.  Then he would =
say--  "Yes. Priam Farll=20

isn't really dead. It's his valet that's dead."  Whereupon she would burst =
out--  "But _you_ were his=20

valet!"  Whereupon he would simply shake his head, and she would steam forw=
ards--  "Then who=20

are you?"  Whereupon he would say, as calmly as he could--  "I'm Priam Farl=
l. I'll tell you precisely=20

how it all happened."  Thus the talk might happen. Thus it would happen, im=
mediately he began.=20

But, as at the Dean's door in Dean's Yard, so now, he could not begin. He c=
ould not utter the=20

necessary words aloud. Spoken aloud, they would sound ridiculous, incredibl=
e, insane--and not=20

even Mrs. Challice could reasonably be expected to grasp their import, much=
 less believe them.=20

"_There's been a mistake about the so-called death of Priam Farll._"  "_Yes=
, a hundred and forty=20

thousand pounds._"  No, he could enunciate neither the one sentence nor the=
 other. There are=20

some truths so bizarre that they make you feel self-conscious and guilty be=
fore you have begun to=20

state them; you state them apologetically; you blush; you stammer; you have=
 all the air of one who=20

does not expect belief; you look a fool; you feel a fool; and you bring dis=
aster on yourself.  He=20

perceived with the most painful clearness that he could never, never impart=
 to her the terrific=20

secret, the awful truth. Great as she was, the truth was greater, and she w=
ould never be able to=20

swallow it.  "What time is it?" she asked suddenly.  "Oh, you mustn't think=
 about time," he said,=20

with hasty concern.   _Results of Rain_   When the lunch was completely fin=
ished and the grill-

room had so far emptied that it was inhabited by no one except themselves a=
nd several waiters=20

who were trying to force them to depart by means of thought transference an=
d uneasy, hovering=20

round their table, Priam Farll began to worry his brains in order to find s=
ome sane way of spending=20

the afternoon in her society. He wanted to keep her, but he did not know ho=
w to keep her. He was=20

quite at a loss. Strange that a man great enough and brilliant enough to ge=
t buried in Westminster=20

Abbey had not sufficient of the small change of cleverness to retain the co=
mpany of a Mrs. Alice=20

Challice! Yet so it was. Happily he was buoyed up by the thought that she u=
nderstood.  "I must be=20

moving off home," she said, putting her gloves on slowly; and sighed.  "Let=
 me see," he=20

stammered. "I think you said Werter Road, Putney?"  "Yes. No. 29."  "Perhap=
s you'll let me call on=20

you," he ventured.  "Oh, do!" she encouraged him.  Nothing could have been =
more correct, and=20

nothing more banal, than this part of their conversation. He certainly woul=
d call. He would travel=20

down to the idyllic Putney to-morrow. He could not lose such a friend, such=
 a balm, such a soft=20

cushion, such a comprehending intelligence. He would bit by bit become inti=
mate with her, and=20

perhaps ultimately he might arrive at the stage of being able to tell her w=
ho he was with some=20

chance of being believed. Anyhow, when he did call--and he insisted to hims=
elf that it should be=20

extremely soon--he would try another plan with her; he would carefully deci=
de beforehand just=20

what to say and how to say it. This decision reconciled him somewhat to a t=
emporary parting from=20

her.  So he paid the bill, under her sagacious, protesting eyes, and he man=
aged to conceal from=20



those eyes the precise amount of the tip; and then, at the cloak-room, he f=
urtively gave sixpence=20

to a fat and wealthy man who had been watching over his hat and stick. (Hig=
hly curious, how=20

those common-sense orbs of hers made all such operations seem excessively s=
illy!) And at last=20

they wandered, in silence, through the corridors and antechambers that led =
to the courtyard=20

entrance. And through the glass portals Priam Farll had a momentary glimpse=
 of the reflection of=20

light on a cabman's wet macintosh. It was raining. It was raining very heav=
ily indeed. All was dry=20

under the glass-roofed colonnades of the courtyard, but the rain rattled li=
ke kettledrums on that=20

glass, and the centre of the courtyard was a pond in which a few hansoms we=
re splashing about.=20

Everything--the horses' coats, the cabmen's hats and capes, and the cabmen'=
s red faces, shone=20

and streamed in the torrential summer rain. It is said that geography makes=
 history. In England,=20

and especially in London, weather makes a good deal of history. Impossible =
to brave that rain,=20

except under the severest pressure of necessity! They were in shelter, and =
in shelter they must=20

remain.  He was glad, absurdly and splendidly glad.  "It can't last long," =
she said, looking up at the=20

black sky, which showed an edge towards the east.  "Suppose we go in again =
and have some=20

tea?" he said.  Now they had barely concluded coffee. But she did not seem =
to mind.  "Well," she=20

said, "it's always tea-time for _me_."  He saw a clock. "It's nearly four,"=
 he said.  Thus justified of=20

the clock, in they went, and sat down in the same seats which they had occu=
pied at the=20

commencement of the adventure in the main lounge. Priam discovered a bell-p=
ush, and=20

commanded China tea and muffins. He felt that he now, as it were, had an op=
portunity of making a=20

fresh start in life. He grew almost gay. He could be gay without sinning ag=
ainst decorum, for Mrs.=20

Challice's singular tact had avoided all reference to deaths and funerals. =
 And in the pause, while=20

he was preparing to be gay, attractive, and in fact his true self, she, cal=
mly stirring China tea, shot=20

a bolt which made him see stars.  "It seems to me," she observed, "that we =
might go farther and=20

fare worse--both of us."  He genuinely did not catch the significance of it=
 in the first instant, and=20

she saw that he did not.  "Oh," she proceeded, benevolently and reassuringl=
y, "I mean it. I'm not=20

gallivanting about. I mean that if you want my opinion I fancy we could mak=
e a match of it."  It was=20

at this point that he saw stars. He also saw a faint and delicious blush on=
 her face, whose=20

complexion was extraordinarily fresh and tender.  She sipped China tea, hol=
ding each finger wide=20

apart from the others.  He had forgotten the origin of their acquaintance, =
forgotten that each of=20

them was supposed to have a definite aim in view, forgotten that it was wit=
h a purpose that they=20

had exchanged photographs. It had not occurred to him that marriage hung ov=
er him like a sword.=20

He perceived the sword now, heavy and sharp, and suspended by a thread of a=
ppalling fragility.=20

He dodged. He did not want to lose her, never to see her again; but he dodg=
ed.  "I couldn't think---

-" he began, and stopped.  "Of course it's a very awkward situation for a m=
an," she went on, toying=20

with muffin. "I can quite understand how you feel. And with most folks you'=
d be right. There's very=20

few women that can judge character, and if you started to try and settle so=
mething at once they'd=20

just set you down as a wrong 'un. But I'm not like that. I don't expect any=
 fiddle-faddle. What I like=20

is plain sense and plain dealing. We both want to get married, so it would =
be silly to pretend we=20

didn't, wouldn't it? And it would be ridiculous of me to look for courting =
and a proposal, and all that=20

sort of thing, just as if I'd never seen a man in his shirt-sleeves. The on=
ly question is: shall we suit=20

each other? I've told you what I think. What do you think?"  She smiled hon=
estly, kindly, but=20

piercingly.  What could he say? What would you have said, you being a man? =
It is easy, sitting=20



there in your chair, with no Mrs. Alice Challice in front of you, to invent=
 diplomatic replies; but=20

conceive yourself in Priam's place! Besides, he did think she would suit hi=
m. And most positively=20

he could not bear the prospect of seeing her pass out of his life. He had b=
een through that=20

experience once, when his hat blew off in the Tube; and he did not wish to =
repeat it.  "Of course=20

you've got no _home_!" she said reflectively, with such compassion. "Suppos=
e you come down=20

and just have a little peep at mine?"  So that evening, a suitably paired c=
ouple chanced into the=20

fishmonger's at the corner of Werter Road, and bought a bit of sole. At the=
 newspaper shop next=20

door but one, placards said: "Impressive Scenes at Westminster Abbey," "Far=
ll funeral, stately=20

pageant," "Great painter laid to rest," etc.         *       *       *     =
  *       *     CHAPTER VI   _A Putney=20

Morning_   Except that there was marrying and giving in marriage, it was ju=
st as though he had=20

died and gone to heaven. Heaven is the absence of worry and of ambition. He=
aven is where you=20

want nothing you haven't got. Heaven is finality. And this was finality. On=
 the September morning,=20

after the honeymoon and the settling down, he arose leisurely, long after h=
is wife, and, putting on=20

the puce dressing-gown (which Alice much admired), he opened the window wid=
er and surveyed=20

that part of the=20


_
a strange jargon, which I called cats' language; I played with him constant=
ly, and introduced him to=20

a black hole behind the skeleton's left heel, which was supposed to be the =
home of mice. He kept=20

a close watch on the black hole, and one day, which is never to be forgotte=
n, he caught his first=20

mouse. It was a very little one, but it clung to Peter's nose and made it b=
leed. Regardless of the=20

pain, Peter marched up to me, tail in air, and laid the half-dead mouse at =
my feet, with a look in his=20

eyes which said plainly enough, "Shades of Caesar! I claim a Triumph, maste=
r."  He returned to=20

the black hole again, and mewed piteously for more. Peter was very green, a=
s you will understand,=20

but he soon discovered that mewing kept the mice away, and having taken the=
 lesson to heart,=20

preserved silence for the future. The mouse-hunts occupied but a small port=
ion of Peter's time. He=20

was full of queer pranks, which youth and high spirits suggested to him. He=
 took a delight in=20

tumbling down the stairs; he hid himself in the mouth of a lion whose head =
was one of my chief=20

treasures; he tilted against a dragon candlestick like a young St. George; =
he burnt his budding=20

whiskers in an attempt to discover the source of the flame in the wick of t=
he candle. He became,=20

too, a great connoisseur of vases, ornaments, and pictures, sitting before =
them and examining=20

them for an hour at a time. He was also very much given to voyages of disco=
very, dark continents=20

having a peculiar fascination for him. Even the lion's mouth had no terror =
for him. I once produced=20

him from the interior of a brand-new top hat like a conjurer an omelette. A=
gain, we were very much=20

surprised at breakfast one morning to see Peter walk out of a rabbit-pie in=
 which he had secreted=20

himself.  I used to let my canary fly about the room, and Peter chased him.=
 The canary flew to an=20

old helmet on a shelf, and thus baffled Peter. The canary seemed to know th=
is, for when Peter=20

was in the room he always flew to the helmet and sang in peace. If he perch=
ed elsewhere there=20

was a chase. The linnet's cage I placed on the window-sill in sunny weather=
, and Peter took great=20

interest in him. He could not see the musician, but he heard the music, and=
 tried every means he=20

knew to discover its source.  At last he peeped through a little hole at th=
e back of the cage, and=20

when he saw the bird he was quite satisfied, and made no attempt to disturb=
 it.  In the matter of=20

eating and drinking Peter was inclined to vegetarianism, being fond of beet=
-root and cabbage, but=20

he soon took to carnal habits, always liking his food to be divided into th=
ree portions, consisting of=20

greens, potatoes, and meat. In addition to such food as we gave him he by n=
o means despised=20

any delicacies he could discover on his own account. For instance he cleane=
d out a pot of=20

glycerine. Having tilted the lid up, he pulled out the pins from a pincushi=
on, but was saved in time;=20

he was curious about a powder-box, and came mewing downstairs a Peter in wh=
ite; he did not=20

despise the birds out of a hat; he lost his temper when he saw his rival in=
 the looking-glass, and=20

was beside himself with rage when the glass swung round and he saw only a p=
lain board. His=20

most curious experience was his first glimpse of the moon, which he saw fro=
m our bit of back=20

garden. He was rooted to the ground with wonder at the amazing sight, and w=
e called him in vain.=20

The only reply was a melancholy, love-stricken mew which went to my heart. =
        *       *       *=20

*       *  So Peter rejoiced in the days of his youth, and there was no end=
 to his frolics. But do not=20

think for a moment that his education was neglected, especially in the inva=
luable matters of=20

manners and deportment, both of which are so essential to advancement in li=
fe. I taught him to sit=20

at table; to enter a room with grace, and to leave it with dignity. Indeed,=
 I spared no trouble, and=20

Peter became as rigorous as a Chesterfield in the proper observance of all =
such matters. I can=20

give you no better example of Peter's extensive knowledge of what was right=
 and wrong in the=20



ceremonial side of life than by telling you that when he felt an irrepressi=
ble sneeze forming he=20

trotted out of the room and sneezed outside. When Peter played, too, he pla=
yed gently, and did=20

not disturb his elders by obtrusive attentions. He never required to be tol=
d twice to do a thing.=20

Once was enough for Peter. Then again in the matter of breakages he was as =
virtuous a kitten as=20

ever lived. I had thirty precious blue china vases on my sideboard, and thr=
ough this fragile maze=20

Peter always wound in and out without moving a vase. His virtues in this re=
spect were well known=20

to my servants, who never accused Peter of breaking the milk-jug, or the cu=
ps and saucers, I can=20

assure you. Like the best of human beings, he had his faults, but upon thes=
e it would be=20

impertinent to touch more than lightly.  Peter was partial to Fridays, beca=
use Fridays were devoted=20

to cleaning up. If you have ever watched a woman washing the kitchen floor,=
 you will have noticed=20

that she completes one patch before she proceeds with the next, as if she t=
ook pride in each=20

patch, regarding it as a picture. It was Peter's delight to sit and watch t=
his domestic operation; and=20

no sooner was the woman's back old woman was coming down the street with a =
great basket of=20

assorted flowers; he took an immense pleasure in the sight of the old woman=
; the sight of the old=20

woman thrilled him. Why? Well, there was no reason, except that she was vig=
orously alive, a part=20

of the magnificent earth. All life gave him joy; all life was beautiful to =
him. He had his warm bath;=20

the bath-room was not of the latest convenience, but Alice could have made =
a four-wheeler=20

convenient. As he passed to and fro on the first-floor he heard the calm, e=
fficient activities below=20

stairs. She was busy in the mornings; her eyes would seem to say to him, "N=
ow, between my=20

uprising and lunch-time please don't depend on me for intellectual or moral=
 support. I am on the=20

spot, but I am also at the wheel and must not be disturbed."  Then he desce=
nded, fresh as a boy,=20

although the promontory which prevented a direct vision of his toes showed =
accretions. The front-

room was a shrine for his breakfast. She served it herself, in her-white ap=
ron, promptly on his=20

arrival! Eggs! Toast! Coffee! It was nothing, that breakfast; and yet it wa=
s everything. No breakfast=20

could have been better. He had probably eaten about fifteen thousand hotel =
breakfasts before=20

Alice taught him what a real breakfast was. After serving it she lingered f=
or a moment, and then=20

handed him the _Daily Telegraph_, which had been lying on a chair.  "Here's=
 your _Telegraph_,"=20

she said cheerfully, tacitly disowning any property or interest in the _Tel=
egraph_. For her,=20

newspapers were men's toys. She never opened a paper, never wanted to know =
what was going=20

on in the world. She was always intent upon her own affairs. Politics--and =
all that business of the=20

mere machinery of living: she perfectly ignored it! She lived. She did noth=
ing but live. She lived=20

every hour. Priam felt truly that he had at last got down to the bed-rock o=
f life.  There were twenty=20

pages of the _Telegraph_, far more matter than a man could read in a day ev=
en if he read and=20

read and neither ate nor slept. And all of it so soothing in its rich varie=
ty! It gently lulled you; it was=20

the ideal companion for a poached egg; upstanding against the coffee-pot, i=
t stood for the solidity=20

of England in the seas. Priam folded it large; he read all the articles dow=
n to the fold; then turned=20

the thing over, and finished all of them. After communing with the _Telegra=
ph_, he communed with=20

his own secret nature, and wandered about, rolling a cigarette. Ah! The fir=
st cigarette! His=20

wanderings led him to the kitchen, or at least as far as the threshold ther=
eof. His wife was at work=20

there. Upon every handle or article that might soil she put soft brown pape=
r, and in addition she=20

often wore house-gloves; so that her hands remained immaculate; thus during=
 the earlier hours of=20

the day the house, especially in the region of fireplaces, had the air of b=
eing in curl-papers.  "I'm=20



going out now, Alice," he said, after he had drawn on his finely polished b=
oots.  "Very well, love,"=20

she replied, preoccupied with her work. "Lunch as usual." She never demande=
d luxuriousness=20

from him. She had got him. She was sure of him. That satisfied her. Sometim=
es, like a simple=20

woman who has come into a set of pearls, she would, as it were, take him ou=
t of his drawer and=20

look at him, and put him back.  At the gate he hesitated whether to turn to=
 the left, towards High=20

Street, or to the right, towards Oxford Road. He chose the right, but he wo=
uld have enjoyed=20

himself equally had he chosen the left. The streets through which he passed=
 were populated by=20

domestic servants and tradesmen's boys. He saw white-capped girls cleaning =
door-knobs or=20

windows, or running along the streets, like escaped nuns, or staring in sof=
t meditation from=20

bedroom windows. And the tradesmen's boys were continually leaping in and o=
ut of carts, or off=20

and on tricycles, busily distributing food and drink, as though Putney had =
been a beleaguered city.=20

It was extremely interesting and mysterious--and what made it the most myst=
erious was that the=20

oligarchy of superior persons for whom these boys and girls so assiduously =
worked, remained=20

invisible. He passed a newspaper shop and found his customary delight in th=
e placards. This=20

morning the _Daily Illustrated_ announced nothing but: "Portrait of a boy a=
ged 12 who weighs 20=20

stone." And the _Record_ whispered in scarlet: "What the German said to the=
 King. Special." The=20

_Journal_ cried: "Surrey's glorious finish." And the _Courier_ shouted: "Th=
e Unwritten Law in the=20

United States. Another Scandal."  Not for gold would he have gone behind th=
ese placards to the=20

organs themselves; he preferred to gather from the placards alone what wond=
ers of yesterday the=20

excellent staid _Telegraph_ had unaccountably missed. But in the _Financial=
 Times_ he saw:=20

"Cohoon's Annual Meeting. Stormy Scenes." And he bought the _Financial Time=
s_ and put it into=20

his pocket for his wife, because she had an interest in Cohoon's Brewery, a=
nd he conceived the=20

possibility of her caring to glance at the report.   _The Simple Joy of Lif=
e_   After crossing the=20

South-Western Railway he got into the Upper Richmond Road, a thoroughfare w=
hich always=20

diverted and amused him. It was such a street of contrasts. Any one could s=
ee that, not many=20

years before, it had=20


_
towards a fresh portion of her territory than Peter ran all over the freshl=
y washed patch and=20

impressed it with the seal of his paws, just as an explorer would indicate =
a great annexation by a=20

series of flags. That was a mere frolic. It was about this time that I disc=
overed Peter's power as a=20

performing cat. I tied a hare's foot to a piece of string and dangled it be=
fore Peter's eyes. I hid the=20

hare's foot in strange places. I flung it downstairs. I threw it upstairs. =
The hare's foot never failed to=20

attract him. We used to roll on the floor together; we played hide-and-seek=
 together. I noticed that=20

he had a habit of lying on his back with his tail out, his head back, and h=
is paws crossed. By=20

degrees I taught him to assume this attitude at the word of command, so tha=
t when I said, "Die,=20

Peter!" Peter turned on his back and became rigid until he received permiss=
ion to live again.  I=20

also taught him to talk in mews at the word of command. I hear some genial =
critic exclaim that this=20

cannot be true. I decline to argue with any critic that ever lived, and rep=
eat, fearlessly, and in=20

measured terms, that Peter talked to _me._ Of course he would not drop into=
 conversation with=20

the first person who bade him "good-morning," but I assert again that Peter=
 and I held many=20

conversations together by means of the "mew," used with a score of inflecti=
ons, often delicately=20

shaded, each of which conveyed its meaning to me.  Peter took to reading, t=
oo, quite easily, and=20

sat up with eye-glasses on his nose and a paper between his paws. It was, a=
s you may well=20

imagine, a red-letter day with me when Peter said his prayers for the first=
 time; and I was better=20

pleased when he put his little paws up and lifted his eyes up to the ceilin=
g than with any other of=20

his accomplishments, though they were more appreciated by unthinking friend=
s. It was all very=20

well to place a mouse at my feet and thus play to the gallery, but I felt t=
hat Peter's thirst for=20

applause might be his ruin.         *       *       *       *       *  When=
 the summer came, and the London=20

pavements began to quake with heat, I determined to fly to the country. As =
delights are doubled=20

when shared with those we care for, I determined to take Peter with me, so =
I packed him up in a=20

specially constructed travelling saloon of his own, to wit, a flannel-lined=
 basket containing all the=20

necessary comforts for the journey, such as air-holes and feeding-bottles, =
and off we started in the=20

highest of spirits. Peter found a new world opened to him, and the thousand=
 and one beauties of=20

the country fascinated us both. We were the guests of a burly farmer, who l=
ived in a queer old=20

house, half timber and half brick, with low-ceilinged rooms. The general li=
ving-room was the=20

capacious kitchen, which looked mighty picturesque. Oak panels ran half-way=
 up to the ceiling; the=20

pots and pans were ranged houses each christened with its own name and each=
 standing in its=20

own garden. And now energetic persons had put churches into it, vast red th=
ings with gigantic=20

bells, and large drapery shops, with blouses at six-and-eleven, and court p=
hotographers, and=20

banks, and cigar-stores, and auctioneers' offices. And all kinds of omnibus=
es ran along it. And yet=20

somehow it remained meditative and superior. In every available space gigan=
tic posters were=20

exhibited. They all had to do with food or pleasure. There were York hams e=
ight feet high, that a=20

regiment could not have eaten in a month; shaggy and ferocious oxen peeping=
 out of monstrous=20

teacups in their anxiety to be consumed; spouting bottles of ale whose frot=
h alone would have=20

floated the mail steamers pictured on an adjoining sheet; and forty differe=
nt decoctions for=20

imparting strength. Then after a few score yards of invitation to debauch t=
here came, with=20

characteristic admirable English common sense, a cure for indigestion, so l=
arge that it would have=20

given ease to a mastodon who had by inadvertence swallowed an elephant. And=
 then there were=20

the calls to pleasure. Astonishing, the quantity of palaces that offered yo=
u exactly the same=20



entertainment twice over on the same night! Astonishing, the reliance on nu=
mber in this matter of=20

amusement! Authenticated statements that a certain performer had done a cer=
tain thing in a=20

certain way a thousand and one times without interruption were stuck all ov=
er the Upper Richmond=20

Road, apparently in the sure hope that you would rush to see the thousand a=
nd second=20

performance. These performances were invariably styled original and novel. =
All the remainder of=20

free wall space was occupied by philanthropists who were ready to give away=
 cigarettes at the=20

nominal price of a penny a packet.  Priam Farll never tired of the phantasm=
agoria of Upper=20

Richmond Road. The interminable, intermittent vision of food dead and alive=
, and of performers=20

performing the same performance from everlasting to everlasting, and of mil=
lions and millions of=20

cigarettes ascending from the mouths of handsome young men in incense to he=
aven--this rare=20

vision, of which in all his wanderings he had never seen the like, had the =
singular effect of lulling=20

his soul into a profound content. Not once did he arrive at the end of the =
vision. No! when he=20

reached Barnes Station he could see the vision still stretching on and on; =
but, filled to the brim, he=20

would get into an omnibus and return. The omnibus awoke him to other issues=
: the omnibus was=20

an antidote. In the omnibus cleanliness was nigh to godliness. On one pane =
a soap was extolled,=20

and on another the exordium, "For this is a true saying and worthy of all a=
cceptation," was=20

followed by the statement of a religious dogma; while on another pane was a=
n urgent appeal not=20

to do in the omnibus what you would not do in a drawing-room.=20


_
an open cupboard, pleasantly suggestive of good fare and plenty of it. Ther=
e were flowers in red=20

pots in the windows, and my bedroom was a picture of coolness and cleanline=
ss.  Amid these=20

pleasant surroundings Peter soon made himself very happy, and became a grea=
t friend of a cat=20

called Jack, who took him under his charge and showed him the ways of the c=
ountry. Jack was a=20

favorite on the farm. He was certainly given to roving, and did not always =
"come home to tea." As=20

a mouser he had few equals in the countryside, and one evening when we were=
 telling stories by=20

the fireside the farmer told me that Jack had despatched no less than four =
hundred mice from one=20

hay-rick.  Jack was a disciple of Isaak Walton. He would crouch on a mossy =
knoll by the edge of=20

the river, and sometimes was successful in capturing a small trout. The far=
mer was himself a great=20

fisherman. Jack was a study while the preparations were in progress, and, a=
ll intent, would follow=20

close at his master's heels. He would crouch among the rushes whilst the ta=
ckle was being=20

adjusted, and anxiously scan the water as the fly drifted along the surface=
. He took a keen delight=20

in the sport, and when a fish was negotiating the bait he always purred lou=
dly in anticipation of the=20

feast in prospect. The trout landed and the line re-cast, he would seize hi=
s prey, and with stealthy=20

gait slink off with his prize, leaving the old farmer to discover his loss =
when he might. Together=20

Jack and Peter roamed over the meadow lands, and the poultry-run was an obj=
ect of great interest=20

to them. Together they fought the rats, and together they would lie in wait=
 for the thrush and the=20

blackbird,--I am happy to say in vain. The farmer told me that in his youth=
 Jack once took up his=20

residence in the hollow of an old oak, where he lived on the furred and fea=
thered game. At last he=20

returned home. For hours he wandered about his old home, fearful of discove=
ry, now crouching=20

amongst the flower-beds, and now flying in terror at the sound of the hall =
clock. At last he ventured=20

into the kitchen, entering by the window and creeping to the kitchen hearth=
, where he dozed off to=20

the music of the cricket, to be welcomed like another Prodigal Son.  Alas! =
these delights were cut=20

short, for Peter and I were soon compelled to pack up our traps and proceed=
 to the seaside for=20

professional purposes. Peter was not fond of the sea. When I took him out y=
achting he was=20

compelled to call for the steward; and one day when exploring the rocks at =
low water, gazing with=20

rapture at his own charming face as it was reflected in the glassy surface =
of a deep pool, an=20

inquiring young lobster nipped his tail, and the shore rang with piteous ca=
lls for help. Peter has=20

never cared for the sea since then, and so deeply was the disaster impresse=
d upon him that I=20

have known him reject a choice bit of meat which happened to have a few gra=
ins of salt on it. It=20

wafted him back to the ocean, the lobster, and the steward. What powers of =
imagination were=20

Peter's!         *       *       *       *       *  As these memoirs cover =
a period of seven or eight years, and=20

as space is limited, my readers will kindly consent to take a seat on the c=
onvenient carpet of the=20

magician, and be wafted gently to the next station on the road without furt=
her question. This is a=20

pleasant byway in suburban London, greatly frequented by organ-grinders, tr=
avelling bears,=20

German bands, and peripatetic white mice. This road is always associated in=
 my mind with the=20

mysterious disappearance of Peter. We had often laughed at the odd old lady=
 who lived two doors=20

higher up, for the anxiety which she displayed when any of her pets were mi=
ssing. It was our turn=20

now.  This same old lady was very fond of her cats, and had nine of them at=
 the time I am writing=20

of. Every morning when the weather was warm, she and her cats would come ou=
t and=20

unconsciously form a succession of tableaux for our amusement. A rug was sp=
read out under the=20

pear tree in the middle of the tiny lawn, a great basket-chair was placed i=
n the middle of this rug,=20



and, these preparations having been made, the old lady, who was very stout,=
 and always wore a=20

monster poke bonnet and a shapeless black silk dress, came out, followed by=
 her nine cats, and=20

took possession of the basket-chair. A little maid then appeared with a tra=
y, on which were nine=20

little blue china saucers and a jug of milk. The nine little saucers were r=
anged in a semicircle, and=20

filled with milk, whereupon the old lady cried out, "Who says breakfast, de=
aries? Who says=20

breakfast--breakfast?" This invitation was immediately responded to by the =
nine cats. When they=20

had done the old lady cried, "Who says washee, dearies? Washee, washee, was=
hee?"=20

Whereupon the nine cats sat on their haunches and proceeded to make their t=
oilettes. The=20

requirements of cleanliness having been satisfied, and the nine basins havi=
ng been taken away by=20

the little maid, the old lady shouted out, "Who says play, dearies? Playee,=
 playee, playee?"=20

holding out her arms, and calling out, "Dido Dums, Dido Dums, come here, de=
ary," when a fine=20

Persian cat jumped on to her right shoulder. "Now Diddles Doddles, Diddles =
Doddles," and=20

another Persian cat jumped on to her left shoulder. "Tootsy Wootsy," she ca=
lled once more, and a=20

black cat scrambled up to the crown of the poke bonnet. And one by one they=
 were summoned by=20

some endearing diminutive, until the nine cats had taken possession of ever=
y possible coign of=20

vantage which was offered by the old lady's capacious person. There they sa=
t, waving their tails to=20

and fro, evidently very pleased by their mistress's little attentions. Mrs.=
 Mee was not very popular=20

in the neighborhood, except with the milkman and the butcher. The cats'-mea=
t-man, indeed, who=20

supplied various families in our road, positively hated her--so I gathered =
from our servant,--and=20

had been heard to say _sotto voce_ in unguarded moments, "Ha! ha! I'll be r=
evenged." It was not=20

unnatural, as the cats were fed on mutton cutlets and fresh milk, and cats'=
 meat was at a discount.=20

About three weeks before Peter disappeared, Mrs. Mee, in the short space of=
 three or four days,=20

had lost no less than five cats by a violent death, and five little graves =
had been dug, marked by=20

five little tombstones, and the five dead cats had been laid in their last =
resting-places by the hands=20

of the old lady herself. A funeral is not generally amusing, but I could no=
t restrain a smile when I=20

saw my eccentric old neighbor follow the remains of her dead pets, which we=
re reverently carried=20

on the tea-tray by the little serving-maid, the old lady herself leading th=
e way, ringing a muffled=20

peal with the dinner-bell, the remaining cats bringing up the rear, ponderi=
ng over the fate of their=20

dead comrades.  It happened that three of these unfortunate victims had bee=
n found on my=20

doorstep. I felt very angry with the old lady, who blamed me for the destru=
ction of her pets,=20

adducing the fact that they were found dying on my doorsteps as proof concl=
usive. One morning I=20

received an anonymous postcard. Although it bore the Charing Cross postmark=
, I felt sure it came=20

from the old lady. It read as follows:     "The Assyrian came down like a w=
olf on the fold."  This was=20

the last straw, for I felt that as regards the old lady's cats I had behave=
d in a sympathetic and=20

neighborly spirit. I remember this post-card because the same afternoon tha=
t it came Peter=20

disappeared, and I began to fear that he had yielded to the temptation of a=
 poisoned pig's foot=20

which had been found in my garden stripped of its flesh. This was a delicac=
y which Peter had=20

never been able to resist, though why he should have preferred it to the ch=
oice foods that were=20

daily piled upon his plate I cannot for the life of me say. We searched the=
 neighborhood in vain,=20

and at last I determined to advertise. Accordingly I addressed an advertise=
ment to my favorite=20

paper. It ran as follows:    "COME BACK, PETER. Lost, stolen, strayed, or p=
oisoned, a white   and=20

black cat called Peter, who left his friends at--on Monday   afternoon last=
. Round his neck he wore=20



a blue ribbon with the word   PETER embroidered upon it in red silk. Before=
 retiring to rest he=20

always says his prayers. Dead or alive, a reward of Two Pounds is   offered=
 to any one who will=20

restore him to his mourning friends."  I little knew what I was bringing on=
 my devoted head. I had=20

been troubled enough before with dying cats, but now they were all alive. C=
ats were brought to me=20

in baskets, in boxes, in arms; Manx cats and cats whose tails were missing =
for other than=20

hereditary reasons; lame cats, blind cats, cats with one eye, and cats who =
squinted. Never before=20

had I seen such an extraordinary collection. My whole time was now taken up=
 in interviewing=20

callers with cats.  If the boys were bad before, they were a thousand times=
 worse now. Here is one=20

example out of a score. He was a boy known as Pop, who carried the laundry =
baskets.  "'Ave yer=20

found yer cat yet?"  "No, we haven't."  "Did yer say it was a yaller 'un?" =
 "No, I didn't."  "What did I=20

say, Hop?" continued Pop, triumphantly turning to a one-legged friend who h=
e had never seen a=20

city so incredibly strange, so packed with curious and rare psychological i=
nterest as London. And=20

he regretted that he had not discovered London earlier in his life-long sea=
rch after romance.  At=20

the corner of the High Street he left the omnibus and stopped a moment to c=
hat with his=20

tobacconist. His tobacconist was a stout man in a white apron, who stood fo=
r ever behind a=20

counter and sold tobacco to the most respected residents of Putney. All his=
 ideas were connected=20

either with tobacco or with Putney. A murder in the Strand to that tobaccon=
ist was less than the=20

breakdown of a motor bus opposite Putney Station; and a change of governmen=
t less than a=20

change of programme at the Putney Empire. A rather pessimistic tobacconist,=
 not inclined to=20

believe in a First Cause, until one day a drunken man smashed Salmon and Gl=
uckstein's window=20

down the High Street, whereupon his opinion of Providence went up for sever=
al days! Priam=20

enjoyed talking to him, though the tobacconist was utterly impervious to id=
eas and never gave out=20

ideas. This morning the tobacconist was at his door. At the other corner wa=
s the sturdy old woman=20

whom Priam had observed from his window. She sold flowers.  "Fine old woman=
, that!" said Priam=20

heartily, after he and the tobacconist had agreed upon the fact that it was=
 a glorious morning.=20

"She used to be at the opposite corner by the station until last May but on=
e, when the police=20

shifted her," said the tobacconist.  "Why did the police shift her?" asked =
Priam.  "I don't know as I=20

can tell you," said the tobacconist. "But I remember her this twelve year."=
  "I only noticed her this=20

morning," said Priam. "I saw her from my bedroom window, coming down the We=
rter Road. I said=20

to myself, 'She's the finest old woman I ever saw in my life!'"  "Did you n=
ow!" murmured the=20

tobacconist. "She's rare and dirty."  "I like her to be dirty," said Priam =
stoutly. "She ought to be=20

dirty. She wouldn't be the same if she were clean."  "I don't hold with dir=
t," said the tobacconist=20

calmly. "She'd be better if she had a bath of a Saturday night like other f=
olks."  "Well," said Priam,=20

"I want an ounce of the usual."  "Thank _you_, sir," said the tobacconist, =
putting down three-

halfpence change out of sixpence as Priam thanked him for the packet.  Noth=
ing whatever in such=20

a dialogue! Yet Priam left the shop with a distinct feeling that life was g=
ood. And he plunged into=20

High Street, lost himself in crowds of perambulators and nice womanly women=
 who were bustling=20

honestly about in search of food or raiment. Many of them carried little re=
d books full of long lists of=20

things which they and their admirers and the offspring of mutual affection =
had eaten or would=20

shortly eat. In the High Street all was luxury: not a necessary in the stre=
et. Even the bakers' shops=20

were a mass of sultana and Berlin pancakes. Illuminated calendars, gramopho=
nes, corsets,=20

picture postcards, Manilla cigars, bridge-scorers, chocolate, exotic fruit,=
 and commodious=20



mansions--these seemed to be the principal objects offered for sale in High=
 Street. Priam bought a=20

sixpenny edition of Herbert Spencer's _Essays_ for four-pence-halfpenny, an=
d passed on to=20

Putney Bridge, whose noble arches divided a first storey of vans and omnibu=
ses from a ground-

floor of barges and racing eights. And he gazed at the broad river and its =
hanging gardens, and=20

dreamed; and was wakened by the roar of an electric train shooting across t=
he stream on a red=20

causeway a few yards below him. And, miles off, he could descry the twin to=
wers of the Crystal=20

Palace, more marvellous than mosques!  "Astounding!" he murmured joyously. =
He had not a care=20

in the world; and Putney was all that Alice had painted it. In due time, wh=
en bells had pealed to=20

right and to left of him, he went home to her.   _Collapse of the Putney Sy=
stem_   Now, just at the=20

end of lunch, over the last stage of which they usually sat a long time, Al=
ice got up quickly, in the=20

midst of her Stilton, and, going to the mantelpiece, took a letter therefro=
m.  "I wish you'd look at=20

that, Henry," she said, handing him the letter. "It came this morning, but =
of course I can't be=20

bothered with that sort of thing in the morning. So I put it aside."  He ac=
cepted the letter, and=20

unfolded it with the professional all-knowing air which even the biggest ma=
le fool will quite=20

successfully put on in the presence of a woman if consulted about business.=
 When he had=20

unfolded the thing--it was typed on stiff, expensive, quarto paper--he read=
 it. In the lives of beings=20

like Priam Farll and Alice a letter such as that letter is a terrible event=
, unique, earth-arresting;=20

simple recipients are apt, on receiving it, to imagine that the Christian e=
ra has come to an end. But=20

tens of thousands of similar letters are sent out from the City every day, =
and the City thinks=20

nothing of them.  The letter was about Cohoon's Brewery Company, Limited, a=
nd it was signed by=20

a firm of solicitors. It referred to the verbatim report, which it said wou=
ld be found in the financial=20

papers, of the annual meeting of the company held at the Cannon Street Hote=
l on the previous=20

day, and to the exceedingly unsatisfactory nature of the Chairman's stateme=
nt. It regretted the=20

absence of Mrs. Alice Challice (her change of condition had not yet reached=
 the heart of=20

Cohoon's) from the meeting, and asked her whether she would be prepared to =
support the action=20

of a committee which had been formed to eject the existing board and which =
had already a=20

following of 385,000 votes. It finished by asserting that unless the commit=
tee was immediately=20

lifted to absolute power the company would be quite ruined.  Priam re-read =
the letter aloud.  "What=20

does it all mean?" asked Alice quietly.  "Well," said he, "that's what it m=
eans."  "Does it mean--?"=20

she began.  "By Jove!" he exclaimed, "I forgot. I saw something on a placar=
d this morning about=20

Cohoon's, and I thought it might interest you, so I bought it." So saying, =
he drew from his pocket=20

the _Financial Times_, which he had entirely forgotten. There it was: a col=
umn and a quarter of the=20

Chairman's speech, and nearly two columns of stormy scenes. The Chairman wa=
s the Marquis of=20

Drumgaldy, but his rank had apparently not shielded him from the violence o=
f expletives such as=20

"Liar!" "Humbug!" and even "Rogue!" The Marquis had merely stated, with eve=
ry formula of=20

apology, that, owing to the extraordinary depreciation in licensed property=
, the directors had not=20

felt justified in declaring any dividend at all on the Ordinary Shares of t=
he company. He had made=20

this quite simple assertion, and instantly a body of shareholders, less rea=
sonable and more=20

avaricious even than shareholders usually are, had begun to turn the histor=
ic hall of the Cannon=20

Street Hotel into a bear garden. One might have imagined that the sole aim =
of brewery companies=20

was to make money, and that the patriotism of old-world brewers, that patri=
otism which impelled=20

them to supply an honest English beer to the honest English working-man at =
a purely nominal=20



price, was scorned and forgotten. One was, indeed, forced to imagine this. =
In vain the Marquis=20

pointed out that the shareholders had received a fifteen per cent, dividend=
 for years and years=20

past, and that really, for once in a way, they ought to be prepared to sacr=
ifice a temporary=20

advantage for the sake of future prosperity. The thought of those regular h=
igh dividends gave rise=20

to no gratitude in shareholding hearts; it seemed merely to render them the=
 more furious. The=20

baser passions had been let loose in the Cannon Street Hotel. The directors=
 had possibly been=20

expecting the baser passions, for a posse of policemen was handy at the doo=
r, and one=20

shareholder, to save him from having the blood of Marquises on his soul, wa=
s ejected. Ultimately,=20

according to the picturesque phrases of the _Financial Times_ report, the m=
eeting broke up in=20

confusion.  "How much have you got in Cohoon's?" Priam asked Alice, after t=
hey had looked=20

through the report together.  "All I have is in Cohoon's," said she, "excep=
t this house. Father left it=20

like that. He always said there was nothing like a brewery. I've heard him =
say many and many a=20

time a brewery was better than consols. I think there's 200 L5 shares. Yes,=
 that's it. But of course=20

they're worth much more than that. They're worth about L12 each. All I know=
 is they bring me in=20

L150 a year as regular as the clock. What's that there, after 'broke up in =
confusion'?"  She pointed=20

with her finger to a paragraph, and he read in a low voice the fluctuations=
 of Cohoon's Ordinary=20

Shares during the afternoon. They had finished at L6 5s. Mrs. Henry Leek ha=
d lost over L1,000 in=20

about half-a-day.  "They've always brought me in L150 a year," she insisted=
, as though she had=20

been saying: "It's always been Christmas Day on the 25th of December, and o=
f course it will be=20

the same this year."  "It doesn't look as if they'd bring you in anything t=
his time," said he.  "Oh, but=20

Henry!" she protested.  Beer had failed! That was the truth of it. Beer had=
 failed. Who would have=20

guessed that beer could fail in England? The wisest, the most prudent men i=
n=20


_
"Yer said, Pop, as it was a tortus," murmured the bashful Hop, who had shel=
tered himself behind=20

Pop.  "A tortus, that's it. A tortus, and Hop and _I's_ found it, sir. We'v=
e got it here."  "You're=20

wrong. My cat's _not_ a tortoise," I replied.  "Bless you, we know that, gu=
v'nor. Just as if we didn't=20

know Peter! Ah! Peter was a cat as wants a lot of replacin', Peter does. Bu=
t me and Hop's got a=20

tortus as is a wunner, guv'nor. A heap better nor Peter. Poor old Peter! he=
's dead and gone. Be=20

sure of that. This 'ere's a reg'lar bad road. A prize-winner, warn't 'e, Ho=
ppy?" They held up the=20

prize-winner, who was _not_ a tortoise, and was mangy.  "Look here, my boys=
, you can take her=20

away. Now, be off. Quick march!"  "Yer don't want it, guv'nor. Jest think a=
gin. Why, 'ow will you get=20

along without a cat? The mice is 'orrible in this 'ere road. Come, guv'nor,=
 I'll tell you what I'll do.=20

You shall 'ave a bargain," said Pop.  I insisted that the tortoise prize-wi=
nner should be taken away,=20

and the next day I stopped the advertisement and resigned myself to despair=
. A week after Peter=20

had disappeared I heard the voice of my grand bulwark of the nation; and ev=
en beer had failed.=20

The foundations of England's greatness were, if not gone, going. Insufficie=
nt to argue bad=20

management, indiscreet purchases of licences at inflated prices! In the exc=
ellent old days a=20

brewery would stand an indefinite amount of bad management! Times were chan=
ged. The British=20

workman, caught in a wave of temperance, could no longer be relied upon to =
drink! It was the=20

crown of his sins against society. Trade unions were nothing to this latest=
 caprice of his, which=20

spread desolation in a thousand genteel homes. Alice wondered what her fath=
er would have said,=20

had he lived. On the whole, she was glad that he did not happen to be alive=
. The shock to him=20

would have been too rude. The floor seemed to be giving way under Alice, me=
lting into a sort of=20

bog that would swallow up her and her husband. For years, without any preci=
se information, but=20

merely by instinct, she had felt that England, beneath the surface, was not=
 quite the island it had=20

been--and here was the awful proof.  She gazed at her husband, as a wife ou=
ght to gaze at her=20

husband in a crisis. His=20


_
friend Pop at the door. "I say, mister, I've some noose. Come along o' me. =
I think I've found 'im.=20

Real. A blue ribbon round 'is neck and says 'is prayers. Put on yer 'at and=
 foller, foller, foller me."=20

Mr. Pop led the way along the road, and turned off to the right, and we wal=
ked up another road=20

until we reached a large house which had been unoccupied for many months. T=
he drains were up,=20

and two or three workmen were busy. Pop at once introduced me as "the gent =
as was lookin' for=20

his cat." "Have you seen a cat with a blue ribbon round his neck?" I asked =
them, very dubious as=20

to the honesty of Pop's intention. "Well, sich a cat _'as_ bin 'ere for som=
e days," replied the=20

workman to whom I had spoken. "He used to come when we were gettin' our bit=
 of dinner. But we=20

never know'd but wot it came from next door. You go upstairs to the first-f=
loor front, and you'll see=20

a sight." On the top of the stairs was Peter, who knew me at once, and bega=
n to purr and rub=20

himself against my legs in a most affectionate manner, as if to appease any=
 outburst of money=20

being always extremely vague.  "Suppose you went up to the City and saw Mr.=
 What's-his-name?"=20

she suggested, meaning the signatory of the letter.  "_Me_!"  It was a cry =
of the soul aghast, a cry=20

drawn out of him sharply, by a most genuine cruel alarm. Him to go up to th=
e City to interview a=20

solicitor! Why, the poor dear woman must be demented! He could not have don=
e it for a million=20

pounds. The thought of it made him sick, raising the whole of his lunch to =
his throat, as by some=20

sinister magic.  She saw and translated the look on his face. It was a look=
 of horror. And at once=20

she made excuses for him to herself. At once she said to herself that it wa=
s no use pretending that=20

her Henry was like other men. He was not. He was a dreamer. He was, at time=
s, amazingly=20

peculiar. But he was her Henry. In any other man than her Henry a hesitatio=
n to take charge of his=20

wife's financial affairs would have been ridiculous; it would have been eff=
eminate. But Henry was=20

Henry. She was gradually learning that truth. He was adorable; but he was H=
enry. With=20


_
Peter into the empty room, which was littered with paper and rubbish, and t=
he remains of forty or=20

fifty mice lay strewn about the floor. Peter looked up to me as if to say: =
"Not a bad bag--eh,=20

master?" In the corner of the room was a bit of sacking which Peter had use=
d as a bed. Pop=20

explained to me that he had heard the men talking about the funny cat that =
came and dined with=20

them every day. This conversation induced him to search the house, with the=
 happy result that=20

Peter was restored to the bosom of his sorrowing family, and Pop gave up th=
e laundry basket, and=20

invested the reward in a small private business of his own.         *      =
 *       *       *       *  Peter and I=20

have had many homes in London and in the country. Together we have lived in=
 flats, in hotels, in=20

farm-houses, and in strength of mind she collected herself.  "No," she said=
 cheerfully. "As they're=20
