the power of moral force, as the convicts far outnumber the honest men; but it may be supposed 

that bolts and bars, and the firearms of the warders, have something to say in the matter. Even 

with these there are occasional attempts at escape or mutiny.  When the war with France came to 

an end the young settlement was likely to lapse into complete decay; but in 1855 it was converted 

into the present convict station. The problem of dealing wisely with crime has not yet been solved; 

and the best that can be said for Princetown is that it is undoubtedly healthy, in spite of its bitter 

cold in winter; and in some sort it may be regarded as a compulsory sanatorium. Whether the 

moral effects are as good as the physical must be left for students of punishment to decide. 

Whether characters are reclaimed or no, there is an effort to reclaim the moor, which is the typical 

stony ground of the parable; and the gradual enclosure of parts that were formerly public is a 

result. But at a step we can pass from present unlovely realities to the remote and traditional.  In 

Fox Tor Mire, precise spot indicated, and was swept into the current, and dragged slowly and 

jerkily across.  Again he made the cast for her, with the same negative result; and then he 

withdrew his hand.  'That's right--very well done!' he said, as she continued.  'Yes, but what's the 

use when you have tried----'  She had scarcely got the words out when she suddenly found the 

line held tight--and tighter--she saw it cut its way through the water, up and towards the bank of 

the pool above--and down and down was the point of the rod pulled until it almost touched the 

stream.  All this had happened in one wild second.  'Let the line go!--what are ye doing, lassie?' he 

cried. The fact was that in her sudden alarm she had grasped both line and rod more firmly than 

ever; and in another half second the fish must inevitably have broken something. But this 

exclamation of his recalled her to her senses--she let the line go free--got up the rod--and then 

waited events--with her heart in her mouth.  She had not long to wait.  It very soon appeared to her 

as if she had hooked an incarnate flash

ugly patches of bog, we come upon the supposed tomb of Childe the Hunter, a kistvaen, while not 

far off is Childe's Cross. The familiar legend tells how Childe of Plymstock was hunting on 

Dartmoor when he was separated from his companions in a snowstorm. He killed his horse and 

crept into its warm carcass lightning; for there was nothing this beast did not attempt to do; now 

rushing down the narrow channel so close to the bank that a single out-jutting twig must have cut 

the line; now lashing on the edge of the shallows; twice jerking himself into the air; and then 

settling down in the deep pool, not to

expedient proved of no avail, though it apparently gave him time to scribble a kind of will on a 

stone, to the effect that--      "Who finds and brings me to my grave     My lands at Plymstock he 

shall have".  Laws regarding the witnessing of wills seem to have had no operation in those days. 

Tidings of his death reaching Tavistock, the monks of the abbey immediately set forth to recover 

the body and so inherit the estate; but it seems that they were nearly forestalled by the of angry 

snaps.  And always it was 'Oh, Ronald, what shall I do now?' or 'Ronald, what will he do next?' 

'You're doing well enough,' said he placidly.  'But it will be a long fight; and ye must not let him too 

far down the stream, or he'll take ye below the foot bridge.  And don't give him much line; follow 

him, rather.'  She was immediately called on to act on this advice; for with one determined, vicious 

rush, away went the salmon down the stream--she after him as well as her
