emerging figure points to the hours, it may make the hours short or long ac=
cording to the=20

respective months.  8. There is also another kind of winter dial, called th=
e Anaphoric and=20

constructed in the following way. The hours, indicated by bronze rods in ac=
cordance with the=20

figure of the analemma, radiate from a centre on the shaking. Here wet hors=
es with drooping=20

heads were standing near their carts, and men were walking about covered wi=
th sacks. It was=20

damp, muddy, and desolate; the water looked cold and malignant. Ivan Ivanov=
itch and Burkin=20

were already conscious of a feeling of wetness, messiness, and discomfort a=
ll over; their feet were=20

heavy=20


_
Behind these rods there is a drum, on which is drawn and painted the firmam=
ent with the circle of=20

the signs. In drawing the figures of the twelve celestial signs, one is rep=
resented larger and the=20

next smaller, proceeding from the centre. Into the back of the drum, in the=
 middle, a revolving axis=20

is inserted, and round that axis is wound a flexible bronze chain, at one e=
nd of which hangs the=20

"cork" which is raised by the water, and at the other a counterpoise of san=
d, equal in weight to the=20

"cork."  9. Hence, the sand sinks as the "cork" is raised by the water, and=
 in sinking turns the axis,=20

and the axis the drum. The revolution of this drum causes sometimes a large=
r and sometimes a=20

smaller portion of the circle of the signs to indicate, during the revoluti=
ons, the proper length of the=20

hours corresponding to their seasons. For in every one of the signs there a=
re as many holes as=20

the corresponding month has days, and a boss, which seems to be holding the=
 representation of=20

the sun on a dial, designates the spaces for the hours. This, as it is carr=
ied from hole to hole,=20

completes the circuit of a full month.  10. Hence, just as the sun during h=
is passage through the=20

constellations makes the days and hours longer or shorter, so the boss on a=
 dial, moving from=20

point to point in a direction contrary to that of the revolution of the dru=
m in the middle, is carried=20

day by day sometimes over wider and sometimes over narrower spaces, giving =
a representation of=20

the hours and days within the limits of each month.  To manage the water so=
 that it may flow=20

regularly, we must proceed as follows.  11. when, crossing the dam, they we=
nt up to the barns,=20

they were silent, as though they were angry with one another.  In one of th=
e barns there was the=20

sound of a winnowing machine, the door was open, and clouds of dust were co=
ming from it. In the=20

doorway was standing Alehin himself, a man of forty, tall and stout, with l=
ong hair, more like a=20

professor or an artist than a landowner. He had on a white shirt that badly=
 needed washing, a rope=20

for a belt, drawers instead of trousers, and his boots, too, were plastered=
 up with mud and straw.=20

His eyes and nose were black with dust. He recognized Ivan Ivanovitch and B=
urkin, and was=20

apparently much delighted to see them.  "Go into the house, gentlemen," he =
said, smiling; "I'll=20

come directly, this minute."  It was a big two-storeyed house. Alehin lived=
 in the lower storey, with=20

arched ceilings and little windows, where the bailiffs had once lived; here=
 everything was plain,=20

and there was a smell of rye bread, cheap vodka, and harness. He went upsta=
irs into the best=20

rooms only on rare occasions, when visitors came. Ivan Ivanovitch and Burki=
n were met in the=20

house by a maid-servant, a young woman so beautiful that they both stood st=
ill and looked at one=20

another.  "You can't imagine how delighted I am to see you, my friends," sa=
id Alehin, going into=20

the hall with them. "It is a surprise! Pelagea," he said, addressing the gi=
rl, "give our visitors=20

something to change into. And, by the way, I will change too. Only I must f=
irst go and wash, for I=20

almost think I have not washed since spring. Wouldn't you like to come into=
 the bath-house? and=20

meanwhile they=20


_
water run down into it through a pipe, and let it have a hole at the bottom=
. Fastened to it is a=20

bronze drum with an opening through which the water flows into it from the =
reservoir. Enclosed in=20

this drum there is a smaller one, the two being perfectly jointed together =
by tenon and socket, in=20

such a way that the smaller drum revolves closely  Beautiful Pelagea, looki=
ng so refined and soft,=20

brought them towels and soap, and Alehin went to the bath-house with his gu=
ests.  "It's a long time=20

since I had a wash," he said, undressing. "I have got a nice bath-house, as=
 you see--my father=20

built it--but I somehow never have time to wash."  He sat down on the steps=
 and soaped his long=20

hair=20

in the larger, like a stopcock.  12. On the lip of the larger drum there ar=
e three hundred and sixty-

five points, marked off at equal intervals. The rim of the smaller one has =
a tongue fixed on its=20

circumference, with the tip directed towards those points; and also in this=
 rim is a small opening,=20

through which water runs into the drum and keeps the works going. The figur=
es of the celestial=20

signs being on the lip of the larger drum, and this drum being motionless, =
let the sign Cancer be=20

drawn at the top, water round him turned brown.  "Yes, I must say," said Iv=
an Ivanovitch=20

meaningly, looking at his head.  "It's a long time since I washed..." said =
Alehin with=20

embarrassment, giving himself a second soaping, and the water near him turn=
ed dark blue, like=20

ink.  Ivan Ivanovitch went outside, plunged into the water with a loud spla=
sh, and swam in the rain,=20

flinging his arms out wide. He stirred the water into waves which set the w=
hite lilies bobbing up=20

and down; he swam to the very middle of the millpond and=20
