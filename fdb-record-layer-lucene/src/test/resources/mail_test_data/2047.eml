easterns, with lovely eyes (for that is the meaning of the words which the English Bible renders "of 

a beautiful countenance"), large and liquid as become a poet. So he stood before the old prophet, 

and with swelling heart and reverent awe received the holy chrism. In silence, as it would seem, 

Samuel anointed him. Whether the secret of his high destiny was imparted to him then, or left to 

be disclosed in future years, is not told. But at all events, whether with full understanding of what 

was before him or no, he must have been conscious of a call that would carry him far away from 

the pastures and olive yards of the little hamlet and of a new Spirit stirring in him from that day 

forward.  This sudden change in all the outlook of his life must have given new materials for 

thought when he went back to his humble task. Responsibility, or the prospect of it, makes lads 

into men very quickly. Graver meditations, humbler consciousness of weakness, a firmer trust in 

God who had laid the burden upon him, would do in days the work of years. And the necessity for 

bidding back the visions of the future in order to do faithfully the obscure duties of the present, 

would add self-control and that they will never read one against her wish which may leave a more 

injurious impression upon their minds than 'Piccadilly.'  [Illustration]     PART V.  THE FLESH. 

PICCADILLY, _June_.  Somebody ought to compile a handbook for _debutants_ and 

_debutantes_, setting forth the most approved modes of procuring invitations to balls and parties 

during the London season. Not only would it be a very invaluable guide now, but it would be 

interesting for posterity to refer to as illustrating the manners and customs of their ancestors, and 

accounting for the hereditary taint of snobbism which is probably destined to characterise in an 

eminent degree the population of the British Isles. "En Angleterre," said a cynical Dutch 

diplomatist, "numero deux va chez numero un, pour s'en glorifier aupres de numero trois." Had he 

gone to the Bodwinkle ball, he would have remarked a curious inversion of his aphorism, for there 

it was _numero un_ who went down to _numero deux_. But I must leave it to Van den Bosch (that, 

I think, was his name) to discover what there was to boast about to number three. He was 

evidently a profound philosopher, but I doubt his getting to the bottom of this great social problem. 

To do so he would have to look at it free from all petty prejudice, recognising its 


_
he matured is singularly shown in the next recorded incident--his summons to the court of Saul, by 

the character of him drawn by the courtier who recommends him to the king. He speaks of David 

in words more suitable to a man of established renown than to a stripling. He is minstrel and 

warrior, "cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man," and "skilled in speech (already well as its 

ridiculous features. Why did Duchesses struggle to be asked to Bodwinkle's? I almost think a new 

phase of snobbism is cropping out, and the rivalry will be to try, not who can rise highest, but who 

can sink lowest, in the social scale. The fashionable world is so _blase_ of itself that it has 

positively become tired of worshipping wealth, unless its owners possess 


_
Lord is with him." (1 Sam. xvi. 18.) So quickly had the new circumstances and the energy of the 

Spirit of God, like tropical sunshine, ripened his soul.  That first visit to the court was but an 

episode in his life, however helpful to his growth it may have been. It would give him the 

knowledge of new scenes, widen his experience, and prepare him for the future. But it cannot 

have been of very long duration. Possibly his harp lost its power over Saul's gloomy spirit, when 

he had become familiar with its notes. For whatever reason, he returned to his father's house, and 

gladly exchanged the favour at court, which might have seemed to a merely ambitious man the 

first step towards fulfilling the prophecy of Samuel's anointing, for the freedom of the pastoral 

solitudes about Bethlehem. There he remained, living to outward seeming as in the quiet days 

before these two great earthquakes in his so vitiated by being unnaturally excited and pandered 

to, that we shall have to invent some new object of ambition. Why, for instance, should not a select 

clique of Oxford Street shopkeepers give a series of parties which might become the rage for one 

season? They have only to get two or three leaders of _ton_ to patronise them at first, and be very 

exclusive and select in their invitations afterwards, to insure success. A year or two ago the thing 

to do was Cremorne; why not have an Oxford Street year? The Bodwinkle tendency will result at 

last in its being the great ambition of a man's life to get his daughters asked to "a little music and a 

few friends" at his bootmaker's.  In Paris, which is becoming rapidly impregnated with this spirit, 

that city being in a very receptive condition for everything bad from all parts of the world--in Paris, I 

say, they have made a very good start, as 


_
thoughts and new power, with broader experience, and a wider horizon, until the hour when he 

was finally wrenched from his seclusion, and flung into the whirlpool of his public career.  There 

are none of David's psalms which can be with any certainty referred to this first period of his life; 

but it has left deep traces on many of them. The allusions to natural scenery and the frequent 

references to varying aspects of the shepherd's life are specimens of these. One characteristic of 

the poetic temperament is the faithful remembrance and cherishing of early days. How fondly he 

recalled them is shown in that most pathetic incident of his longing, as a weary exile, for one 

draught of water from the well at Bethlehem--where in the dear old times he had so often led his 

flocks.  But though we cannot say tea-parties in the Rue de la Paix will readily acknowledge. They 

will bear testimony to the good taste of the milliner, and I to the bad taste of his customers. That 

vain women in the highest circles of Parisian fashion can, in an eager rivalry to display as much of 

their backs as possible, endeavour to obtain the especial patronage of a man-dressmaker, by 

accepting his invitations to tea, should be a warning to you, O gentle English dames! of what you 

may come to. Why sacrifice self-respect and propriety to shoulder-straps? Why insist upon it that 

there is only one man in the world who knows how to cut out a dress behind? Supposing he can 

bring it an inch lower down than anybody else--if you give that inch, beware of the ell. Why, oh 

why, advertise your clothes in the newspapers? Is it not enough to puff 


_
his first exile, there are several which, whatever their date may be, are echoes of his thoughts in 

these first days. This is especially the case in regard to the group which describe varying aspects 

of nature--viz., Psalms xix., viii., xxix. They are unlike his later psalms in the almost entire absence 

of personal references, or of any trace of pressing cares, or of signs of a varied experience of 

human life. In their self-forgetful contemplation dinner-parties in the public journals at so much a 

"notice," without paying 15s. apiece to your dressmaker to put your names into the 'Morning Post,' 

coupled with your wearing apparel, every time you go to Court? If you persist in the practice, let 

me recommend you, as a measure of economy, to put in your own advertisements. The press 

charge is 10s. 6d.; the dressmaker pockets the other 4s. 6d. Or else be generous: why keep the 

whole advertisement
