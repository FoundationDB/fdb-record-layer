skins and rattles eaten up by them.  Shortly after this episode one of our =
helpers in the office found=20

a nest of mice, and, mindful of my hungry snakes, I contrived to catch one =
mouse alive. When the=20

rattlers saw him through their screen, they manifested such a lively intere=

 agility of the crotalus when=20

"Yes," he said.  "I thought it was. I thought it must be. Well, I never kne=

right distance."  "Oh! If=20

you don't _want_ me to see it close," she humoured him. "What a pity you ha=

yes! Yes, I see. But, you=20

perfectly that it had done its work, for in place of "recovering" for anoth=
