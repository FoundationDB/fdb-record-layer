After a time Father Jogues was taken by the Iroquois in one of their tradin=
g visits to the Dutch of New Netherlands, now called New York. This is the =
first time any of the French in Canada had any communication with the Europ=
ean settlers to {68} the south of them, in what are now known as the United=
 States.  The Dutch Governor of Albany took pity on the poor Jesuit priest =
and helped him to _
want our hero relieved him.  But this case did not seem to be like anything=
 Tom had ever met with=20

before.  "Contracting trouble--blasting," repeated the youth, as he mused o=
ver what he had heard.=20

"That's it," the man went on. "Permit me to introduce myself" and he held o=
ut a card, on which was=20

the name  MR. JOB TITUS   Down in the lower left-hand corner was a line:  "=
Titus Brothers,=20

Contractors."  "I am glad to meet you, Mr. Titus," Tom said warmly, offerin=
g his hand. "I don't know=20

anything about the contracting business, but if you do blasting I suppose y=
ou use explosives, and I=20

know a little about them."  "So I have heard, and that's why I came to you,=
" the contractor went on.=20

"Now if you'll give me a few minutes of your time--"  "You had better come =
up to the house,"=20

interrupted Tom.  "We can talk more quietly there."  Calling a young fellow=
 who was at work near=20

by to occupy the gate-house, Tom led Mr. Titus toward the Swift homestead, =
and, a little later,=20

ushered him into the library.  "Now I'll listen to you," the youth said, "t=
hough I can't promise to aid=20

you."  "I realize that," returned Mr. Titus. "This is a sort of last chance=
 I'm taking. My brother and I=20

have heard a lot about you, and when he wrote to me that he was unable to p=
roceed with his=20

contract of tunneling the Andes Mountains for the Peruvian government, I ma=
de up my mind you=20

were the one who could help us if you would."  "Tunneling the Andes Mountai=
ns!" exclaimed Tom.=20

"Yes. The firm represented by my brother and myself have a contract to buil=
d a railroad for the=20

Peruvian government. At a point some distance back in the district east of =
Lima, Peru, we are=20

making a tunnel under the mountain. That is, we have it started, but now we=
 can't advance any=20

further."  "Why not?"  "Because of the peculiar character of the rock, whic=
h seems to defy the=20

strongest explosive we can get. Now I understand you used a powder in your =
giant cannon that--"=20

Mr. Titus paused in his explanation, for at that moment there arose such a =
clatter out on the front=20

piazza as effectually to drown conversation. There was a noise of the hoofs=
 of a horse, the fall of a=20

heavy body, a tattoo on the porch floor and then came an excited shout:  "W=
hoa there! Whoa!=20

Stop! Look out where you're kicking!  Bless my saddle blanket! Ouch! There =
I go!"     Chapter II=20

Explanations   "What in the world is that?" cried Mr. Job Titus, in alarm. =
 Tom Swift did not answer.=20

Instead he jumped up from his chair and ran toward the front door. Mr. Titu=
s followed.  They both=20

saw a strange sight.  Standing on the front porch, which he seemed to occup=
y completely, was a=20

large horse, with a saddle twisted underneath him. The animal was looking a=
bout him as calmly as=20

though he always made it a practice to come up on the front piazza when sto=
pping at a house.  Off=20

to one side, with a crushed hat on the back of his head, with a coat split =
up the back, with a broken=20

riding crop in one hand and a handkerchief in the other, sat a dignified, e=
lderly gentleman.  That is,=20

he would have been dignified had it not been for his position and condition=
. No gentleman can look=20

dignified with a split coat and a crushed hat on, sitting under the nose of=
 a horse on a front piazza,=20

with and almost a little fortress of itself.  For two centuries and a half =
this hospital withstood all the=20

attacks of the Iroquois, until a mighty city pressing in upon it forced it =
to a peaceful surrender to the=20

interests of trade and commerce.  Winter came and went.  Spring found Ville=
 Marie quite snug and=20

comfortable, and the inhabitants wondering where the Iroquois were. They ha=
d not long to wait.  A=20

solitary Algonquin one day fled within the palisades for refuge.  He told M=
aisonneuve that he was=20

being pursued by the Iroquois, coveting his scalp.  In a few hours his purs=
uers had discovered=20

Ville Marie, and, shaking their tomahawks at its inhabitants, vowed vengean=
ce on the bold pale-

faces who had ventured to settle in a part of Canada which they had cruelly=
 decreed should for=20

ever remain a desert.  Thereafter they patrolled the borders of the town, w=
atching stealthily where=20



they might strike down man, woman, or child.  No longer was it possible in =
safety to sow or reap.=20

Nor were the wooden palisades strong enough for protection. Stout walls and=
 bastions were=20

needed, and accordingly stone was quarried across the river, and willing ha=
nds toiled night and=20

day to build what was henceforth little more than a prison.  When the colon=
y was two years old,=20

the Iroquois summoned all their braves.  "Let us destroy these insolent Fre=
nchmen," {66} said their=20

chief; "let us carry off their white girls to drudge for us in our lodges."=
  [Illustration: Maisonneuve=20

covering the Retreat of his Followers, 1644]  Maisonneuve, hearing that the=
y had collected a large=20

force, unwisely sallied out to give them battle.  It was springtime, but th=
e deep snow had not yet=20

melted.  The little company of French settlers, their hearts beating high w=
ith valour and courage,=20

looked about for the foe.  Not finding him at first, they were drawn farthe=
r and farther into the=20

surrounding forest.  Then it was that the redskins, hidden behind trees, da=
rted forth a volley of=20

arrows, and the founders of Ville Marie became an easy target and fell by t=
he dozen. They were=20

unused to this kind of warfare, the only kind the red-men really knew.  Mai=
sonneuve, shocked but=20

undaunted, gave the signal for retreat, and the French drew back to the wal=
ls of Ville Marie,=20

dragging their dead and wounded with them.  Close followed the enemy with e=
ar-splitting yells and=20

flourishing their blood-stained tomahawks.  Maisonneuve, pistol in hand, wa=
s the last man to enter=20

the gate.  Just as he was crossing the threshold an Iroquois chief sprang f=
orward to drag him=20

back, but quick as the savage was, not quick enough was he.  The Governor's=
 pistol rang out, and=20

the chief dropped in his tracks.  His baffled companions, shrieking in ange=
r and dismay, saw the=20

gates of the little town shut, and for that day the rest of its defenders w=
ere safe.  To-day, if you=20

should chance to visit the great city of Montreal, you may see the very spo=
t where this encounter=20

took place.  It is called the Place d'Armes, and in the middle is a bronze =
statue of the brave {67}=20

Maisonneuve, on whose pedestal is a representation of his narrow escape fro=
m death.  Such=20

terrible experiences were not confined to Montreal alone, or even to Quebec=
 and Three Rivers.=20

About the=20


_
scratched and bleeding face with a handkerchief.  "Bless my--bless my--" be=
gan the elderly=20

gentleman, and he seemed at a loss what particular portion of his anatomy o=
r that of the horse, to=20

bless, or what portion of the universe to appeal to, for he ended up with: =
"Bless everything, Tom=20

Swift!"  "I heartily agree with you, Mr. Damon!" cried Tom. "But what in th=
e world happened?"=20

"That!" exclaimed Mr. Damon, pointing with his broken crop at the horse on =
the piazza. "I was=20

riding him when he ran away--just as my motorcycle tried to climb a tree. N=
o more horses for me!=20

I'll stick to airships," and slamming his riding crop down on the porch flo=
or with such Iroquois=20

prowled like wild beasts.  Especially did they frequent the northern outlet=
s of the Ottawa River to=20

waylay the friendly Hurons in their passage to the St. Lawrence, bringing f=
urs for barter to the=20

French.  Observing this, Governor Montmagny set about building a fort at th=
e mouth of the=20

Richelieu River, and notwithstanding the attempts of 700 Iroquois to destro=
y it and kill the=20

workmen, it was completed in a short time and christened Fort Richelieu.  F=
orced to retreat, the=20

savages managed to carry off with them a Jesuit priest, Father Isaac Jogues=
, and two young=20

students named Goupil and Couture, who were coming down the river with a pa=
rty of=20


_
enough if the contortions on his face and his grunts of pain went for anyth=
ing.  "Let me help you!"=20

begged Tom, striding forward. "Mr. Titus, perhaps you will kindly lead the =
horse down off the=20

piazza?"  "Certainly!" answered the tunnel contractor. "Whoa now!" he calle=
d soothingly, as the kill=20

their prisoners at once, as they expected, but, after putting them through =
a course of dreadful=20

tortures, carried them to the home of one of their tribes, the Mohawks.  Af=
ter cutting off Goupil's=20

thumb with a clam-shell, so as to prolong the pain, they scalped him and fl=
ung his body down=20
