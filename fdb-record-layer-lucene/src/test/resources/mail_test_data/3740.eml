agricultural produce and with the need for arms, driven by regional conflicts.  Should the price of 

oil collapse, Russia may again be forced to resort to multilateral financing, a virtual monopoly of 

the long arms of US foreign policy, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The USA also 

has a decisive voice in the World Trade Organization (WTO), membership thereof being a Russian 

strategic goal.  It was the United States which sponsored Russia's seat at table of the G8 - the 

Group of Eight industrialized states - a much coveted reassertion of the Russian Federation's 

global weight. According to Rossiiskaya insubordinate, seized the trading vessels destined for Port 

Royal on one pretext or another, and brought about so many imprisonments and lawsuits, that at 

last Poutraincourt was ruined.  No longer could he send out supplies of provisions, and his people 

at Port Royal had to subsist through a whole winter upon acorns, beech-nuts, and wild roots. 

When Madame de Guercheville and her Jesuit friends had thus crippled poor Poutraincourt, she 

withdrew the priests to other localities named in her charter, over which she really supposed she 

had control.  As for the sturdy old sagamore, Membertou or Chief Henri, he soon

ago that it is considering cutting Russia off American financial aid - probably to remind the former 

empire who is holding the purse strings.  But siding with America risks alienating the all-important 

core of Europe: Germany and France. Europe - especially Germany - is Russia's largest export 

destination and foreign investor. Russia is not oblivious to that. It would like to be compensated 

generously by the United States for assuming such a hazard.  Still, Europe is a captive of 

geography and history. It has few feasible alternatives to Russian gas, for instance. As the recent 

$7 billion investment by British Petroleum proves, Russia - and, by extension, central and east 

Europe - is Europe's growth zone and natural economic hinterland.  Yet, it is America that 

captures the imagination of Russian oligarchs and lesser businesses.  Russia aims to become the 

world's largest oil producer within the decade. With this in mind, it is retooling its infrastructure and 

buried with his forefathers, but of course the priests overcame his scruples, and his wrinkled body 

was laid in the little cemetery at Port Royal.  You may be interested to know what were the French 

Jesuit rights in North-America.  The charter the young king, or rather the Queen Dowager, gave to 

Madame de Guercheville actually included nearly all the territory from the St. Lawrence River to 

Florida.  Was there no one at hand to remind the crafty Marie that the continent she thus 

complacently handed over was not hers or {26} her son's to bestow; that the English had a far 

better right than the French to its possession; that in that very year an English colony had been 

settled in Virginia, chartered by King James the First of England?  Curious to relate, the land which 

the English king granted was as wide in extent, in truth it was almost the very same region as that 

claimed by the French.  So here we have the cause and beginning of a quarrel which occasioned

investing in new pipelines and ports. The United States is aggressively courted by Russian 

officials and "oiligarchs" - the energy tycoons.  With the Gulf states cast in the role of anti-

American Islamic militants, Russia emerges as a sane and safe - i.e., rationally driven by self-

interest - alternative supplier and a useful counterweight to an increasingly assertive and federated 

without interruption, for just a century and a half, between the French and the English colonists in 

North-America.  In the spring of 1613 the Jesuits despatched a new expedition under a courtier 

named La Saussaye, who, having landed at Port Royal to take on board the two priests there, 

sailed on and founded a new colony at Mount Desert, now in the American State of Maine.  They
