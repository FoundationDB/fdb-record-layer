philodendron monstera game--fourteen were piled in front of his right hand and one remained in front of his left hand. He whispered a word to Neil Durant who immediately got to his feet and said:  "Fellows, you have elected a _real_ leader; one who the latent heat on escaping will manifest itself in the form of fire and light, the force with which it strikes the atmosphere, or the rebound of the latter to fill the vacuum, or both, will occasion sound more or less philodendron monstera game--fourteen were piled in front of his right hand and one remained in front of his left hand.

Durant, he saw that these big fellows with whom he had been so closely associated during the 

past few weeks felt, for some miraculous reason, that he had helped them to maintain their spirit 

and to carry the fight to Jefferson.  When it came Teeny-bits' turn, Coach Murray said: "We'll now 

hear from the chap who nearly gave us nervous prostration by forgetting that Ridgley was going to 

play a little game of football to-day."  As Teeny-bits stood up he thought of telling the members of 

the team why he had been late to the game, but he instantly decided that it was better to make his 

explanation alone to Neil Durant or the coach. He merely said:  "I had a pretty good reason for not 

getting to the field before I did,--I am going to tell Mr. Murray and Neil about it later. I haven't much 

to say regarding the game except that I knew we could win because we had the spirit to do it and 

because Neil was showing us the way all the time. To play on the eleven which beat a team that 

fought as hard and as clean as the Jefferson crowd is an honor that makes me dizzy. I began to 

dream about it a few weeks ago; now that it's come true I can hardly believe it."  Teeny-bits sat 

down and a few moments later the balloting began to elect a new captain for the Ridgley team. It 

was Neil Durant's last year and the big leader of the red eleven, before starting the procedure that 

would result in the choosing of his successor, said to his team-mates:  "It is our custom, as you all 

know, to choose a football captain at the dinner following the Jefferson game. It has always been 

done without nominations--simply by balloting. I'll pass around these slips of paper and I want you 

to write on them the name of the man who in your opinion, regardless of friendship, will make the 

leader who will best carry on Ridgley football tradition."  All of the members of the team knew that 

atmosphere opposes less resistance to the sun's rays than in the temperate zones; and in both 

large tracts of cultivated land, the summits and sides of great ranges of mountains, margin of 

oceans, rivers, &c. present an almost naked surface to their influence.[38] The exterior strata of 

the earth, and especially the more exposed parts thereof, envelope in their compounds, elements 

of an identity of character with those composing meteoric stones.  The atmosphere is the great 

recipient of all volatilized bodies; it possesses but feebly the powers of a solvent, unaided by heat 

or moisture, but when these are adjuvants, no body in nature can totally resist their action for a 

long time.  Now if the above principles are admitted, we have in their application a reasonable 

solution of most meteoric phenomena. Thus, the rays of the sun darting through the atmosphere 

reach the surface of the earth, where, by accumulation, they produce sensible heat, which though 

not intense, is steady and uniform, for many hours every day; minute portions of the earthy and 

metallic compounds exposed to the sun's influence, will be volatilized by the absorption of heat, 

and thereby assuming the state of elastic fluids, will ascend until they arrive at media of their own 

density. The atmosphere in contact, will have some of its particles blended in these compounds, 

will ascend with them, and to supply the vacuum, new portions of air will rush in and ascend, and 

the process will continue until the sun's rays are withdrawn, or interrupted by some of the common 

occurrences of nature.  The utmost height to which these elastic fluids ascend, may be estimated 

at something more than one hundred miles; and they float at every intermediate distance between 

their greatest elevation and the clouds, but rarely below the latter, except their course is directed 

towards the earth in

they took it solemnly and in silence. There were no suggestions passed from one to another; each 

received a paper from the captain, wrote down a name and returned the folded slip to Neil, who 

made a second round of the big table. The captain turned the ballots over to the coach who 

quickly unfolded and counted them. When he was through, of the fifteen ascend at first in small 

daily detached portions of gaseous clouds, and are diffused over wide regions; but having no 

sensible resistance opposed to their mutual attraction, they will by the laws of their affinities 

congregate into immense volumes of highly concentrated elastic fluids, which on exploding will 

exhibit all the phenomena of bursting meteors in the
