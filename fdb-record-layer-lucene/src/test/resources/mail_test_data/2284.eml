but they are sufficiently amusing for all that.=E2=80=9D  Early in the day =
Ivan had observed the words, =E2=80=9CIci on=20

dine =C3=A0 la Russe,=E2=80=9D on the window of a fashionable restaurant in=
 the Rue St. Honor=C3=A9. He took Emile=20

privately into counsel, saying, =E2=80=9CI should like to give our friends =
a genuine Russian dinner;=E2=80=9D and the=20

lad, notwithstanding his private feelings, was glad to assist in a plan tha=
t promised a little=20

amusement to himself. Accordingly, when the day was nearing its close, and =
the eyes and limbs of=20

the little party were thoroughly tired, no one was very sorry to hear Emile=
 say to Ivan,--  =E2=80=9CThis is the=20

place where you wished me to order dinner, Monsieur Posharky. I have carrie=
d out all your=20

directions to the best of my ability.=E2=80=9D  But ere they could enter th=
e glittering doors of the restaurant,=20

their attention was attracted by a little scene which was passing on the cr=
owded footpath of the=20

fashionable street. A gentleman whom Emile would have called old, Ivan midd=
le-aged, and=20

Madame de Talmont in the prime of life, was bending in evident perplexity o=
ver a little girl, who=20

was crying and stamping her small foot in a vehement passion.  =E2=80=9CMa =
petite, ma ch=C3=A8re fillette,=E2=80=9D he=20

was expostulating, =E2=80=9Cbe wise, I pray thee. Bethink thyself; all the =
world is gazing at us. Come,=20

come, my child, dry thine eyes. I will buy thee a far handsomer brooch at t=
he first jeweller=E2=80=99s shop I=20

can find.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut it will not have in it the hair of dear ma=
mma,=E2=80=9D sobbed the child, a slight, black-eyed=20

little girl of eleven or twelve.  Meanwhile Madame de Talmont recognized in=
 the gentleman an old=20

friend, a political exile, who had doubtless accompanied the stream of retu=
rning _=C3=A9migr=C3=A9s_ back to=20

Paris.  =E2=80=9CCan it be that I have the happiness of seeing once again m=
y dear old friend Monsieur de=20

Sartines?=E2=80=9D she interposed, making a most welcome diversion; =E2=80=
=9Cand this--is this young lady the little=20

St=C3=A9phanie we used to know, whom I have so often held in my arms? Monsi=
eur de Sartines, here is=20

my daughter Cl=C3=A9mence,=E2=80=9D she added. =E2=80=9CShe too will have g=
rown almost beyond your remembrance.=E2=80=9D=20

But Cl=C3=A9mence was already making friends with the disconsolate St=C3=A9=
phanie, listening to the story of=20

the lost brooch, and comforting her with a tact and gentleness which Ivan w=
as watching with=20

admiring and delighted eyes.  Madame de Talmont soon remembered him, and pr=
esented to M.=20

de Sartines =E2=80=9COur young friend Monsieur Pojarsky, a Russian, an offi=
cer in his Imperial Majesty=E2=80=99s=20

Chevalier Guard.=E2=80=9D  After the usual compliments, Ivan presented a re=
quest, framed as gracefully as=20

a Parisian could have done it, that monsieur and mademoiselle would do him =
the honour to join=20

them at dinner. The proposal was found agreeable, and the whole party adjou=
rned to a handsome=20

dining-hall, where a table exquisitely adorned with baskets of rare fruit a=
nd vases of flowers fully=20

satisfied Ivan=E2=80=99s expectations. Nor did the repast that followed dis=
appoint the young Russian,=20

jealous in the lightest matters for the credit of his country. The enterpri=
sing Parisian restaurateur,=20

having secured the services of a celebrated French _chef de cuisine_ whom t=
he war had deprived=20

of his lucrative situation in the establishment of a Russian millionnaire, =
was able to set before his=20

numerous Russian guests just such a banquet as would have awaited them at t=
he table of a=20

Tolstoi, a Narischkin, a Dolgorouki.  The dinner went merrily forward. The =
names of the dishes=20

were strange, but their quality was unexceptionable. Amongst other specialt=
ies, a delicate fish=20

soup gained the approbation of the party, although Ivan lamented that it co=
uld only be made in=20

perfection of the sterlet, not to be found anywhere except in the waters of=
 the Oka, the river near=20

which he had spent his childhood. Emile devoted himself assiduously to cert=
ain delicious chicken=20

cutlets called =E2=80=9CC=C3=B4telettes =C3=A0 la Pojarsky=E2=80=9D in hono=
ur of Ivan=E2=80=99s heroic ancestor; although, when he=20

heard the name, he somewhat ungallantly sought to dissuade Cl=C3=A9mence fr=
om partaking of them.=20
