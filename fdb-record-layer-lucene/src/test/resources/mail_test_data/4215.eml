=E2=80=9CShe once used to be very kind to me, but she philodendron monstera=
 in a soft state, after which it hardens to the tightness of a drum when th=
oroughly dry. No bed is more comfortable for a warm climate than a native a=
ngarep with a simple mat covering; are other things which are not without v=
exation=E2=80=94at least to mamma.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI do not think I am a=
 great favorite of your mamma,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CShe once use=
d to be very kind to me, but she _
cause an haemorrhage sufficient to insure the death of the elephant within =
about an hour. On time=20

other hand, should the animal be awake upon their arrival, it would be impo=
ssible to approach the=20

trunk; in such a case, they would creep up from behind, and give a tremendo=
us cut at the back=20

sinew of the hind leg, about a foot above the heel. Such a blow would disab=
le the elephant at=20

once, and would render comparatively easy a second cut to the remaining leg=
; the arteries being=20

divided, the animal would quickly bleed to death. These were the methods ad=
opted by poor=20

hunters, until, by the sale of ivory, they could purchase horses for the hi=
gher branch of the art.=20

Provided with horses, the party of hunters should not exceed four. They sta=
rt before daybreak, and=20

ride slowly throughout the country in search of elephants, generally keepin=
g along the course of a=20

river until they come upon the tracks where a herd or a single elephant may=
 have drunk during the=20

night. When once upon the tracks, they follow fast towards the retreating g=
ame. The elephants=20

may be twenty miles distant; but it matters little to the aggageers. At len=
gth they discover them,=20

and the hunt begins. The first step is to single out the bull with the larg=
est tusks; this is the=20

commencement of the fight. After a short hunt, the elephant turns upon his =
pursuers, who scatter=20

and fly from his headlong charge until he gives up the pursuit; he at lengt=
h turns to bay when=20

again pressed by the hunters. It is the duty of one man in particular to ri=
de up close to the head of=20

the elephant, and thus to absorb its attention upon himself. This insures a=
 desperate charge. The=20

greatest coolness and dexterity are then required by the hunter, who now, t=
he HUNTED, must so=20

adapt the speed of his horse to the pace of the elephant, that the enraged =
beast gains in the race=20

until it almost reaches the tail of the horse. In this manner the race cont=
inues. In the meantime,=20

two hunters gallop up behind the elephant, unseen by the animal, whose atte=
ntion is completely=20

directed to the horse almost within his grasp. With extreme agility, when c=
lose to the heels of the=20

elephant, one of the hunters, while at full speed, springs to the ground wi=
th his drawn sword, as=20

his companion seizes the bridle, and with one dexterous two-handed blow he =
severs the back=20

sinew. He immediately jumps out of the way and remounts his horse; but if t=
he blow is successful,=20

the elephant becomes disabled by the first pressure of its foot upon the gr=
ound; the enormous=20

weight of the animal dislocates the joint, and it is rendered helpless. The=
 hunter who has hitherto=20

led the elephant immediately turns, and riding to within a few feet of the =
trunk, he induces the=20

animal to attempt another charge. This, clumsily made, affords an easy oppo=
rtunity for the=20

aggageers behind to slash the sinew of the remaining leg, and the immense b=
rute is reduced to a=20

standstill; it dies of loss of blood in a short time, THUS POSITIVELY KILLE=
D BY ONE MAN WITH=20

TWO STROKES OF THE SWORD!  This extraordinary hunting is attended with supe=
rlative=20

danger, and the hunters frequently fall victims to their intrepidity. I fel=
t inclined to take off my cap=20

and make a low bow to the gallant and swarthy fellows who sat before me, wh=
en I knew the=20

toughness of their hearts and the activity of their limbs. One of them was =
disabled for life by a cut=20

from his own sword, that had severed the knee-cap and bitten deep into the =
joint, leaving a scar=20

that appeared as though the leg had been nearly off; he had missed his blow=
 at the elephant,=20

owing to the high and tough dried grass that had partially stopped the swor=
d, and in springing=20

upon one side, to avoid the animal that had turned upon him, he fell over h=
is own sharp blade,=20

which cut through the bone, and he lay helpless; he was saved by one of his=
 comrades, who=20

immediately rushed in from behind, and with a desperate cut severed the bac=
k sinew of the=20

elephant. As I listened to these fine fellows, who in a modest and unassumi=
ng manner recounted=20



their adventures as matters of course, I felt exceedingly small. My whole l=
ife had been passed in=20

wild sports from early manhood, and I had imagined that I understood as muc=
h as most people of=20

this subject; but here were men who, without the aid of the best rifles and=
 deadly projectiles, went=20

straight at their game, and faced the lion in his den with shield and sabre=
. There is a freemasonry=20

among hunters, and my heart was drawn towards these aggageers. We fraternis=
ed upon the spot,=20

and I looked forward with intense pleasure to the day when we might become =
allies in action.  I=20

have been rewarded by this alliance in being now able to speak of the deeds=
 of others that far=20

excel my own, and of bearing testimony to the wonderful courage and dexteri=
ty of these Nimrods,=20

instead of continually relating anecdotes of dangers in the first person, w=
hich cannot be more=20

disagreeable to the reader than to the narrator.  Without inflicting a desc=
ription of five months=20

passed in Sofi, it will be necessary to make a few extracts from my journal=
, to convey an idea of=20

the manner in which the time was occupied.  "August 7, 1861.--There is plen=
ty of game on the=20

other side of the river, but nothing upon this; there are no means of cross=
ing, as the stream is=20

exceedingly strong, and about two hundred yards in width. We felled a tree =
for a canoe, but there=20

is nothing worthy of the name of timber, and the wood is extremely heavy.  =
"There are several=20

varieties of wild spinach, and a plant that makes a good salad, known by th=
e Arabs as 'Regly;' also=20

wild onions as large as a man's fist, but uneatable.  "Angust 8.--I counted=
 seventy-six giraffes on=20

the opposite side of the river. This magnificent sight is most tantalizing.=
 The sheik made his=20

appearance to-day with a present of butter and honey, and some small money =
in exchange for=20

dollars that I had given him. The Austrian dollar of Maria Theresa is the o=
nly large coin current in=20

this country; the effigy of the empress, with a very low dress and a profus=
ion of bust, is, I believe,=20

the charm that suits the Arab taste. So particular are these people, that t=
hey reject the coin after=20

careful examination, unless they can distinctly count seven dots that form =
the star upon the=20

coronet. No clean money will pass current in this country; all coins must b=
e dirty and gummy,=20

otherwise they are rejected: this may be accounted for, as the Arabs have n=
o method of detecting=20

false money; thus they are afraid to accept any new coin.  "Auqust 16.--Gre=
at failure! We launched=20

the canoe, but although it was carefully hollowed out, the wood was so heav=
y that it would only=20

carry one person, and even then it threatened to become a bathing-machine; =
thus nine days' hard=20

work are lost. Florian is in despair, but 'Nil desperandum!' I shall set to=
 work instanter, and make a=20

raft. Counted twenty-eight giraffes on the opposite side of the river.  "Au=
gust 17.--I set to work at=20

daybreak to make a raft of bamboo and inflated skins. There is a wood calle=
d ambatch (Anemone=20

mirabilis) that is brought down by the river from the upper country; this i=
s lighter than cork, and I=20

have obtained four large pieces for my raft. Mahomet has been very saucy to=
-day; he has been=20

offensively impertinent for a long time, so this morning I punched his head=
.  "August 18.--

Launched the raft; it carries four persons safely; but the current is too s=
trong, and it is therefore=20

unmanageable. In the afternoon I shot a large crocodile on the other side o=
f the river (about two=20

hundred yards) with the little Fletcher rifle, and after struggling for som=
e time upon the steep bank=20

it rolled into the water.  "The large tamarind trees on the opposite bank a=
re generally full of the=20

dog-faced baboons (Cynocephalus) in the evening, at their drinking-hour. I =
watched a large=20

crocodile creep slyly out of the water, and lie in waiting among the rocks =
at the usual drinking-

place before they arrived, but the baboons were too wide awake to be taken =
in so easily. A young=20

fellow was the first to discover the enemy; he had accompanied several wise=
 and experienced old=20



hands, to the extremity of the bough that at a considerable height overhung=
 the river; from this=20

post they had a bird's-eye view, and reconnoitred before one of the numerou=
s party descended to=20

drink. The sharp eyes of the young one at once detected the crocodile, who =
matched in colour so=20

well with the rocks, that most probably a man would not have noticed it unt=
il too late. At once the=20

young one commenced shaking the bough and screaming with all his might to a=
ttract the attention=20

of the crocodile, and to induce it to move. In this he was immediately join=
ed by the whole party,=20

who yelled in chorus, while the large old males bellowed defiance, and desc=
ended to the lowest=20

branches within eight or ten feet of the crocodile. It was of no use--the p=
retender never stirred, and=20

I watched it until dark; it remained still inn the same place, waiting for =
some unfortunate baboon=20

whose thirst might provoke his fate; but not one was sufficiently foolish, =
although the perpendicular=20

banks prevented them from drinking except at that particular spot.  "The bi=
rds in this country moult=20

twice during the year, and those of the most brilliant colours exchange the=
ir gaudy hues for a=20

sober grey or brown. Several varieties sing beautifully; the swallow also s=
ings, although in Europe=20

I have never heard it attempt more than its well-known twitter.  "One of th=
e mimosas yields an=20

excellent fibre for rope-making, in which my people are busily engaged; the=
 bark is as tough as=20

leather, and forms an admirable material for the manufacture of sacks. This=
 business is carried to=20

a considerable extent by the Arabs, as there is a large demand for sacks of=
 sufficient size to=20

contain two hundred and fifty or three hundred pounds of gum arabic (half a=
 camel load). Thus one=20

sack slung upon each side can be packed easily to the animal.  "August 19.-=
-A dead elephant=20

floated down the river to-day: this is the second that has passed within th=
e last few days; they=20

have been most probably drowned in attempting to cross some powerful torren=
t tributary to the=20

Atbara. As usual, upon the fact becoming known, the entire village rushed o=
ut, and, despite the=20

crocodiles, a crowd of men plunged into the river about a quarter of a mile=
 below Sofi, and=20

swimming out they intercepted the swollen carcase, which was quickly covere=
d with people; they=20

were carried several miles down the river before they could tow the body to=
 shore, by ropes=20

fastened to the swimmers. Afterwards, there was a general quarrel over the =
division of the spoil:=20

the skin, in sections, and the tusks, were brought home in triumph.  "The c=
ountry being now bright=20

green, the antelopes are distinctly visible on the opposite side. Three tet=
el (Antelopus Bubalis)=20

graze regularly together in the same place daily. This antelope is a variet=
y of the hartebeest of=20

South Africa; it is a reddish-chestnut colour, and is about the size of an =
Alderney cow.  "One of the=20

mimosas (Acacia Arabica) produces a fruit in appearance resembling a tamari=
nd: this is a powerful=20

astringent and a valuable medicine in cases of fever and diarrhoea; it is g=
enerally used by the=20

Arabs for preparing hides; when dry and broken it is rich in a hard gum, wh=
ich appears to be=20

almost pure tannin.  "August 20.--Close, hot, and damp weather; violent rai=
n about sixteen hours=20

out of the twenty-four. When the hot season sets in, the country will almos=
t boil. This morning I=20

counted 154 giraffes in one herd on the other side of the river; there were=
 many more, but they=20

passed each other so rapidly that I could not reckon the obstacle to intima=
cy, and the domestic=20

embarrassments occasioned by Bertram=E2=80=99s declaration, he had become a=
 stranger to a roof which=20

had so filled his thoughts. It seemed to him that he could not enter the ho=
use either as the admirer=20

of the daughter or as the friend of her brother. She was probably engaged t=
o another, and, as=20

Bertram=E2=80=99s friend and fellow-traveller, he fancied he was looked upo=
n by the family as one who had=20

in some degree contributed to their mortification. Much of this was imagina=
ry, but Lothair was very=20



sensitive, and the result was that he ceased to call at Crecy House, and fo=
r some time, kept aloof=20

from the duchess and her daughter, when he met them in general society. He =
was glad to hear=20

from Bertram and St. Aldegonde that the position of the former was beginnin=
g to soften at home,=20

and that the sharpness of his announcement was passing away. And, when he h=
ad clearly=20

ascertained that the contemplated union of Lady Corisande with the duke was=
 certainly not to take=20

place, Lothair began to reconnoitre, and try to resume his original positio=
n. But his reception was=20

not encouraging, at least not sufficiently cordial for one who by nature wa=
s retiring and reserved.=20

Lady Corisande was always kind, and after some time he danced with her agai=
n. But there were=20

no invitations to luncheon from the duchess; they never asked him to dinner=
. His approaches were=20

received with courtesy, but he was not courted.  The announcement of the ma=
rriage of the Duke of=20

Brecon did not, apparently, in any degree, distress Lady Corisande. On the =
contrary, she=20

expressed much satisfaction at her two young friends settling in life with =
such success and=20

splendor. The ambition both of Lady Flora and Lady Grizell was that Corisan=
de should be a=20

bridesmaid. This would be a rather awkward post to occupy under the circums=
tances, so she=20

embraced both, and said that she loved them both so equally, that she would=
 not give a=20

preference to either, and therefore, though she certainly would attend thei=
r wedding, she would=20

refrain from taking part in the ceremony.  The duchess went with Lady Coris=
ande one morning to=20

Mr. Ruby=E2=80=99s to choose a present from her daughter to each of the you=
ng ladies. Mr. Ruby in a back=20

shop poured forth his treasures of bracelets, and rings, and lockets. The p=
resents must be similar=20

in value and in beauty, and yet there must be some difference between them;=
 so it was a rather=20

long and troublesome investigation, Mr. Ruby, as usual, varying its monoton=
y, or mitigating its=20

wearisomeness, by occasionally, or suddenly, exhibiting some splendid or st=
artling production of=20

his art. The parure of an empress, the bracelets of grand-duchesses, a wond=
erful fan that was to=20

flutter in the hands of majesty, had all in due course appeared, as well as=
 the black pearls and=20

yellow diamonds that figure and flash on such occasions, before eyes so fav=
ored and so fair.  At=20

last=E2=80=94for, like a prudent general, Mr. Ruby had always a great reser=
ve=E2=80=94opening a case, he said,=20

=E2=80=9CThere!=E2=80=9D and displayed a crucifix of the most exquisite wor=
kmanship and the most precious=20

materials.  =E2=80=9CI have no hesitation in saying the rarest jewel which =
this century has produced. See!=20

the figure by Monti; a masterpiece. Every emerald in the cross a picked sto=
ne. These corners,=20

your grace is aware,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Ruby, condescendingly, =E2=80=9Ccont=
ain the earth of the holy places at=20

Jerusalem. It has been shown to no one but your grace.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=
t is indeed most rare and beautiful,=E2=80=9D=20

said the duchess, =E2=80=9Cand most interesting, too, from containing the e=
arth of the holy places. A=20

commission, of course?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CFrom one of our most eminent patr=
ons,=E2=80=9D and then he mentioned=20

Lothair=E2=80=99s name.  Lady Corisande looked agitated.  =E2=80=9CNot for =
himself,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Ruby.  Lady=20

Corisande seemed relieved.  =E2=80=9CIt is a present to a young lady=E2=80=
=94Miss Arundel.=E2=80=9D  Lady Corisande=20

changed color, and, turning away, walked toward a case of works of art, whi=
ch was in the centre of=20

the shop, and appeared to be engrossed in their examination.       CHAPTER =
87 A day or two after=20

this adventure of the crucifix, Lothair met Bertram, who said to him, =E2=
=80=9CBy-the-by, if you want to see=20

my people before they leave town, you must call at once.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CYou do not mean that,=E2=80=9D replied Lothair,=20

much surprised. =E2=80=9CWhy, the duchess told me, only three or four days =
ago, that they should not=20

leave town until the end of the first week of August. They are going to the=
 weddings.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI do not=20

know what my mother said to you, my dear fellow, but they go to Brentham th=
e day after to-



morrow, and will not return. The duchess has been for a long time wishing t=
his, but Corisande=20

would stay. She thought they would only bother themselves about my affairs,=
 and there was more=20

distraction for them in town. But now they are going, and it is for Corisan=
de they go. She is not=20

well, and they have suddenly resolved to depart.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, I=
 am very sorry to hear it,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9CI=20

shall call at Crecy House. Do you think they will see me?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CCertain.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd what are your plans?=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CI have none,=E2=80=9D said Bertram. =E2=80=9CI suppose I must not =
leave my father alone at this moment. He has=20

behaved well; very kindly, indeed. I have nothing to complain of. But still=
 all is vague, and I feel=20

somehow or other I ought to be about him.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHave you heard=
 from our dear friends abroad?=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D said Bertram, with a sigh, =E2=80=9CEuphrosyne write=
s to me; but I believe St. Aldegonde knows=20

more about their views and plans than I do. He and Mr. Phoebus correspond m=
uch. I wish to=20

Heaven they were here, or rather that we were with them!=E2=80=9D he added,=
 with another sigh. =E2=80=9CHow=20

happy we all were, at Jerusalem! How I hate London! And Brentham worse. I s=
hall have to go to a=20

lot of agricultural dinners and all sorts of things. The duke expects it, a=
nd I am bound now to do=20

every thing to please him. What do you think of doing?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=
 neither know nor care,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, in=20

a tone of great despondency.  =E2=80=9CYou are a little hipped.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CNot a little. I suppose it is the excitement=20

of the last two years that has spoiled me for ordinary life. But I find the=
 whole thing utterly=20

intolerable, and regret now that I did not rejoin the staff of the general.=
 I shall never have such a=20

chance again. It was a mistake; but one is born to blunder.=E2=80=9D  Lotha=
ir called at Crecy House. The=20

hall-porter was not sure whether the duchess was at home, and the groom of =
the chambers went=20

to see. Lothair had never experienced this form. When the groom of the cham=
bers came down=20

again, he gave her grace=E2=80=99s compliments; but she had a headache, and=
 was obliged to lie down,=20

and was sorry she could not see Lothair, who went away livid.  Crecy House =
was only yards from=20

St. James=E2=80=99s Square, and Lothair repaired to an accustomed haunt. He=
 was not in a humor for=20

society, and yet he required sympathy. There were some painful associations=
 with the St. Jerome=20

family, and yet they had many charms. And the painful associations had been=
 greatly removed by=20

their easy and cordial reception of him, and the charms had been renewed an=
d increased by=20

subsequent intercourse. After all, they were the only people who had always=
 been kind to him.=20

And, if they had erred in a great particular, they had been animated by pur=
e, and even sacred,=20

motives. And had they erred? Were not his present feelings of something app=
roaching to=20

desolation a fresh proof that the spirit of man can alone be sustained by h=
igher relations than=20

merely human ones? So he knocked at the door, and Lady St. Jerome was at ho=
me. She had not=20

a headache; there were no mysterious whisperings between hall-porters and g=
rooms of the=20

chamber, to ascertain whether he was one of the initiated. Whether it were =
London or Vauxe, the=20

eyes of the household proved that he was ever a welcome and cherished guest=
.  Lady St. Jerome=20

was alone, and rose from her writing-table to receive him. And then=E2=80=
=94for she was a lady who=20

never lost a moment=E2=80=94she resumed some work, did not interfere with t=
heir conversation. Her=20

talking resources were so happy and inexhaustible, that it signified little=
 that her visitor, who was=20

bound in that character to have something to say, was silent and moody.  =
=E2=80=9CMy lord,=E2=80=9D she=20

continued, =E2=80=9Chas taken the Palazzo Agostini for a term. I think we s=
hould always pass our winters at=20

Rome under any circumstances, but=E2=80=94the cardinal has spoken to you ab=
out the great event=E2=80=94if=20

that comes off, of which, between ourselves, whatever the world may say, I =
believe there is no sort=20

of doubt, we should not think of being absent from Rome for a day during th=
e council.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy! it=20



may last years,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CThere is no reason why it s=
hould not last the Council of Trent. It has=20

in reality much more to do.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe do things quicker now,=E2=
=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome.  =E2=80=9CThat depends on=20

=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere will be no difficulty=20

when the Church has assembled,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome. =E2=80=9CThis=
 sight of the universal Fathers=20

coming from the uttermost ends of the earth to bear witness to the truth wi=

all the vain words and vainer thoughts of this unhappy century. It will be =
what they call a great fact,=20

dear Lothair; and when the Holy Spirit descends upon their decrees, my firm=
 belief is the whole=20

world will rise as it were from a trance, and kneel before the divine tomb =
of St. Peter.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, we=20

shall see,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CThe cardinal wishes you very mu=
ch to attend the council. He wishes you=20

to attend it as an Anglican, representing with a few others our laity. He s=
ays it would have the very=20

best effect for religion.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe spoke to me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CAnd you agreed to go?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have not refused him. If I=
=20

thought I could do any good I am not sure I would not go,=E2=80=9D said Lot=
hair; =E2=80=9Cbut, from what I have=20

seen of the Roman court, there is little hope of reconciling our difference=
s. Rome is stubborn.=20

Now, look at the difficulty they make about the marriage of a Protestant an=
d one of their own=20

communion. It is cruel, and I think on their part unwise.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CThe sacrament of marriage is of ineffable=20

holiness,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome.  =E2=80=9CI do not wish to deny th=
at,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cbut I see no reason=20

why I should not marry a Roman Catholic if I liked, without the Roman Churc=
h interfering and=20

entirely regulating my house and home.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI wish you would =
speak to Father Coleman about this,=E2=80=9D=20

said Lady St. Jerome.  =E2=80=9CI have had much talk with Father Coleman ab=
out many things in my time,=E2=80=9D=20

said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cbut not about this. By-the-by, have you any news of =
the monsignore?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe is in=20

Ireland, arranging about the Oecumenical Council. They do not understand th=
ese matters there as=20

well as we do in England, and his holiness, by the cardinal=E2=80=99s advic=
e, has sent the monsignore to=20

put things right.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAll the Father Colemans in the world c=

mixed marriages,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cthey can explain, but they=
 cannot alter. I want change in this=20

matter, and Rome never changes.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is impossible for the=
 Church to change,=E2=80=9D said Lady St.=20

Jerome, =E2=80=9Cbecause it is Truth.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIs Miss Arundel at=
 home?=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CI believe so,=E2=80=9D said Lady=20

St. Jerome.  =E2=80=9CI never see her now,=E2=80=9D he said, discontentedly=
. =E2=80=9CShe never goes to balls, and she=20

never rides. Except occasionally under this roof, she is invisible.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=98=E2=80=9CClare does not go any longer=20

into society,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome.  =E2=80=9CWhy?=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CWell, it is a secret,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome, with some=20

disturbance of countenance and speaking in a lower tone; =E2=80=9Cat least =
at present; and yet I can hardly=20

on such a subject wish that there should be a secret from you=E2=80=94Clare=
 is about to take the veil.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CThen I have not a friend left in the world,=E2=80=9D said Lothair,=
 in a despairing tone.  Lady St. Jerome=20

looked at him=20

"August 21.--I counted 103 giraffes. There is literally no game upon this s=
ide (west) of the Atbara,=20

as the country for twelve hours' journey from Sofi is thronged with Arabs d=
uring the dry season.=20

"All my people are more or less ill; I am not very well myself; but I have =
staved off an attack of=20

fever by preventive measures.  "August 25.--Such a magnificent sunset I hav=

determination so absolute, that we recognize the Divine purpose in her deci=

=E2=80=9CI do not bow to it,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9CI think it bar=

producing the most extraordinary effect of vivid colouring, combined with l=
ightning, and a rainbow.=20

"Rain in torrents throughout the night. It is now impossible to walk on the=
 flat table land, as the soil=20

is so saturated that it clings to the feet like birdlime, in masses that wi=
ll pull the shoes off unless=20

they fit tight. All this immense tract of rich land would grow any amount o=
f cotton, or wheat, as in=20

this country the rain falls with great regularity--this might be sent to Be=
rber by boats during the=20

season of flood.  "August 27.--My antelope skins are just completed and are=
 thoroughly tanned.=20

Each  =E2=80=9CThen my confidence in him is entirely destroyed,=E2=80=9D sa=
id Lothair.       CHAPTER 88 It was=20

August, and town was thinning fast. Parliament still lingered, but only for=
 technical purposes; the=20

political struggle of the session having terminated at the end of July. One=
 social event was yet to=20

be consummated=E2=80=94the marriages of Lothair=E2=80=99s cousins. They wer=
e to be married on the same day,=20

at the same time, and in the same place. Westminster Abbey was to be the sc=
ene, and, as it was=20

understood that the service was to be choral, great expectations of ecclesi=
astical splendor and=20

effect were much anticipated by the fair sex. They were, however, doomed to=
 disappointment, for,=20

although the day was fine, the attendance=20


_
'garra,' or fruit of the Acacia Arabica. The process is simple: the skin be=
ing thoroughly wetted, the=20

garra is pounded into a paste; this is rubbed into the hide with a rough pi=
ece of sandstone, until it=20

becomes perfectly clean, and free from impurities; it is then wrapped up wi=
th a quantity of the=20

paste, and is deposited in a trough and kept in the shade for twenty-four h=
ours. It should undergo=20

a similar rubbing daily, and be kept in the trough to soak in the garra for=
 four or five days. After this=20

process it should be well rubbed with fat, if required to keep soft and pli=
able when wetted. If=20

soaked in milk after tanning, the leather will become waterproof. The large=
 tanned ox-hides used=20

by the Arabs as coverlets are perfectly waterproof, and are simply prepared=
 with milk. These are=20

made in Abyssinia, and can be purchased at from ten piastres to a dollar ea=
ch. The Arabs=20

thoroughly appreciate the value of leather, as they are entirely dependent =
upon such material for=20

coverlets, watersacks, travelling bags, &c. &c. The sac de voyage is a simp=
le skin of either goat or=20

sheep drawn off the animal as a stocking is drawn from the leg; this is ver=
y neatly ornamented,=20

and arranged with loops which close the mouth, secured by a padlock. Very l=
arge sacks, capable=20

of containing three hundred pounds of corn, are made in the same manner by =
drawing off entire=20

the skins of the larger antelopes--that of the tetel is considered the most=
 valuable for this purpose.=20

The hide of the wild ass is the finest of all leather, and is so close in t=
he grain that before tanning,=20

when dry and hardened in the sun, it resembles horn in transparency. I have=
 made excellent=20

mocassins with this skin, which are admirable if kept wetted.  "August 28.-=
-Sofi being upon the=20

frontier, the laws are merely nominal; accordingly have =E2=80=9Cno popery.=
=E2=80=9D Lord Carisbrooke, who was a=20

ritualist, murmured, and was encouraged in his resistance by Lady Clanmorne=
 and a party, but, as=20

the Duke of Brecon was high and dry, there was a want of united action, and=
 Lord Culloden had=20

his way.  After the ceremony, the world repaired to the mansion of Lord Cul=
loden in Belgrave=20

Square, to inspect the presents, and to partake of a dinner called a breakf=
ast. Cousin Lothair=20

wandered about the rooms, and had the satisfaction of seeing a bracelet wit=
h a rare and splendid=20

sapphire which he had given to Lady Flora, and a circlet of diamond stars w=
hich he had placed on=20

the brow of the Duchess of Brecon. The St. Aldegondes were the only members=
 of the Brentham=20

family who were present. St. Aldegonde had a taste for marriages and public=
 executions, and Lady=20

St. Aldegonde wandered about with Lothair, and pointed out to him Corisande=

cousins.  =E2=80=9CI never was more disappointed than by your family leavin=

when I called to say farewell, because she had a headache.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CI never knew mamma to have a=20

headache,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Aldegonde.  =E2=80=9CI suppose you will be=
