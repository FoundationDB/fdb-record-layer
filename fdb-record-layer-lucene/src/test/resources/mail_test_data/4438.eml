eight miles and composed approximately of 90 slaves is where Louis Napoleon first saw the light 

of day.  Louis' father was known as the wagoner. His duties were to haul the commodities raised 

on the plantation and other things that required a wagon. His mother Edith, was known as a 

"breeder" and was kept in the palatial Randolph mansion to loom cloth for the Randolph family and 

slaves. The cloth was made from the cotton raised on the plantation's fertile fields. As Louis was 

so young, he had no particular duties, only to look for hen nests, gather eggs and play with the 

master's three young boys. There were seven children in the Randolph family, three young boys, 

two "missy" girls and two grown sons. Louis would go fishing and hunting with the three younger 

boys and otherwise engage with them in their childish pranks.  He says that his master and 

mistress were very kind to the slaves and would never whip them, nor would he allow the "driver" 

who was a white man named Barton to do so. Barton lived in a home especially built for him on

more or less directly into simple nature- worship, childish, non-moral, and often immoral. But when 

Hector says that he holds omens of no account, and that the best omen of all is to fight for one's 

country, he shows an incipient reliance on a Moral Power. The disengagement of religion from 

mythology is of course much further advanced and more manifest when we come to Plato; while 

the religious faith, instead of being weaker, has become infinitely stronger, and is capable of 

supporting the life and the martyrdom of Socrates. When Socrates and Plato reject the Homeric 

mythology, it is not because they are sceptics but because Homer is a child.  But it is in the Old 

Testament that the process of disengagement and the growth of a moral out of a ceremonial 

religion are most distinctly seen:--    "'Wherewith shall I come before Jahveh,   And bow myself 

down before God on high?   Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,   With the sacrifice of 

calves of a

built for them. They were ceiled and arranged in such a manner as to retain the   --Will Jahveh be 

pleased with thousands of rams,   With ten thousands of rivers of oil?   Shall I give my first-born for 

my transgression,   The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?'   '--He hath showed thee, O man,

heat in winter from the large fireplaces constructed therein.  Just before the dawn of day, the 

slaves were aroused from their slumber by a loud blast from a cow-horn that was blown by the 

"driver" as a signal to prepare themselves for the fields. The plantation being so expansive, those 

who had to go a long distance to the area where they worked, were taken in wagons, those 

working nearby walked. They took their meals along with them and   What but to do justly to love 

mercy,   And to walk humbly with thy God?'"  Here no doubt is a belief in the efficacy of sacrifice, 

even of human sacrifice, even of the sacrifice of the first-born. But it is a receding and dying belief; 

while the belief in the power of justice, mercy, humility, moral religion in short, is prevailing over it 

and taking its place.  So it is again in the New Testament with regard to spiritual life and the
