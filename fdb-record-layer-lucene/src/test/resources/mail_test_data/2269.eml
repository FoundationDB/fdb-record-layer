Chatham street. His quick eye detected the improved state of his friend's a=
pparel, and his=20

indignation rose, as he reflected that Jerry had pocketed the profits while=
 the hard knocks had=20

been his.  "Jerry!" he called out.  Jerry did not see fit to heed the call.=
 He was sensible that Mike=20

had something to complain of, and he was in no hurry to meet his reproaches=
.  "Jerry McGaverty!"=20

called Mike, coming near.  "Oh, it's you, Mike, is it?" answered Jerry, una=
ble longer to keep up the=20

pretense of not hearing.  "Yes, it's me," said Mike. "What made you leave m=
e for last night?"  "I=20

didn't want to interfere betwane two gintlemen," said Jerry, with a grin. "=
Did you mash him, Mike?"=20

"No," said Mike, sullenly, "he mashed me. Why didn't you help me?"  "I thou=
ght you was bating=20

him, so, as I had some business to attind to, I went away."  "You went away=
 wid the shirt."  "Yes, I=20

took it by mistake. Ain't it an illigant fit?"  "It's big enough for two of=
 you."  "Maybe I'll grow to it in=20

time," said Jerry.  "And how much are you goin' to give me for my share?" d=
emanded Mike.  "Say=20

that ag'in," said Jerry.  Mike repeated it.  "I thought maybe I didn't hear=
 straight. It ain't yours at all.=20

Didn't I take it?"  "You wouldn't have got it if I hadn't fit with Paul."  =
"That ain't nothin' to me," said=20

Jerry. "The shirt's mine, and I'll kape it."  Mike felt strongly tempted to=
 "put a head on" Jerry,=20

whatever that may mean; but, as Jerry was a head taller already, the attemp=
t did not seem quite=20

prudent. He indulged in some forcible remarks, which, however, did not dist=
urb Jerry's equanimity.=20

"I'll give you my old shirt, Mike," he said, "if you can find it. I left it=
 in an alley near the Old Bowery."=20

"I don't want the dirty rag," said Mike, contemptuously.  Finally a comprom=
ise was effected, Jerry=20

offering to help Mike on the next occasion, and leave the spoils in his han=
ds.  I have to chronicle=20

another adventure of Jerry's, in which he was less fortunate than he had be=
en in the present case.=20

He was a genuine vagabond, and lived by his wits, being too lazy to devote =
himself to any regular=20

street employment, as boot blacking or selling newspapers. Occasionally he =
did a little work at=20

each of these, but regular, persistent industry was out of his line. He was=
 a drone by inclination,=20

and a decided enemy to work. On the subject of honesty his principles were =
far from strict. If he=20

could appropriate what did not belong to him he was ready to do so without =
scruple. This=20

propensity had several times brought him into trouble, and he had more than=
 once been sent to=20

reside temporarily on Blackwell's Island, from which he had returned by no =
means improved.  Mike=20

was not quite so much of a vagabond as his companion. He could work at time=
s, though he did not=20

like it, and once pursued the vocation of a bootblack for several months wi=
th fair success.  But=20

Jerry's companionship was doing him no good, and it seemed likely that even=
tually he would=20

become quite as shiftless as Jerry himself.  Jerry, having no breakfast, st=
rolled down to one of the=20

city markets. He frequently found an opportunity of stealing here, and was =
now in search of such a=20

chance. He was a dexterous and experienced barrel thief, a term which it ma=
y be necessary to=20

explain. Barrels, then, have a commercial value, and coopers will generally=
 pay twenty-five cents=20

for one in good condition. This is enough, in the eyes of many a young vaga=
bond, to pay for the=20

risk incurred in stealing one.  Jerry prowled round the market for some tim=
e, seeking a good=20

opportunity to walk off with an apple or banana, or something eatable. But =
the guardians of the=20

stands seemed unusually vigilant, and he was compelled to give up the attem=
pt, as involving too=20

great risk. Jerry was hungry, and hunger is an uncomfortable feeling. He be=
gan to wish he had=20

remained satisfied with his old shirt, dirty as it was, and carried the new=
 one to some of the Baxter=20

street dealers, from whom he could perhaps have got fifty cents for it. Now=
, fifty cents would have=20

paid for a breakfast and a couple of cigars, and those just now would have =
made Jerry happy.=20



"What a fool I was not to think of it!" he said. "The old shirt would do me=
, and I could buy a bully=20

breakfast wid the money I'd get for this."  Just at this moment he espied a=
n empty barrel--a barrel=20

apparently quite new and in an unguarded position. He resolved to take it, =
but the affair must be=20

managed slyly.  He lounged up to the barrel, and leaned upon it indolently.=
 Then, in apparent=20

world.  As at Carlisle and Gretna in the old days, or as at Tuy and Valenza=
 even to-day, the river=20

had set a barrier between the peoples as it had been ten miles instead of a=
 few hundred yards in=20

width. Certainly, on the Banda Oriental, especially in the department of Ta=
cuaremb=C3=B2, many=20

Brazilians had emigrated and settled there, but living amongst the Gaucho p=
opulation, in a=20

measure they had been forced to conform to the customs of the land.  That i=
s, they practised=20

hospitality after the Gaucho fashion, taking no money from the wayfaring ma=
n for a piece of beef;=20

they lent a horse, usually the worst they had, if one came to their house w=
ith one=E2=80=99s horse tired;=20

their women showed themselves  occasionally; and not being able to hold sla=
ves, they were=20

obliged to adopt a different tone to men in general than that they practise=
d in the Empire of Brazil.=20

But in the time of which I write, in their own country they still carried s=
words, slaves trotted after=20

the rich =E2=80=9Cfazendero=E2=80=99s=E2=80=9D horse, the women of the fami=
ly never sat down to table with the men, and if=20

a stranger chanced to call on business at their house, they were as jealous=
ly kept from his eyes as=20

they had all been Turks.  The =E2=80=9CFazenda=E2=80=9D houses had great ir=
on-studded doors, often a moat, and=20

not infrequently a rusty cannon, though generally dismounted, and a relic o=
f bygone time.  The=20

traveller fared, as a general rule, much worse than in the Banda Oriental, =
for save at the large=20

cattle-farms it was impossible to buy a piece of meat.  Admitted to the hou=
se, one rarely passed=20

beyond the guest-chamber, a room with four bare white-washed walls; having =
for furniture a=20

narrow hard-wood table with wrought-iron supports between its legs; chairs =
cut apparently out of=20

the solid block, and a tin bucket or a large gourd in the corner, with drin=
king-water; so that one=E2=80=99s=20

sojourn at the place was generally brief, and one=E2=80=99s departure a rel=
ief to all concerned.  Still on the=20

frontier the Gaucho influence made itself a little felt, and people were no=
t so inhospitable as they=20

were further in the interior of the land.  Two or three leagues beyond the =
pass there was a little=20

town called =E2=80=9CDon Pedrito,=E2=80=9D towards which we made; but a =E2=
=80=9CPampero,=E2=80=9D whistling from the south,=20

forced us to camp upon a stream known as the =E2=80=9CPoncho Verde,=E2=80=
=9D where, in the forties, Garibaldi=20

was reported to have fought.  Wet to the skin and without food, we saw a fa=
zenda not a mile away,=20

rode up to it, and for a wonder were asked inside, had dinner in the guest-=
chamber, the owner=20

sitting but not eating with us; the black Brazilian beans and bacon carried=
 in pompously by three or=20

four stalwart slaves, who puffed and sweated, trod on each other=E2=80=99s =
naked toes, and generally=20

behaved as they had been carrying sacks of corn aboard a ship, only that in=
 this instance no one=20

stood in the gangway with a whip.  Much did the conversation run on politic=
s; upon =E2=80=9CA Guerra dos=20

Farapos,=E2=80=9D which it appeared had riven the country in twain what tim=
e our host was young. Farapo=20

means a rag, and the Republicans of fifty years ago in Rio Grande had adopt=
ed the device after=20

the fashion of =E2=80=9CLes gueux.=E2=80=9D  Long did they fight, and our h=
ost said: =E2=80=9CPraise to God, infructuously,=E2=80=9D=20

for how could men who wore moustaches and full beards be compared to those =
who, like our host=20

himself, wore whiskers carefully trimmed in the style of those which at the=
 same epoch in our=20

country were the trade-mark of the Iron Duke?  Elective kings, for so the o=
ld =E2=80=9Cconservador=E2=80=9D termed=20

presidents, did not find favour in his eyes; and in religion too the =E2=80=
=9Cfarapos=E2=80=9D were seriously astray.=20

They held the doctrine that all creeds should be allowed; which I once held=
 myself, but now incline=20



to the belief that a religion and a name should be bestowed at baptism, and=
 that it should be=20

constituted heresy of the worst kind, and punishable by a fine, to change o=
r palter with either the=20

name or the religion which our fathers have bestowed.  Politics over, we fe=
ll a-talking upon other=20

lands; on Europe and England, Portugal, and as to whether =E2=80=9CRondon=
=E2=80=9D was larger than Pelotas, or=20

matters of that sort.  Then our host inquired if in =E2=80=9CRondon=E2=80=
=9D we did not use =E2=80=9Cla bosa,=E2=80=9D and I not=20

taking the thing up, he rose and stretching out his hands, set them revolvi=
ng like a saw, and I then=20

saw our supposed national pastime was what he meant; and told him that it w=
as practised, held in=20

repute, and marked us out as a people set apart; and that our greatness was=
 largely founded on=20

the exercise he had endeavoured to depict.  We bade=20


_
position. If observed, he could easily deny all felonious intentions. This =
he kept up till he got round=20

the corner, when, glancing around to see if he was observed, he quickly lif=
ted it on his shoulder=20

and marched off.  All this happened without his being observed by the owner=
 of the barrel. But a=20

policeman, who chanced to be going his rounds, had been a witness of Jerry'=
s little game. He the=20

place; but as we left, a rustling at the door showed that the snuff-and-but=
ter-coloured sex had=20

been observing us after the fashion practised in Morocco and in houses in t=
he East.  The=20

hospitable =E2=80=9Cconservador=E2=80=9D sent down a slave with a great bas=
ket full of oranges; and seated at the=20

camp we ate at least three dozen, whilst the man waited patiently to take t=
he basket back.  Night=20

caught=20


_
evident, then walked quietly up and put his hand on his shoulder.  "Put dow=
n that barrel!" he said,=20

authoritatively.  Jerry had been indulging in visions of the breakfast he w=
ould get with the twenty-

five cents he expected to obtain for the barrel, and the interruption was n=
ot an agreeable one. But=20

he determined to brazen it out if possible.  "What for will I put it down?"=
 he said.  "Because you=20

have stolen it, that's why."  "No," congealing as they fell.  Three of us m=
uffled in ponchos rode=20

round the horses, whilst the others crouched at the fire, and midnight come=
, the riders rode to the=20

fire, and stretched on the wet mud slept fitfully, whilst the others took t=
heir place.  Day came at=20

last; and miserable we looked, wet, cold, and hungry, the fire black out, m=
atches all damp, and=20

nothing else to do but march till the sun rose and made life tolerable.=20
