work (any work on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase 

"Project Gutenberg" is associated) is reddening of his eyes. Something of that most moving of all 

sentiments, self-pity, was in his tone. He foresaw Bauby's apron at her eyes for him, and in her 

grief over her brother, his own heart was profoundly moved. "There will be some things that 

nobody can save her from: but for all that concerns this world, if I could be sure that nothing would 

happen to Bauby----"  "Well, Rolls, you're past my comprehension," said Mr Monypenny; "but so 

far as taking care of Bauby in case anything happens to you--though what should happen to you I 

have yet to learn."  "That is just so," said Rolls, getting up slowly. There was about him altogether 

a great solemnity, like a man at a funeral, Mr Monypenny said afterwards. "I cannot expect you to 

know, sir--that's atween me and my Maker. I'm no' going back to Dalrulzian. I cannot have my 

mind disturbed at this awfu' moment, as ye say, with weemen and their ways. If ye see the English 

gentleman, ye'll maybe explain. Marget has a very guid notion o' waitin'; she can do all that's 

necessary; and for me, I've ither work in hand."  "You must not look at everything in so gloomy a 

spirit, Rolls," said Mr Monypenny, holding out his hand. He was not in the habit of shaking hands 

with the butler, but there are occasions when rules are involuntarily broken through.  "No' a gloomy 

spirit, sir, but awfu' serious," said Rolls. "You'll tell the young maister no' to be down-hearted, but 

at the same time no' to be that prood. Help may come when it's little looked for. I'm no' a man of 

mony words, but I've been, as you say, sir, attached to the family all my days, and I have just a 

feeling for them more than

Miss Nora was just the person;--but I mustna think now of making conditions," he said, hurriedly--

"we'll leave that to his good sense. Mony thanks to you, sir, for hearing me out, and shaking my 

hand as ye've done; though there's maybe things I have said that are a wee hard to understand." 

"Ay, Rolls," said Mr Monypenny, laughing, "you're just like the other prophets; a great deal of what
