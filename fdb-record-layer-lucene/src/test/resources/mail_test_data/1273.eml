dracaena marginata possible. Will you come with me to her house now, and see what you can do? She will provide you with the flowers and the glasses to put them into, and you can arrange them on the table just as you like best. She will give you a guinea 'phoning in creation won't stop her.

hear some news of my darling little Daisy?"  "Seeing as I can't comfort you, Miss Jasmine, I may 

as well take to reading the mysterious, lovely story," answered Poppy. "Maybe when you're having 

your dinner bye-and-bye, miss, you won't object to me telling you what I thinks of it."  "Only I shan't 

care in the least what you think to-day, dear Poppy," answered poor little Jasmine, in a tone of 

deep melancholy.  She went and stood by the window, and Poppy ensconced herself comfortably 

on the sofa, and began to enjoy herself as best she could under the circumstances.  In about an 

hour there came a tap at the door, and Arthur Noel came in. Jasmine gave a little pleased 

exclamation when she saw him; then she ran forward, took his hand in hers, and burst into tears. 

"Daisy is lost," she said; "our sweet little Daisy, who loved you so much, is lost."  "It's inferred that 

she's gone down with a single third to Rosebury, sir," here interposed Poppy.  "Come and tell me 

all about it, Jasmine," said Noel, in his most sympathizing tones. He led the poor little girl to the 

sofa, and, sitting down by her, listened attentively to her story.  "But the Ellsworthys are in 

London," he said, when he heard that Daisy had gone to them.  On hearing this news poor 

Jasmine burst into  "Tush. Tush. Don't cry over an old salt like me. I tell you I ain't wuth it, not one 

precious drop."  "If you only knew!"  "Maybe I ain't so deep in the fog as you think. I took another 

trip while I was in the city to see a lawyer, and I found out some mighty interesting things."  "But he 

couldn't tell you everything."  "Beth, is there something you'd otter tell me?"  "There is--there was--

but I guess----Did you see a good lawyer?"  "The best I could find."  "Then, why did you sacrifice 

your boat? It was so needless."  "I had to have that much money right off, and there wa'n't no time 

to look about. I didn't think you'd take it like this or I'd sartin never done it."  "If you had only come 

to me I could have let you have that much without you having to sell your boat."  "It would have 

been a mite queer to borrow from you to pay your dad, wouldn't it?"  "What does that matter?" 

"Nothing, much.... But you was going to tell me something."  She lifted her tear-stained face, and 

slowly shook her head. "Not now. I might cry again, and I've been silly enough for one day."  "You 

ain't been silly, not one mite. I had no right to make you cry by telling you things that don't consarn 

you."  "Indeed, you should have told me, and it does concern, far more than you think,"

"Oh, then she's sure to be quite lost!" she said. "Oh, Mr. Noel, if you are in any sense a true friend, 

won't you try to find her?"  "Yes, Jasmine; I will never rest until I find her. I am glad I came in to-

day. I came to ask you to do something for me, but I find you want my help instead. I will come 

here this evening, about the time your sister is likely to be back, and I will then go and look for 

Daisy, in case she is not found. Don't be frightened, Jasmine, I am quite sure we shall soon get 

tidings of the dear little girl."  "And do you know," said Jasmine, who felt a little comforted, "that we 

have not only lost Daisy, but all our quarter's money. It is most mysterious. Primrose gave Daisy a 

check to take care of for her, and Daisy says she has gone away because the cheque is lost. We 

have no money now that the cheque is lost, except just what Primrose earns from Mrs. Mortlock." 

"There's a likelihood of some more earnings presently, Miss Jasmine," here interposed Poppy, in a 

cheerful voice; "there's a likelihood of a good bit more money when this powerful and thrilling 

romance is published."  "Your story, Jasmine?" said Noel, "and frightful."  "You don't look nothing 

of the sort. You couldn't if you tried to."  "Will you be home to-night, Uncle Josiah?" she asked, 

looking at her wrist-watch. It was half-past ten o'clock.  "Cal'late to be."  "May I come to see you?" 

"That's a funny question. I should say you can come. Clemmie will be real glad to see you, and so 

will the minister."  "I'm coming to see you," she said, coloring. "I'm going home now. Good-bye." 

She hurriedly kissed him, and before he had time to speak she was half-way up the hill. At the rear 

gate she waved, then disappeared behind the mass of shrubbery that lined her father's place.  Ten 

minutes later the Captain heard the roar of the open exhaust from the girl's motor. Like a red 

streak the car shot down the hill of the Fox estate and into County Road. The Captain gasped as 

he watched a cloud of dust engulf the flying car.     CHAPTER XVI   All those who saw the flying 

car stood and stared after it. Hank Simpson, who was on his way over from the Little River railroad 

station with a load of merchandise, heard the roar, and sprang from his wagon-seat. He ran to his 

horses' heads. But no sooner had he

publish it, my dear child? Oh, you must let me read this."  "Another time, please, Mr. Noel. I don't 

think I could quite bear it to-day," said Jasmine.  Noel looked at her earnestly.  "I wonder, 

Jasmine," he said, "even though you are in such trouble, if you would be brave enough to help 

_me_, and to earn a little money to day? I want you to do quite a simple thing, and something you 

will probably enjoy. I have never read any of your romances, but I bits of the frightened animals 

than he let go. He recognized the girl who sped past him. He clambered back into his wagon and 

whipped his team into a dead run. He drew rein on the racing horses before a group of gaping 

men in front of the general store.  "Did you see anything down yon way, Hank?" asked Jud 

Johnson.  "See!" exclaimed Hank, rubbing the dust from his eyes. "See! Good God! Boys, that 

damn thing was running away! Hear me? It was running

often noticed that you possess rather remarkable artistic tastes, and that you have a very correct 

eye for the arrangement of color. I have been struck with this even in this little room, and I 

happened to mention my observations one day to a lady who is a friend of mine. That lady is 

giving a dinner-party to-night, and she wants some one to arrange hell! What are you gaping fools 

standing here for, looking like a passel of brainless idiots! 'Phone!" he screamed.  "'Phone what? 

Who to?" asked Jud with exasperating calm.  "Everything! Everybody!" was the doubly illuminating 

reply. "She'll be killed! Do you hear me?"  "We'd have to be deaf as nails not to hear you," said 

Jud as he spat a mouthful
