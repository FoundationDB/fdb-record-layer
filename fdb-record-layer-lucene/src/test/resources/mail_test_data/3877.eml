e down the nut-walk and=20

see the _myosotis arvensis_; it is already in bloom, the weather has been s=
o warm.  "Miss Ross,"=20

Mr. Withells continued seriously, as they turned into the nut-walk which le=
d back towards the=20

house, "we have known each other for a considerable time...."  "We have," s=
aid Jan, as he had=20

paused, evidently expecting a reply.  "And I have come to have a great rega=
rd for you...."  Again=20

he paused, and Jan found herself silently whispering, "Curtsy while you're =
thinking--it saves time,"=20

but she preserved an outward silence.  "You are, if I may say so, the most =
sensible woman of my=20

acquaintance."  "Thank you," said Jan, but without enthusiasm.  "We are nei=
ther of us quite=20

young"--(Mr. Withells was forty-nine, but it was a little hard on Jan)--"an=
d I feel sure that you, for=20

instance, would not expect or desire from a husband those constant outward =
demonstrations of=20

affection such as handclaspings and kisses, which are so foolish and insani=
tary."  Jan turned=20

extremely red and walked rather faster.  "Do not misunderstand me, Miss Ros=
s," Mr. Withells=20

continued, looking with real admiration at her downcast, rosy face--she mus=
t be quite healthy he=20

thought, to look so clean and fresh always--"I lay down no hard-and-fast ru=
les. I do not say should=20

my wife desire to kiss me sometimes, that I should ... repulse her."  Jan g=
asped.  "But I have the=20

greatest objection, both on sanitary and moral grounds to----"  "I can't im=
agine anyone _wanting_=20

to kiss you," Jan interrupted furiously; "you're far too puffy and stippled=
."  And she ran from him as=20

though an angry bull were after her.  Mr. Withells stood stock-still where =
he was, in pained=20

astonishment.  He saw the fleeing fair one disappear into the distance and =
in the shortest time on=20

record he heard the clanging of her bicycle bell as she scorched down his d=
rive.  "Puffy and=20

stippled"--"Puffy and stippled"!  Mr. Withells repeated to himself this rud=
ely personal remark as he=20

walked slowly towards the house.  What could she mean?  And what in the wor=
ld had he said to=20

make her so angry?  Women were really most unaccountable.  He ascended his =
handsome=20

staircase and went into his dressing-room, and there he sought his looking-=
glass, which stood in=20



the window, and surveyed himself critically. Yes, his cheeks _were_ a bit p=
uffy near the nostrils,=20

and, as is generally the case in later life, the pores of the skin were a b=
it enlarged, but for all that=20

he was quite a personable man.  He sighed. Miss Ross, he feared, was not ne=
arly so sensible as=20

he had thought.  It was distinctly disappointing.         *       *       *=
       *       *  For the first mile and a=20

quarter Jan scorched all she knew. The angry blood was thumping in her ears=
 and she exclaimed=20

indignantly at intervals, "How dared he! How dared he!"  Then she punctured=
 a tyre.  There was no=20

hope of getting it mended till she reached Wren's End, when Earley would do=
 it for her. As she=20

pushed her bicycle along the lane she recovered her sense of humour and she=
 laughed. And=20

presently she became aware of a faint, sweet, elusive perfume from some flo=
wering shrub on the=20

other side of somebody's garden wall.  It strongly resembled the smell of a=
 blossoming tree that=20

grew on Ridge Road, Malabar Hill. And in one second Jan was in Bombay, and =
was standing in=20

the moonlight, looking up into a face that was neither puffy nor stippled n=
or prim; but young and=20

thin and worn and very kind. And the exquisite understanding of that moment=
 came back to her,=20

and her eyes filled with tears.  Yet in another moment she was again demand=
ing indignantly, "How=20

dared he!"  She went straight to her room when she got in, and, like Mr. Wi=
thells, she went and=20

looked at herself in the glass.  Unlike Mr. Withells, she saw nothing there=
 to give her any=20

satisfaction. She shook her head at the person in the glass and said aloud:=
  "If that's all you get by=20

trying to be sensible, the sooner you become a drivelling idiot the better =
for your peace of mind--

and your vanity."  The person in the glass shook her head back at Jan, and =
Jan turned away=20

thoroughly disgusted with such a futile sort of _tu quoque_.     CHAPTER XX=
I  ANOTHER WAY=20

OF LOVE   Meg and the children, returning from their tea-party at the vicar=
age, were stopped=20

continually in their journey through the main street by friendly folk who w=
anted to greet the=20

children. It was quite a triumphal progress, and Meg was feeling particular=
ly proud that afternoon,=20

for her charges, including William, had all behaved beautifully. Little Fay=
 had refrained from=20

snatching other children's belongings with the cool remark, "Plitty little =
Fay would like 'at"; Tony=20

had been quite merry and approachable; and William had offered paws and sub=
mitted to continual=20

pullings, pushings and draggings with exemplary patience.  Once through the=
 friendly, dignified old=20

street, they reached the main road, which was bordered by rough grass slopi=
ng to a ditch=20

surmounted by a thick thorn hedge. They were rather late, and Meg was wheel=
ing little Fay as fast=20

as she could, Tony trotting beside her to keep up, when a motor horn was so=
unded behind them=20

and a large car came along at a good speed. They were all well to the side =
of the road, but=20

William--with the perverse stupidity of the young dog--above all, of the yo=
ung bull-terrier--chose=20

that precise moment to gambol aimlessly right into the path of the swiftly-=
coming motor, just as=20

It seemed that destruction must inevitably overtake William when the car sw=
erved violently as the=20

man ran it down the sloping bank, where it stuck, leaving William, unscathe=
d and rather alarmed=20

by all the clamour, to run back to his family.  Meg promptly whacked him as=
 hard as she could,=20

whereupon, much surprised, he turned over on his back, waving four paws fee=
bly in the air.  "Why=20

don't you keep your dog at the side?" the man shouted with very natural irr=
itation as he descended=20

from his seat.  "He's a naughty--stupid--puppy," Meg ejaculated between the=
 whacks. "It wasn't=20

your fault in the least, and it was awfully good of you to avoid him."--Wha=
ck--whack.  The man=20

started a little as she spoke and came across the road towards them.  Meg r=
aised a flushed face=20

from her castigation of William, but the pretty colour faded quickly when s=
he saw who the stranger=20

was.  "Meg!" he exclaimed. "_You!_"  For a tense moment they stared at one =
another, while the=20

children stared at the stranger. He was certainly a handsome man; melanchol=
y, "interesting." Pale,=20

with regular features and sleepy, smallish eyes set very near together.  "I=
f you knew how I have=20

searched for you," he said.  His voice was his great charm, and would have =
made his fortune on=20

the stage. It could convey so much, could be so tender and beseeching, so c=
harged with deepest=20

sadness,=20

  "Your search=20

cannot have been very arduous," Meg answered drily. "There has never been a=
ny mystery about=20

my movements." And she looked him straight in the face.  "At first, I was a=
fraid ... I did not try to=20

find you."  "You were well-advised."  "Who is 'at sahib?" little Fay interr=
upted impatiently. "Let us=20

go home." She had no use for any sahib who ignored her presence.  "Yes, we'=
d better be getting=20

on," Meg said hurriedly, and seized the handle of the pram.  But he stood r=
ight in their path.  "You=20

were very cruel," the musical voice went on. "You never seemed to give a th=
ought to all _I_ was=20

suffering."  Meg met the sleepy eyes, that used to thrill her very soul, wi=
th a look of scornful=20

amusement in hers that was certainly the very last expression he had ever e=
xpected to see in=20



them.  She had always dreaded this moment.  Realising the power this man ha=
d exercised over=20

her, she always feared that should she meet him again the old glamour would=
 surround him; the=20

old domination be reasserted. She forgot that in five years one's standards=
 change.  Now that she=20

did meet him she discovered that he held no bonds with which to bind her. T=
hat what she had=20

dreaded was a chimera. The real Walter Brooke, the moment he appeared in th=
e flesh, destroyed=20

the image memory had set up; and Meg straightened her slender shoulders as =
though a heavy=20

burden had dropped from them.  The whole thing passed like a flash.  "You w=
ere very cruel," he=20

repeated.  "There is no use going into all that," Meg answered in a cheerfu=
l, matter-of-fact tone.=20

"Good-bye, Mr. Brooke. We are most grateful to you for not running over Wil=
liam, who is," here=20

she raised her voice for the benefit of the culprit, "a naughty--tiresome d=
og."  "But you can't leave=20

me like this. When can I see you again--there is so much I want to explain.=
..."  "But I don't want=20

any explanations, thank you. Come children, we _must_ go."  "Meg, listen ..=
. surely you have=20

some little feeling of kindness towards me ... after all that happened...."=
  He put his hand on Meg's=20

arm to detain her, and William, who had never been known to show enmity to =
human creature,=20

gave a deep growl and bristled. A growl so ominous and threatening that Meg=
 hastily loosed the=20

pram and caught him by the collar with both hands.  Tony saw that Meg was f=
lustered and=20

uncomfortable. "Why does he not go?" he asked. "I thought he was a sahib, b=
ut I suppose he is=20

the gharri-wallah. We have thanked him--does he want backsheesh? Give him a=
 rupee."  "He=20

_does_ want backsheesh," the deep, musical voice went on--"a little pity, a=
 little common=20

kindness."  It was an embarrassing situation. William was straining at his =
collar and growling like=20

an incipient thunderstorm.  "We have thanked you," Tony said again with dig=
nity. "We have no=20

money, or we would reward you. If you like to call at the house, Auntie Jan=
 always has money."=20

The man smiled pleasantly at Tony.  "Thank you, young man. You have told me=
 exactly what I=20

wanted to know. So you are with your friends?"  "I can't hold this dog much=
 longer," Meg gasped.=20

"If you don't go--you'll get bitten."  William ceased to growl,=20
