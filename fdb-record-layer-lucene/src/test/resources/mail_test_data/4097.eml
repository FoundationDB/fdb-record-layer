sense is in our possession: it is possibly that of geometrical form, and it=
s steps of progression=20

would be 5 x 7, or 35.  The fourth sense is that of physical hearing, music=
, and its progressions are=20

28, or 4 x 7. The truth of this is demonstrated by the fact that it is in a=
ccord with the theories of=20

Science as to the vibrations of musical notes. Our scale is as follows:  --=
, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140,=20

168, 196, 224, 252, 280, 308, 336, 364, 392, 420, 448, 476, 504, 532, 560, =
588, 616, 644, 672,=20

700.  According to musical science, the notes C, E, G, are as 4, 5, 6, in t=
heir ratios of vibrations.=20

The same ratio obtains between the notes of the triplet G, B, D, and F, A, =
C.  H. C.     Notes On=20

Some Oral Teachings.    The Three Vital Airs.   It is the pure Akasha that =
passes up Sushumna: its=20

two aspects flow in Ida and Pingala. These are the three vital airs, and ar=
e symbolized by the=20

Brahmanical thread. They are ruled by the Will. Will and Desire are the hig=
her and lower aspects=20

of one and the same thing. Hence the importance of the purity of the canals=
; for if they soil the vital=20

airs energized by the Will, Black Magic results. This is why all sexual int=
ercourse is forbidden in=20

practical Occultism.  From Sushumna, Ida and Pingala a circulation is set u=
p, and from the central=20

canal passes into the whole body. (Man is a tree; he has in him the macroco=
sm and the=20

microcosm. Hence the trees used as symbols; the Dhyan-Chohanic body is thus=
 figured.)    The=20

Auric Egg.   The Auric Egg is formed in curves, which may be conceived from=
 the curves formed=20

by sand on a vibrating metal disk. Each atom, as each body, has its Auric E=
gg, each centre=20

forming its own. This Auric Egg, with the appropriate materials thrown into=
 it, is a defence; no wild=20

animal, however ferocious, will approach the Yogi thus guarded: it flings b=
ack from its surface all=20

malign influences. No Will power is manifested through the Auric Egg.  _Q. =
What is the connection=20

between the circulation of the vital airs and the power of the Yogi to make=
 his Auric Egg a defence=20

against aggression?_  _A._ It is impossible to answer this question. The kn=
owledge is the last=20

word of Magic. It is connected with Kundalini, that can as easily destroy a=
s preserve. The ignorant=20

tyro might kill himself.  _Q. Is the Auric Egg of a child a differentiation=
 of Akasha, into which may=20

be thrown by the Adept the materials he needs for special purposes_--_e.g._=
, _the Mayavi=20

Rupa?_  [The question was somewhat obscurely worded. Evidently what the que=
stioner wanted to=20

know was if the Auric Egg was a differentiation of Akasha, into which, as t=
he child became a man,=20

he might, if an Adept, weave the materials needed for special purposes, etc=
.]  _A._ Taking the=20

question in the sense of an Adept putting something into or acting on the A=
uric Egg of a child, then=20

this could not be done, as the Auric Egg is Karmic, and not even an Adept m=
ust interfere with such=20

Karmic record. If the Adept were to put anything into the Auric Egg of anot=
her, for which the=20

person is not responsible, or which does not come from the Higher Self of t=
hat personality, how=20

could Karmic justice be maintained?  The Adept can draw into his own Auric =
Egg from his planet,=20

or even from that of the globe or of the universe, according to his degree.=
 This envelope is the=20

receptacle of all Karmic causes, and photographs all things like a sensitiv=
e plate.  The child has a=20

very small Auric Egg business was a serious one.  "By-the-bye," continued D=
'Artagnan, "should=20

this man attempt to fly or to call out, pass your sword through his body." =
 The musketeer signified=20

by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter, and D'Artagnan=
 went out, followed=20

by Bernouin. Midnight struck.  "Lead me into the queen's oratory," said D'A=
rtagnan, "announce to=20

her I am here, and put this parcel, with a well-loaded musket, under the se=
at of the carriage which=20



is waiting at the foot of the private stair."  Bernouin conducted D'Artagna=
n to the oratory, where he=20

sat down pensively. Everything had gone on as usual at the Palais Royal. As=
 we said before, by=20

ten o'clock almost all the guests had dispersed; those who were to fly with=
 the court had the word=20

of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve o'clock t=
o one at Cours la=20

Reine.  At ten o'clock Anne of Austria had entered the king's room. Monsieu=
r had just retired, and=20

the youthful Louis, remaining the last, was amusing himself by placing some=
 lead soldiers in a line=20

of battle, a game which delighted him much. Two royal pages were playing wi=
th him.  "Laporte,"=20

said the queen, "it is time for his majesty to go to bed."  The king asked =
to remain up, having, he=20

said, no wish to sleep; but the queen was firm.  "Are you not going to-morr=
ow morning at six=20

o'clock, Louis, to bathe at Conflans? I think you wished to do so of your o=
wn accord?"  "You are=20

right, madame," said the king, "and I am ready to retire to my room when yo=
u have kissed me.=20

Laporte, give the light to Monsieur the Chevalier de Coislin."  The queen t=
ouched with her lips the=20

white, smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which al=
ready partook of=20

etiquette.  "Go to sleep soon, Louis," said the queen, "for you must be awa=
kened very early."  "I=20

will do my best to obey you, madame," said the youthful king, "but I have n=
o inclination to sleep."=20

"Laporte," said Anne of Austria, in an undertone, "find some very dull book=
 to read to his majesty,=20

but do not undress yourself."  The king went out, accompanied by the Cheval=
ier de Coislin,=20

bearing the candlestick, and then the queen returned to her own apartment. =
Her ladies--that is to=20

say Madame de Bregy, Mademoiselle de Beaumont, Madame de Motteville, and So=
cratine, her=20

sister, so called on account of her sense--had just brought into her dressi=
ng-room the remains of=20

the dinner, on which, according to her usual custom, she supped. The queen =
then gave her=20

orders, spoke of a banquet which the Marquis de Villequier was to give to h=
er on the day after the=20

morrow, indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of =
it, announced another=20

visit on the following day to Val-de-Grace, where she intended to pay her d=
evotions, and gave her=20

commands to her senior valet to accompany her. When the ladies had finished=
 their supper the=20

queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom. Madame de Mottev=
ille, who was on=20

especial duty that evening, followed to aid and undress her. The queen then=
 began to read, and=20

after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes, dismissed her. =
 It was at this moment=20

D'Artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace, in the coadjutor's carriage=
, and a few seconds=20

later the carriages of the ladies-in-waiting drove out and the gates were s=
hut after them.  A few=20

minutes after twelve o'clock Bernouin knocked at the queen's bedroom door, =
having come by the=20

cardinal's secret corridor. Anne of Austria opened the door to him herself.=
 She was dressed, that is=20

to say, in dishabille, wrapped in a long, warm dressing-gown.  "It is you, =
Bernouin," she=20


_
At birth the Auric Egg consists of almost pure Akasha plus the Tanhas, whic=
h, until the seventh=20

year, remain potential or in latency.  The Auric Egg of an idiot cannot be =
said to be human, that is,=20

it is not tinged with Manas. It is Akashic vibrations rather than an Auric =
 "Yes, madame, in your=20

oratory. He is waiting till your majesty is ready."  "I am. Go and tell Lap=
orte to wake and dress the=20

king, and then pass on to the Marechal de Villeroy and summon him to me."  =
Bernouin bowed and=20

retired.  The queen entered her oratory, which was=20


_
material envelope, such as that of the plant, the mineral or other object. =
 The Auric Egg is the=20

transmitter from the periodical lives to the Life eternal, _i.e._, from Pra=
na to Jiva. It disappears, but=20

remains.  The reason why the confession of the Roman Catholic and Greek Chu=
rches is so great=20

a sin is because the confessor interferes with the Auric Egg of the peniten=
t by means of his will=20

power, engrafting artificially emanations from his own Auric Egg and castin=
g seeds for germination=20

into the Auric Egg of his subject. It is on the same lines as hypnotic sugg=
estion.  The above=20

remarks apply Venetian crystal, She saw D'Artagnan, who stood expecting her=
.  "Is it you?" she=20

said.  "Yes, madame."  "Are you ready?"  "I am."  "And his eminence, the ca=
rdinal?"  "Has got off=20

without any accident. He is awaiting your majesty at Cours la Reine."  "But=
 in what carriage do we=20

start?"  "I have provided for everything; a carriage below is waiting for y=
our majesty."  "Let us go to=20

the king."  D'Artagnan bowed and followed the queen. The young Louis was al=
ready dressed, with=20

the exception of his shoes and doublet; he had allowed himself to be dresse=
d, in great=20

astonishment, overwhelming Laporte=20
