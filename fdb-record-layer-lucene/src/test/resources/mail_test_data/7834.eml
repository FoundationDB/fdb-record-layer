"All the same, we ought to keep him in sight," Brad decided. inside outward."  "Just so it is, Mr. Burden," Otto affirmed.

position, when Dan gripped his arm.  "Look, Brad!" he whispered.  The door of the shack had 

opened. For a moment the tramp stood there in his wrinkled clothes, gazing directly toward the 

woods.  "Lie still, fellows!" Brad ordered. "I don't think he sees us."  "What's he going to do next?" 

Dan speculated uneasily.  The tramp stretched himself, and wandering down to the stream, and 

rolled up his sleeves."  "I don't see how he could do it!" grandmother kept saying.  Otto 

misunderstood her. "Why, mam, it was simple enough; he pulled the trigger with his big toe. He 

layed over on his side and put the end of the barrel in his mouth, then he drew up one foot and felt 

for the trigger. He found it all right!"  "Maybe he did," said Jake grimly. "There's

face. After taking a drink, he re-entered the shack.  "I sure hope he stays there," Chips whispered. 

The wish was a futile one. A minute or two later, the tramp reappeared, carrying a few cooking 

utensils.  Turning his back to the Cubs, he followed the curve of the creek and vanished it."  "Now 

what do you mean, Jake?" grandmother asked sharply.  "Well, mam, I found Krajiek's axe under 

the manger, and I picks it up and carries it over to the corpse, and I take my oath it just fit the gash 

in the front of the old man's face. That there Krajiek had been sneakin'

"Is he leaving for good?" whispered Dan.  "I don't think so," Jack Phillips answered. "I've seen him 

cook his food in a rock shelter about a hundred yards down-stream. He doesn't dare have a fire 

inside the shack, or he'd likely burn it down."  "All the same it's our job to keep him in sight until the 

police whimperin', 'My God, man, don't do that!' 'I reckon I'm a-goin' to look into this,' says I. Then 

he begun to squeal like a rat and run about wringin' his hands. 'They'll hang me!' says he. 'My 

God, they'll hang me sure!'"  Fuchs spoke up impatiently. "Krajiek's gone silly, Jake, and so have

soon as you can."  "Sure!" agreed Jack, liking the assignment. "We won't let him get away."  "If he 

should lead you a chase, mark the trail," the Den Chief advised. "Fred knows how to do it so the 

Cubs can follow."  Fred and Jack hastened off in pursuit of the tramp. However, it seemed they 

scarcely had disappeared until they returned murder him, would he? It don't hang together. The 

gun was right beside him when Ambrosch found him."  "Krajiek could 'a' put it there, could n't he?" 

Jake demanded.  Grandmother broke in excitedly: "See here, Jake Marpole, don't you go trying to 

add murder to suicide. We're deep enough in trouble. Otto reads you too many of them detective 

stories."  "It will be easy to decide all that, Emmaline," said grandfather quietly. "If he
