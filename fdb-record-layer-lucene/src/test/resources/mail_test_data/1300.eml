This ought to have been enough to protect the Cherokees in their rights. But it was not, and for 

two reasons: the contempt of Georgia for the Court's opinions, and the refusal of Jackson to 

restrain the State in its headstrong course. Already the state authorities had refused to take notice 

of a writ of error to the Supreme Court sued out in December, 1830, in behalf of a condemned 

Cherokee, Corn Tassel, and had permitted the execution of the unfortunate redskin. The state 

court now refused to issue a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of Worcester, and the prisoner was 

held--precisely as if the law under which he was convicted had been pronounced constitutional--

until he was pardoned by the Governor a year later.  This action on the part of the State was, of 

course, nothing less than nullification. Yet Jackson did not lift a finger. "John Marshall has made 

his decision," he is reported to have said; "now let him enforce it." The South Carolinians were 

quick to seize upon the inconsistencies of the situation. Nullification in their State was apparently 

one thing; in Georgia, quite another. The very fact, however, that the Georgians had successfully 

defied the federal Supreme Court did much to encourage their neighbors in a course of similar 

boldness. Jackson's leniency toward Georgia has never been wholly explained. He was 

undoubtedly influenced by his sympathy with the purpose of the State to establish its jurisdiction 

over all lands within its borders. Furthermore he cherished an antipathy for Marshall which even 

led him to refuse in 1835 to attend a memorial meeting in the great jurist's honor. But these 

considerations do not wholly cover the case. All that the historian can say is that the President 

chose to take notice of the threats and acts of South Carolina and to ignore the threats and acts of 

Georgia, without ever being troubled by the inconsistency of his course. His political career affords 

many such illustrations of the arbitrary and even erratic character of his mind.  Meanwhile the 

great Indian migration was setting in. Emulating the example of Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi 

extended their laws over all of the Indian lands within their boundaries; and in all parts of the South 

the red folk--some of them joyously, but most of them sorrowfully--prepared to take up their long 

journey. In 1832 the Creeks yielded to the United States all of their remaining lands east of the 

Mississippi. By the spring of 1833 the Choctaws and Chickasaws had done the same thing and 

were on their way westward. Only the Cherokees remained, and in his message of December 3, 

1833, Jackson reiterated his earlier arguments for their removal. Realizing that further resistance 

was useless, a portion of the tribe signified its readiness to go. The remainder, however, held out, 

and it was only at the close of 1835 that the long-desired treaty of cession could be secured. All 

Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi were now relinquished to the United States, which agreed 

to pay five million dollars for them, to provide an adequate home in the new Indian Territory 

created by Congress during the preceding year, and to bear all the costs of removing the tribe 

thither.  It was not alone the South, however, that witnessed widespread displacements of Indian 

populations in the Jacksonian period. How the Black Hawk War of 1832 grew out of, and in turn 

led to, removals in the remoter Northwest has been related in another volume in this series.  And, 

in almost every western State, surviving Indian titles were rapidly extinguished. Between 1829 and 

1837 ninety-four Indian treaties, most of them providing for transfers of territory, were concluded; 

and before Jackson went out of office he was able to report to Congress that, "with the exception 

of two small bands living in Ohio and Indiana, not exceeding fifteen hundred persons, and of the 

Cherokees, all of the tribes on the east side of the Mississippi, and extending from Lake Michigan 

to Florida, have entered into engagements which will lead to their transplantation." With little delay 



the Cherokees, too, were added to this list, although a group of irreconcilables resisted until 1838, 

when they were forcibly ejected by a contingent of United States troops under General Winfield 

Scott.   See The Old Northwest, by Frederic Austin Ogg (in The Chronicles of America).  All of this 

was done not without strong protest driven forth by Mahaut, and forgotten in the will of Thierry, 

from whose senile infatuation she had hoped great things, resolved to be avenged on Mahaut. 

She fled from Arras to the service of the ambitious and unscrupulous Jeanne de Valois, sister of 

Philippe VI., and wife of Robert d'Artois.  Jeanne de Divion was full of vague tales of the valuable 

papers belonging to the county of Artois which she had seen in the possession of Thierry, and the 

two women soon saw that some capital could be made for the claims of Robert d'Artois. Robert 

himself seems to have been reluctant, at first, to have any dealings with the degraded paramour of 

Thierry d'Hirecon; in place of vague asseverations of what she had seen among the papers of 

Thierry he demanded the documents themselves, if there were any. It is probable that at the time 

there were no documents; but Jeanne de Divion was resourceful and not too nice in regard to 

matters of conscience. Going to Arras to search among the papers of Thierry, she returned with an 

alleged treaty negotiated in 1281 between the paternal and maternal grand-fathers of Robert, 

under the terms of which the customs of Artois were set aside and the succession guaranteed to 

Philippe d'Artois's children, of whom Robert was the representative.  Robert's scruples were laid at 

rest when this very questionable document, of which nobody had ever heard a word, was put into 

his hands. He wrote to his brother-in-law, now King of France, to demand a new investigation of 

the claims to Artois. Meanwhile, the Countess Mahaut set about collecting testimony in rebuttal, 

aiming especially to show the falsity of the alleged document containing the treaty. She arrested 

two servants of Jeanne de Divion, who testified, in the presence of several witnesses and of a 

notary who took down the depositions, that the treaty in question had been written by one Jacques 

Rondelet, clerk of Arras, at the dictation of Jeanne de Divion, on her recent visit to Arras. 

Moreover, the countess had the wisdom to get these witnesses to testify that they had not been 

coerced by her but testified of their own free will and accord. Then she interrogated Jacques 

Rondelet, who confirmed all that the servants had said, adding that he had written at dictation, and 

under oath of secrecy, from a document which Jeanne de Divion would not let him see.  The 

proofs of the forgery, one would think, were sufficient before the cause came to trial; yet, after a 

statement of the principal allegations on both sides, the king adjourned the hearing to another day. 

But that day was not to dawn for Mahaut. On November 23, 1329, the countess was at Poissy, 

where she dined with the king, going on to the convent of Maubuisson to pass the night, and 

thence to Paris next day. Here she fell suddenly ill; and her own physician, Thomas le Miesier, 

was sent for in all haste from Arras. The crude or dangerous remedies of the medicine of the day 

were powerless to relieve Mahaut; phlebotomy and purgatives probably served but to exhaust her 

already depleted strength, and the physicians recognized that her end was at hand. Couriers rode 

in haste from the Hotel d'Artois in Paris to Queen Jeanne, to the Duke of Burgundy, to the Count 

of Flanders, on the 26th, and as many as three to the king next day, bearing news of the great 

countess's peril. Jeanne came to her mother with all speed, but the end had come before she 

could reach Paris; the good Countess of Artois breathed her last on November 27th.  She who had 

expended considerable sums in the pomp of funerals, tombs, and effigies for others was buried 

very simply, at her own request, in the Abbey of Maubuisson, where her grave was marked at first 



by a plain, flat copper plate, hardly raised above the level of the pavement. In accordance with a 

custom not unusual in her day, the body was opened and the heart taken to the Franciscan 

Church in Paris, where it was interred, as she had directed, _juxta sepulturam Roberti carissimi filii 

mei_--"beside the grave of my very dear son Robert."  Judging from the features of a statue 

representing Mahaut, which was formerly in a church in Arras and was copied in miniature by an 

artist of the seventeenth century, the countess was a woman of large and commanding figure, with 

features rather masculine and strongly marked in their regularity. If one may say so, the sculptor 

has drawn for us Mahaut's character as

CHAPTER XI THE JACKSONIAN SUCCESSION  "Oh, hang General Jackson," exclaimed Fanny 

Kemble one day, after dinner, in the cabin of the ship that brought her, in the summer of 1832, to 

the United States. Even before she set foot on our shores, the brilliant English actress was tired of 

the din of politics and bored by the incessant repetition of the President's name. Subsequently she 

was presented at the White House and had an opportunity to form her own opinion of the 

"monarch" whose name and deeds were on everybody's lips; and the impression was by no 

means unfavorable. "Very tall and thin he was," says her journal, "but erect and dignified; a good 

specimen of a fine old, well-battered soldier; his manners perfectly simple and quiet, and, 

therefore, very good."  Small wonder that the name of Jackson was heard wherever men and 

women congregated in 1832! Something more than half of the people of the country were at the 

moment type, strong and energetic rather than lovable. For a woman who would hold her own in 

those days, the qualities she possessed were, in fact, essential; to rule Artois in the fourteenth 

century there was need of an amazon rather than of a lovely, fragile, soft-hearted daughter of love. 

We do not mean that Mahaut was cold, heartless, merely a politician; she was far better both in 

morals and in kindness of heart than the average lady of her time. She was generous, and yet not 

a hopeless spendthrift; she was pious and devoted to the glorious memory of her great-uncle Saint 

Louis, whom she must have seen when a child, and yet not a narrow bigot, displaying her religious 

feeling rather in acts of charity than in acts of pure devotion. No niche awaits her among the 

heroines of France, for she is a figure neither heroic nor romantic; but she lived her life, the full, 

healthy, and useful life of a stirring and good lady of the manor in 


_
Frail health and close application to official duties prevented Jackson from traveling extensively 

during his eight years in the White House. He saw the Hermitage but once in this time, and on but 

one occasion did he venture far from the capital. This was in the summer of 1833, when he toured 

the Middle States and New England northward as far as Concord, New Hampshire. Accompanied 

by Van Buren, Lewis Cass, Levi Woodbury, and other men of prominence, the President set off 

from Washington in early June. At     CHAPTER IX  JEANNE DE MONTFORT  WE are now 

coming to a period in the history of France when woman, though she may not play a part either 

more prominent or more honorable, will be a centre of universal interest to the subjects of France 

and of England. Much ink and much fluid of a brighter hue and a more precious quality will be 

shed in the war between the lawyers and the soldiers of France on the one hand, and those of 

England on the other; and all to establish the legal status of woman in the eyes of the

New England was, in the main, enemy country. None the less, the President was received there 

with unstinted goodwill. Edward Everett said that only two other men had ever been welcomed in 

Boston as Jackson was. They were Washington and La Fayette. The President's determined 

stand against nullification was fresh in mind, and the people, regardless of party, were not slow to 

express their appreciation. Their cordiality was fully reciprocated. "He is amazingly tickled with 

great question is: Shall the succession to the crown of France be governed by the laws and 

customs prevailing in many other countries and in a large part of France itself, whereby women 

are entitled to inherit equally with men; or shall the ancient law of the Salian Franks apply, the _Loi 

Salique_, "let no part of the Salian land pass into the hands of a woman"? Since the question has 

been argued by many a scholiast and many a historian and settled for all time by the
