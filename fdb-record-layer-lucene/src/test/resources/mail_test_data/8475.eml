eek stucco-workers not only employ these methods to make their works durabl=
e, but also construct a mortar trough, mix the lime and sand in it, bring o=
n a gang of men, and beat the stuff with wooden beetles, and do not use it =
until it has been thus vigorously worked. Hence, some cut in them. When he =
takes a glass from Katya, or listens to her speaking, or looks after her as=

fade but are permanent. This is because the lime, having had its moisture b=
urned out in the kiln,=20

becomes porous and loses its strength, and its dryness makes it take up any=
thing that may come=20

in contact with it. On mixing with the seeds or elements that come from oth=
er substances, it forms=20

a solid mass with them and, no matter what the constituent parts may then b=
e, it must, obviously,=20

on becoming dry, possess the qualities which are peculiar to its own nature=
.  8. Hence, stucco that=20

is properly made does not get rough as time goes on, nor lose its colours w=
hen it is wiped off,=20

unless they have been laid on with little care and after it is dry. So, whe=
n the stucco on walls is=20

made as described above, it will have strength and brilliancy, and an excel=
lence that will last to a=20

great age. But when only one coat of sand mortar and one of fine marble hav=
e been spread on, its=20

thin layer is easily cracked from want of strength, and from its lack of th=
ickness it will not take on=20

the brilliance, due to polishing, which it ought to have.  9. Just as a is =
trying to say. The deadly=20

dulness is awful, the very flies expire. It can only be compared with the b=
oredom in the assembly-

hall at the yearly meeting when the traditional address is read--damn it!" =
 And at once an abrupt=20

transition:  "Three years ago--Nikolay Stepanovitch here will remember it--=
I had to deliver that=20

address. It was hot, stifling, my uniform cut me under the arms--it was dea=
dly! I read for half an=20

hour, for an hour, for an hour and a half, for two hours.... 'Come,' I thou=
ght; 'thank God, there are=20

only ten pages left!' And at the end there were four pages that there was n=
o need to read, and I=20

reckoned to leave them out. 'So there are only six really,' I thought; 'tha=
t is, only six pages left to=20

read.' But, only fancy, I chanced to glance before me, and, sitting in the =
front row, side by side,=20

were a general with a ribbon on his breast and a bishop. The poor beggars w=
ere numb with=20

boredom; they were staring with their eyes wide open to keep awake, and yet=
 they were trying to=20

put on an expression of attention and to pretend=20


_
indistinctly and with a feeble light, while one that is substantially made =
can take on a very high=20

polish, and reflects a brilliant and distinct image when one looks therein,=
 so it is with stucco. When=20

the stuff of which it is formed is thin, it not only cracks but also soon f=
ades; when, however, it has a=20

solid foundation of sand mortar and of marble, thickly and compactly applie=
d, it is not only brilliant=20

after being subjected to repeated polishings, but also reflects from was sa=
ying and liked it. 'Well,' I=20

thought, 'since you like it you shall have it! I'll pay you out;' so I just=
 gave them those four pages=20

too."  As is usual with ironical people, when he talks nothing in his face =
smiles but his eyes and=20

eyebrows. At such times there is no trace of hatred or spite in his eyes, b=
ut a great deal of=20

humour, and that peculiar fox-like slyness which is only to be noticed in v=
ery observant people.=20

Since I am speaking about his eyes, I notice=20
