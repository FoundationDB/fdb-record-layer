on. Then about Primrose--may I be quite honest with you about Primrose?"  "=
Oh yes, my dear."=20

"Well now, she doesn't write well--not really--her hand moves so slowly, an=
d I have seen some=20

spelling mistakes now and then in her letters--I fly over the page myself, =
but then I only can read=20

my own writing. I am greatly afraid that poor Mr. Ellsworthy would find Pri=
mrose a bad secretary.=20

No, no, no; ours is a much, much better plan. You see, Mrs. Ellsworthy, you=
 must not be angry=20

with us--we love you very much--we are greatly obliged to you, but we have =
quite made up our=20

minds--we will not be separated. Ah! here comes Primrose. Primrose, darling=
, here is Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy--she is just going to listen to our plan--she has told us hers, =
and I have been explaining=20

to her that it will not answer, for Daisy and I are determined not to go to=
 school, and you know,=20

Primrose, you are really stupid with your pen."  "How do you do, Mrs. Ellsw=
orthy?" said Primrose--

she came in looking fagged and tired, and with a worried expression between=
 her eyebrows. "Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy," she said, "I am most grateful to you for being so kind to us. =
I know you won't approve=20

at all of our plan--you will agree with Mr. Danesfield, who said he thought=
 we had taken leave of=20

our senses, but I think we have made up our minds, and as we have no guardi=
an, there is no one=20

to prevent us doing as we please."  "Oh, Primrose, how sad you look!" said =
Jasmine. "Has Mr.=20

Danesfield been disagreeable to you? Well, I know our darling Mrs. Ellswort=
hy won't. Tell her our=20

plan quickly. Primrose, she says you don't love her--tell her you do love h=
er. Oh, she is sweet and=20

dear and kind--tell her our plan--she won't throw cold water on what we wis=
h to do--she won't think=20

it wrong that we three girls should wish to keep together."  "Our plan is t=
his," said Primrose, "I have=20

asked Mr. Danesfield to give us what money he has of ours, and then we thre=
e are going to sell=20

our furniture here, and to give up the cottage, and say good-bye to dear Ha=
nnah, and we are=20

going to London. In London we shall learn. I am going to have lessons in pa=
inting, and Jasmine=20

shall study English composition, and she shall be taught how to write prope=
rly; and Daisy, too,=20

must be taught, and we will do that with our money which is now in the bank=
, and when it is spent=20

we shall be able to support ourselves. After all, it is a very simple plan,=
 and the best thing about it=20

is that it will keep us together."  When Primrose began to talk Mrs. Ellswo=
rthy threw down her=20

hands in her lap with a Father is so kind and good, and so are you, and yet=
 you are never able to=20

agree. Why is it?" she implored.  "Too much alike, I cal'late. But honest, =
Beth, I ain't got nothing=20

particular against your father, and if I had I'd sink my feelings to Davy's=
 locker for your sake. The=20

trouble is, I've been expecting too much, and I ain't got any right to ask =
your father to put himself=20

out for an old hulk like me."  "What sheer nonsense! I've half a mind to sc=
old you. Of course,=20

Father is willing to put himself out for you. Only this morning he said he =
would do all in his power=20

to get a ship for you to command."  "He's said something like that to me, t=
oo, several times."=20

"Then he'll do it, if you will only be patient. Father always keeps his wor=
d."  "You ain't seen the new=20

parson yet, have you?" asked the seaman, anxious to change a dangerous subj=
ect.  "How could I,=20

when I've just reached home? Father tells me he is a real Prince Charming,"=
 she finished, with a=20

wicked little laugh.  "Humph!"  "Is he, really, Uncle Josiah?"  "He ain't s=
o bad on looks, if that's=20

what you're driving at."  "Father says he must be very strong, too."  "I ca=
l'late he ain't lacking on=20

that p'int, neither," agreed the Captain, blinking his swollen eyelids.  El=
izabeth laughed heartily.=20

"Oh! By the way, what did you and your handsome minister do to Father last =
night?"  "Is your pa=20

ailing, too?"  "He says he is quite lame, and when I asked him what the mat=
ter was, he only=20

smiled, and told me to find out from you. Did your minister take him for a =
burglar, too?"  "Is that all=20



your father said about it?"  "Yes, except that it was his own fault."  Capt=
ain Pott chuckled. "I feared=20

he wa'n't going to see it that way last night. Eadie Beaver put the parson =
in here while I was in the=20

city on a special trip. She came over the day I left last week, and said it=
 would be real nice if he=20

could live with me and eat with her. I told her I'd see about shipping a pa=
rson in my house,=20

meaning I'd have nothing to do with him. Well, she went ahead and bunked hi=
m here, thinking I'd=20

meant it was all right. It 'pears she done it against your father's ideas, =
too. So he come over last=20

night and tried to get Mr. McGowan to move out. That made me madder than wh=
at Eadie had=20

done, so I asked him right then if he was willing to stay. He said he was. =
Your pa got sore, and=20

started real dignified to go home. The candle that Mr. McGowan had been usi=
ng was on the floor,=20

and your pa's heel hit it. His cane went up and he went down. His high hat =
took a swim in a bucket=20

of=20


_
dry voice, "May I ask what money you have in the bank?"  "Yes, certainly--w=
e have two hundred=20

pounds--a little of that must be spent in paying one or two small accounts,=
 but then we shall have=20

the money as well from the sale of our furniture. Yes, I think we shall hav=
e quite two hundred=20

pounds to take to London."  "And we are going to be very economical," inter=
posed Jasmine. "We=20

are going at first for a couple of nights to a boarding-house for ladies on=
ly. It is called Penelope=20

Mansion, and is in a street off the Edgware Road--we have a friend, she is =
only a village girl, but=20

we call her our friend--her name is Poppy Jenkins, who has just gone to Pen=
elope Mansion to help=20

her aunt, who is the owner of the boarding-house. While we are there we wil=
l see the sights, for of=20

course that must be part of our education. We will go to Westminster Abbey =
to be solemnized, and=20

we will go to the Tower to perfect our knowledge of the tragical part of En=
glish the parson had=20

been using to swab decks with."  "Father is so very dignified! It must have=
 been quite funny," she=20

commented, between paroxysms of laughter. "I wish I could have seen him!"  =
"'Twas a mite funny.=20

I fished his beaver out the pail, and he made off holding it away from him =
like it was p'ison."=20

Sudden seriousness on the part of the girl caused the Captain to look in th=
e direction of her gaze.=20

A tall young man had emerged from the back door of the house, pail in hand.=
 He came hurriedly=20

toward the well.  "That's him," confirmed the seaman in answer to a look fr=
om Elizabeth.  "He? A=20

minister?"  "You see now why I wa'n't strong enough to throw him out, don't=
 you? I cal'late Eadie=20

Beaver would say the Lord took my strength away, but the Lord don't need to=
 give that feller a=20

hand. He's a hull host to himself."  "He doesn't look in the least like one=
," declared Elizabeth.  "He=20

doesn't? Why, his arm is as big----"  "No, no! I mean he doesn't=20
