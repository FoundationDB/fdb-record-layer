competent teachers. Consequently the education of their children had been e=
xceedingly irregular,=20

deficient, and onerous. The School Society had done nothing for these insti=

The results gave general satisfaction for a while. But as it was a time whe=
n much was being done=20

to develop the public schools of New England, the colored people of Hartfor=
d could not remain=20

contented. They saw the white pupils housed in comfortable buildings and at=
tending properly=20

graded classes, while their own children continued to be crowded into small=
 insanitary rooms and=20

taught as unclassified students. The Negroes, therefore, petitioned for a m=
ore suitable building=20

and a better organization of their schools. As this request came at the tim=
e when the abolitionists=20

were working hard to exterminate caste from the schools of New England, the=
 School up a pair of=20

scissors, and began to rip off some antiquated trimming from the sleeve.  C=
l=C3=A9mence felt almost as=20

if a living thing she loved was being hurt. Tears quivered in her eyes, and=
 the colour rose to her=20

cheek as she laid her hand on her mother=E2=80=99s arm. =E2=80=9CMother, li=
sten to me,=E2=80=9D she pleaded. =E2=80=9CDo not=20

ould go to mass on=20

Sundays looking like a princess, while the few who know of our existence kn=
ow also that we have=20

scarcely bread to eat from day to day? Is it suitable? And besides, dear mo=
ther,=E2=80=9D she continued=20

timidly, =E2=80=9Cyou know I do not love gay clothing. I do not think it be=

unworthily, still desires and endeavours to lead a religious life.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CBe as religious as you please, my=20

 she does=20

Committee called a meeting of the memorialists to decide whether they desir=

children to the white or separate schools.[1] They decided in favor of the =
latter, provided that the=20

colored people should have a building adequate to their needs and instructi=
on of the best kind.[2]=20
