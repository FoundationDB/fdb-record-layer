 honoured the one, while Stacey Dodd clung lovingly to the arm of any word =
processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or distribu=
te copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than "Plain Vani=
lla ASCII" or other _
attired, at least half-a-dozen times, to submit themselves to old Warrender=
's inspection in the=20

drawing-room quite half-an-hour before the carriages drew up at the door to=
 take them to the=20

church.  Georgie was not sufficiently old-fashioned to be married in a bonn=
et. Even a plain girl=20

looks well in white, and Georgie was not a plain girl by any means. Of cour=
se, according to all=20

proper precedent she ought to have rushed into her father's arms, and with =
floods of tears have=20

bid him a touching farewell. What she did do, however, as she entered the r=
oom, was to rapidly=20

advance and affectionately embrace him, then she stepped back and dropped h=
im a low courtesy.=20

"Shall I do, papa?" she said with a loving smile.  "My dear, you're a credi=
t to all of us," said the old=20

gentleman, and her appearance certainly justified the ecstatic looks of Mis=
s Hood, the four=20

bridesmaids, and the young person from the West End.  Georgie was fully con=
scious of her=20

privileges. No woman can twice in her life dress in white satin and orange =
blossoms, and if she=20

mars the effect by the regulation tears, it is quite certain that there mus=
t be a screw loose=20

somewhere. There was a great deal of tittering, smiling, and blushing; but =
the squire glanced at=20

the clock, Lucy handed the bridal bouquet to her cousin, then the squire ga=
ve his daughter his=20

arm, and, preceded by the bridesmaids, the little procession entered the ca=
rriages, and five=20

minutes' drive brought them to the church.  Haggard, when he cast his eyes =
upon Georgie=20

Warrender, seemed to regain his composure at once; there must have been a t=
errible amount of=20

forwardness about this young lady, for according to rule and the pictures i=
n the illustrated papers,=20

her eyes should have been fixed upon the ground; and as the latest etiquett=
e book says, "the bride=20

should only acknowledge the bridegroom's presence by an assumption of shrin=
king timidity=20

suitable to the occasion." But the bride smiled at Haggard, and so did the =
vicar, and so did the four=20

bridesmaids.  The Reverend John Dodd didn't take long in tying the knot. Th=
e village organist had=20

distinguished himself by his florid rendering of the Wedding March. As Lord=
 Spunyarn gave his=20

arm to Lucy Warrender, he almost felt as if he had been married himself, an=
d that it was a rather=20

pleasant process than otherwise.  "It's rather rough on us, Miss Warrender,=
 having to play second=20

fiddle," he said, while they were standing in the vestry during the signing=
 of the register.  "Well, we=20

can look upon it as a dress rehearsal, Lord Spunyarn; but we mustn't forget=
 that it is a solemn=20

moment, for I see that Mrs. Dodd is looking this way."  The bells were clas=
hing merrily from the=20

village spire as the party passed out of the church porch. As Haggard hande=
d his wife into the=20

carriage, she appeared still lost to all sense of the proprieties, for she =
nodded and smiled in every=20

direction at the King's Warren villagers, among whom she had grown up; even=
 poor Blogg, the=20

poacher, and his hoyden daughter, Jemima Ann, were not unnoticed. And the p=
atriarchal blessing=20

of the village veteran, "Master" Jasper, as he was called (who had represen=
ted King's Warren on=20

the field of glory some five-and-forty years before, and stood bobbing his =
palsied head, arrayed in=20

his holiday garment, a linen ephod or smock frock, to which his Waterloo me=
dal was proudly=20

affixed), was given heartily enough. "God bless 'ee, Missy," cried the old =
man in the shrill cracked=20

voice of age, as he pressed up to the carriage window.  "Thank you, Jasper,=
" said the girl with a=20

sunny smile. Strange to say, those two words gave the old fellow more pleas=
ure than the thought=20

of the unlimited potations he knew he would enjoy that afternoon at the squ=
ire's expense.  The=20

wedding breakfast very much resembled the similar festivities at which most=
 of us have assisted.=20

The usual speeches were made, nobody seemed very much inclined to eat, but =
everybody's=20

health was drunk; and I think it was rather a relief to all present when yo=
ung Mrs. Haggard=20



appeared in travelling dress, ready to quit, for the first time in her life=
, the happy home of her=20

childhood. Then, and then only, did the young person from the West End mill=
inery establishment=20

remove the pins from her mouth, which enabled her to swallow a much needed =
glass of sherry;=20

and then the squire's voice failed him, and he saw his daughter rather diml=
y as he pressed her to=20

his heart for the last time upon the steps. The bridesmaids relieved their =
feelings by many salutes=20

and much tittering. As the carriage moved off there was a perfect shower of=
 satin slippers, and it=20

wasn't till it got quite out of King's Warren village that the bride was ab=
le to leave off bowing and=20

kissing her hand to her numerous well-wishers.  Then the wedding party brok=
e up into little groups=20

in the garden; at first they didn't amalgamate; the men smoked, and came to=
 the universal=20

conclusion that Haggard was a lucky beggar; while the ladies talked over th=
e interesting details of=20

the ceremony. Old Warrender retired to his study in a rather excited frame =
of mind, excusing=20

himself on the ground of his age.  And now everybody turned out with a feel=
ing of intense relief to=20

witness the rejoicings on the village green. The school children were there=
 enjoying rustic games=20

in a somewhat half-hearted manner, for they had partaken with the appetites=
 of young boa=20

constrictors of the squire's hospitality, and each of them had a brand new =
shilling or half-crown in=20

his or her pocket, according to age. A cricket-match was in progress, but t=
he bowling and batting=20

were extremely wild, thanks to The Warren strong beer. But soon the Rev. Jo=
hn Dodd imparted=20

fresh vigour into the proceedings. The youths and maids pulled themselves t=
ogether on his=20

approach; the more bibulous among the men left the proximity of the big bar=
rels of strong ale, over=20

which the squire's head gardener was presiding. Lovers, who had been promen=
ading arm-in-arm,=20

separated for the moment by mutual consent, the swains touched their forelo=
cks to the vicar, while=20

s gone to fetch _it_," she=20

said.  At that moment the sound of a fiddle was heard, and the smiling rasc=
al who played it,=20

stopping his melody for an instant, made a low and sweeping bow, which took=
 in the vicar, the=20

squire and the gentry generally. Then he clapped his fiddle under his chin =
and without more ado=20

struck up "Bobbing Joan."  "That's right, my man," said the vicar, "you cou=
ldn't do better. Now=20

men, now girls."  But not one of them stirred.  "Goodness me!" cried the vi=
car, and then he forgot=20

himself. Could Mrs. Dodd believe her eyes? Her husband seized Jemima Ann Bl=
ogg by the hand.=20

"Come, gentlemen, set them a good example," he said, and he commenced to tu=
rn Miss Blogg=20

violently round. Before her father had got through another two bars of "Bob=
bing Joan," every soul=20

on the green had commenced to gyrate, the frown died off Mrs. Dodd's face, =
as she too began to=20

encircled by his aged though still vigorous arm. Lord Spunyarn pounced upon=

with one accord to the fine old tune of "Bobbing Joan." Once started there =
