=80=9D  So the British institution arose, small at first, but mighty in its=
 work since. Ten years after, in 1850, it was reorganized, and improved lif=
e-boats secured. The importance of the work may be imagined when we record =
that from 1852 to 1871, the wrecks on British coasts _
would have it. The wretch had the brutal audacity to say to this unfortunat=
e woman in his power,=20

"You have more to suffer by exposure than I have; and look out, if you don'=
t let me have the=20

money." This amount the wretched woman could not procure. She had about a w=
eek previously=20

supplied him with a like sum, and his demands upon her had of late been so =
heavy that she had=20

been in daily apprehension her husband would discover the malversation of t=
he funds he had=20

supplied her with to keep his house. Bills which she professed to have paid=
 remained unsatisfied.=20

Several hundreds of pounds had been diverted from their legitimate applicat=
ion. She had,=20

therefore, on this occasion, as she had done on some other occasions when s=
imilarly situated,=20

given him the material by which, through the pawnbroker, or in some such mo=
de, he might raise=20

the money he required for his unhallowed purposes; and be once more extract=
ed, through his=20

criminal hold over the mind, conscience, and body of the wife, the cash to =
expend in debauchery.=20

The watch and chain, and some other trinkets, had been given by the wife to=
 her paramour, and=20

by him disposed of.  The effect which this letter produced upon the merchan=
t may be more easily=20

conceived than described. It is enough to say that this tolerably strong-mi=
nded man, who had so=20

well played his part throughout the interview I have at such length describ=
ed, here broke down,=20

completely unnerved. He put himself under my guidance, and quitted the hous=
e with me that=20

evening, leaving Mrs. Green therein--alone.  Mr. Green and I had a meeting =
on the following day=20

at the office of his solicitor, to whom I handed a copy of the letter; and =
I also supplied a copy to the=20

attorney for the prisoner. It was arranged between Mr. Green's solicitor an=
d his client that a person=20

should be sent up to take immediate possession of the house at Kentish Town=
, which he had=20

evacuated on the previous night.  The man, on his arrival there, discovered=
 that Mrs. Green had=20

fled. She took her departure early that morning. She left no article behind=
 that was easy of=20

removal. A somewhat extensive wardrobe was packed in boxes. All the article=
s of jewelry, that=20

were easily convertible into money, she also took. Mr. Green had, at my sug=
gestion, left her ten=20

cheques, drawn upon his private bankers, for 5_l._ each, and each post-date=
d seven days apart.=20

These, of course, she took with her. She left no address behind her. She to=
ok neither of the=20

servants for companionship. Whither she had gone to nobody knew, nor did I =
care.  There was a=20

meeting between the solicitor for the prosecutor and the solicitor for the =
prisoner--in confidence,=20

and without prejudice.  Communications were, under this shield, freely exch=
anged. The poor girl=20

was told that an application would be made for her release, when next taken=
 before the=20

magistrate, under circumstances that would be afterwards explained to her. =
She was further=20

informed that her master was confident of her innocence; that the guilty pe=
rson had been traced,=20

but would not be prosecuted. For the injury she had received at his hands, =
which he was sorry to=20

confess was the consequence of his rash impulses, he asked her forgiveness,=
 which she readily=20

granted him.  At the next examination before the magistrate the prosecutor'=
s solicitor, who=20

appeared for the first time, said that the case had been investigated since=
 the former meeting, and=20

that he would ask his worship's permission to be allowed to withdraw from t=
he prosecution. The=20

magistrate at once turned to the prisoner's solicitor, asked whether he had=
 any portion of the=20

wreck away; for, as the ship, which was broadside on, turned towards us in =
her rolling, I plainly=20

descried her people at work with axes, especially one active figure with lo=
ng curling hair,=20

conspicuous among the rest.  =E2=80=9CBut a great cry, which was audible ev=
en above the wind=20

[Illustration: HOVELLERS RELIEVING A VESSEL.]  and water, rose from the sho=
re at this=20



moment; the sea, sweeping over the rolling wreck, made a clean breach, and =
carried men, spars,=20

casks, planks, bulwarks--heaps of such toys--into the boiling surge. The se=
cond mast was yet=20

standing, with the rags of a rent sail, and a wild confusion of broken cord=
age flapping to and fro.=20

The ship had struck once, the same boatman hoarsely said in my ear, and the=
n lifted in and struck=20

again.  =E2=80=9CAs he spoke, there was another great cry of pity from the =
beach; four men arose with the=20

wreck out of the deep, clinging to the rigging of the remaining mast; upper=
most, the active figure=20

with the curling hair. There was a bell on board; and, as the ship rolled a=
nd dashed, like a=20

desperate creature driven mad, now showing us the whole sweep of her deck, =
as she turned on=20

her beam-ends towards the shore, now, nothing but her keel, as she sprung w=
ildly over and turned=20

towards the sea, the bell rang; and its sound, the knell of those unhappy m=
en, was borne towards=20

us on the wind.  =E2=80=9CAgain, we lost her, and again she rose. Two men w=
ere gone. The agony on=20

shore increased. Men groaned and clasped their hands, women shrieked and tu=
rned away their=20

faces. Some ran wildly up and down along the beach, crying for help where n=
o help could be. I=20

found myself one of these, frantically imploring a knot of sailors whom I k=
new, not to let those two=20

lost creatures perish before our eyes, when I noticed that some new sensati=
on moved the people=20

on the beach, and saw them part, and Ham come breaking through them to the =
front.  =E2=80=9CI ran to=20

him, held him back with both arms and implored the men with whom I had been=
 speaking not to=20

listen to him, not to do murder, not to let him stir from off that sand! An=
other cry arose on shore,=20

and, looking to the wreck, we saw the cruel sail, with blow on blow, beat o=
ff the lower of the two=20

men, and fly up in triumph round the active figure left alone upon the mast=
.  =E2=80=9CAgainst such a sight,=20

and against such determination as that of the calmly desperate man, I might=
 as hopefully have=20

entreated the wind. =E2=80=98Mas=E2=80=99r Davy,=E2=80=99 he said, cheerily=
 grasping me by both hands, =E2=80=98if my time is come,=20

=E2=80=99tis come. If =E2=80=99tain=E2=80=99t, I=E2=80=99ll bide it. Lord a=
bove bless you, and bless all! Mates, make me ready! I=E2=80=99m a-

going off!=E2=80=99  =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t know what I answered, or what=
 they rejoined; but I saw a hurry on the beach,=20

and men running with ropes from a capstan that was there, and penetrating i=
nto a circle of figures=20

that hid him from me. Then I saw him standing alone, in a seaman=E2=80=99s =
frock and trousers, a rope in=20

his hand, or slung to his wrist; another round his body, and several of the=
 best men, holding, at a=20

little distance, to the latter, which he laid out himself, slack upon the s=
hore, at his feet.  =E2=80=9CHam=20

watched the sea, standing alone, with the silence of suspended breath behin=
d him, and the storm=20

before, until there was a great retiring wave, when, with a backward glance=
 at those who held the=20

rope which was made fast round his body, he dashed in after it, and, in a m=
oment was buffeting=20

with the water. Now, he made for the wreck, rising with the hills, falling =
with the valleys, lost=20

beneath the rugged foam, borne in towards the shore, borne on towards the s=
hip, striving hard and=20

valiantly.  =E2=80=9CThe=20


_
had no objection to her release without conditions.  The poor girl was acco=
rdingly liberated, and=20

taken away under the care of a relative, in whose hands means were placed f=
or her immediate=20

comfortable provision. Mr. Green provided those means.  Of Mrs. Green I hav=
e since heard.=20

Indeed I had another engagement to trace her, the clue to which was furnish=
ed by herself. She=20

employed an attorney about two months after her flight from Kentish Town, w=
ho waited upon the=20

private solicitor of her husband, and implored him, on the ground of humani=
ty, to let her have=20

money. The advocate begged him to think of the discredit that would attach =
to Mr. Green if the=20

woman who bore his name were reduced to distress, absolute privation, and p=
erhaps the=20

workhouse. After several consultations with his solicitor, Mr. Green declin=
ed to allow any thing. He=20

professed a total unconcern as to what became of the worthless woman; and i=
n reply to a menace,=20

then delicately put forward or hinted by her legal adviser, that she would =
be a source of annoyance=20

to her husband, Mr. Green's solicitor informed his professional friend that=
 his client would not=20

scruple to hand her over to the police if she did so. So ended the negotiat=
ion.  Some time had=20

rolled away since the liberation of the prisoner. Mr. Green continued to ta=
ke considerable interest=20

in her welfare. He frequently visited the residence of her aunt, at Camberw=
ell, and betrayed an=20

almost tender solicitude about the girl. In fact tender is the right part o=
f speech to use as the=20

qualification of solicitude in this case.  The merchant called upon his sol=
icitor one day, and had a=20

long conference with him. Without taking the reader through from the beginn=
ing to the end of that=20

private conference, I may inform him that Mr. Green was determined that Sir=
 Cresswell Cresswell=20

should rend asunder the bonds which had been forged by Hymen or the Church-=
of-England=20

minister, if legal evidence of the infidelity of his wife could be produced=
, and he imagined there=20

would be very little trouble in getting it. The letter which had been disco=
vered in the piano would of=20

course be very important, but was not sufficient in itself.  I was accordin=
gly employed, and=20

following up such traces as I apprehended would lead me on her track. I was=
 not a great while=20

before I discovered that Mrs. Green had become "one more unfortunate" strif=
e deadly. At length,=20

he neared the wreck. He was so near that with one more of his vigorous stro=
kes he would be=20

clinging to it--when a high, green, vast hill-side of water, moving on, sho=
reward, from beyond the=20

ship, he seemed to leap up into it with a mighty bound, and the ship was go=
ne!  =E2=80=9COn running to the=20

spot where they were hauling in,  [Illustration: THE LIFE-BOAT.]  I saw som=
e eddying fragments in=20

the sea, as if a mere cask had been broken. Consternation was in every face=
. They drew him to=20

my very feet--insensible--dead--beaten to death by the great wave; and his =
generous heart was=20

stilled forever.=E2=80=9D  Such things weighed heavily upon the humanely di=
sposed; and when a century=20

ago Mr. Greathead, who had a great heart, stood at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and s=
aw man after man=20

drop from a great wreck into a raging sea without the possibility of rescue=
, he set himself to work=20

upon the problem of the life-boat. Noticing that the half of a circular woo=
den bowl invariably turned=20

concave side upward, when thrown in the water, it occurred to him at once t=
hat a boat with a=20

curved instead of straight keel would always right itself. Wouldhave, at th=
e same time was=20

advocating padding the boat heavily with cork: and the first life-boat was =
constructed from these=20

ideas. A year or two later, a minister in the Orkneys suggested that all bo=
ats could be made self-

righting by fixing an empty water-tight cask in either end. So the idea of =
air-chambers developed:=20

and later the curved keel was made of iron, to aid in ballasting the craft:=
 so that the modern life-

boat, with curved iron keel, cork padding, air chambers, and tubes to permi=
t water to flow out,=20



cannot be sunk, or made to float bottom up. The men may sometimes be washed=
 out of it, or a=20

side stove in, but the boat will always be found right side up.  Strange as=
 it may appear, though the=20

first life-boat, with its crudities, saved hundreds of lives within a few y=
ears, the Government took=20

no steps to institute a general system or life-saving service. To the avera=
ge American, this seems=20

striking; but governments a century ago were more concerned about the succe=
ss in war than=20

about the welfare of the masses; they studied destruction of life more than=
 its preservation: and if=20

perchance, some ruler affected peculiar concern for the welfare of =E2=80=
=9Cthe State,=E2=80=9D it was generally the=20

case that the=20


_
Waterloo Place every night, at present decked in the garments which Mr. Gre=
en, her husband, had=20

purchased; and I further learnt that, out of the proceeds of her sin, she w=
as maintaining "the prior=20

attachment."  When all this evidence had been collected and laid before Dr.=
 Jinks, a very=20

accomplished lawyer, as I have seen cause to know, who practises in the cou=
rt till recently=20

presided over so ably by Sir Cresswell Cresswell; and when his opinion had =
been written upon "a=20

case," to the effect that there was no doubt the court would grant Mr. Gree=
n a divorce from his=20

adulterous wife,--that gentleman called upon Eliza's aunt, and explained to=
 her that he felt bound=20

to mark at once his sense of the merit and virtues of her niece, and his de=
sire to make the amplest=20

reparation in his power for the injuries inflicted upon her, by offering to=
 place her in the position of=20

her late mistress as soon as the legal ceremonies clearing the way had been=
 effected.  The court=20

readily granted a divorce. The opposition on the wife's part  But Sir Willi=
am Hillary and Thomas=20

Wilson made earnest appeals to Parliament for the establishment of a nation=
al life-saving=20

institution; and Hillary added the more effective argument of many deeds of=
 personal daring in the=20

venturous work. Between 1821-1846, no fewer than one hundred and forty-four=
 wrecks occurred=20

on the Isle of Man, and =E2=80=9Cone hundred and seventy-two lives were los=
t; while the destruction of=20

property was estimated at a quarter of a million. In 1825, when the _City o=
f Glasgow_ steamer=20

was stranded in Douglas Bay, Sir William Hillary assisted in saving the liv=
es of sixty-two persons;=20

and in the same year eleven men from the brig _Leopard_, and nine from the =
sloop _Fancy_,=20

which became a total wreck. In 1827-32, Sir William, accompanied by his son=
, saved many other=20

lives; but his greatest success was on the 20th of November, 1830, when he =
saved in the life-boat=20

twenty-two men, the whole of the crew of the mail steamer _St. George_, whi=
ch became a total=20

wreck on St. Mary=E2=80=99s Rock. On this occasion he was=20
