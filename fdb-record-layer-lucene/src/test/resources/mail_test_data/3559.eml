 you don't know much=20

about in these parts. I have never felt it here.  MRS. ALVING. Not when you=

OSWALD. Not when I'm at home. But you don't understand that.  MRS. ALVING. =
Yes, yes; I think=20

I almost understand it--now.  OSWALD. And then, too, the joy of work! At bo=

thing. But that, too, you know nothing about.  MRS. ALVING. Perhaps you are=
 right. Tell me more=20

about it, Oswald.  OSWALD. I only mean that here people are brought up to b=

the colonel had mounted, General Lee drew up his reins, and, with the colon=

and followed by the orderly, moved at a slow walk across the yard toward th=

Grant came out of the house, crossed the porch, and passed down the steps i=

time he was nearly forty-two years of age, of middle height, not over-weigh=

to make it one.=20

OSWALD. But in the great world people won't hear of such things. There, nob=
ody really believes=20

such doctrines any longer. There, you feel it a positive bliss and ecstasy =
merely to draw the breath=20

of life. Mother, have you noticed that everything I have painted has turned=
 upon the joy of life?--

always, always upon the joy of life?--light and sunshine and glorious air a=

happiness. That is why I'm afraid of remaining at home with you.  MRS. ALVI=

you afraid of here, with me?  OSWALD. I'm afraid lest all my instincts shou=

ugliness.  MRS. ALVING. [Looks steadily at him.] Do you think that is what =
would happen?=20
