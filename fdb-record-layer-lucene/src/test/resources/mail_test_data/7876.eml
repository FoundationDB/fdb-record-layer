Except for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project 

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and

more violent than is necessary to destroy life; murderers more than suicides.  Putrefaction may

SIMULATED.  The question whether a case of strangulation is accidental, suicidal, or homicidal is 

very difficult to answer.  ACCIDENTAL strangulation is rare. If the body has not been disturbed, 

there is usually no difficulty in arriving at a conclusion; but if disturbed a satisfactory conclusion
