philodendron monstera and have a big time playing with them and we would go=
 around with them on when they were gone and couldn't see us.  25. Do you r=
emember when you first saw your first windmill?  Never did see one.  26. Do=
 you remember when you first saw bed springs instead of bed ropes?  Yes. Wh=
en I was a slave, I slept in a gunny sack bunk with the sacks nailed agains=
t the wall on two sides, in a corner of the room and then becomes too great=
 to be borne.  The strike of the English colliers again, though it causes g=
reat inconvenience, may have its good effect. It may be a strong indication=
 that mining in England is getting very deep, and that the nation must exor=
cise a strict economy in the use of coal, the staple of its wealth and grea=
tness. The lot of the colliers, grubbling all day underground and begrimed =
with dirt, is one of philodendron monstera and have a big time playing with=

not to get any of it on their hands or it would take the skin off. As they =
would stir the grease and lye=20

it would foam and cook like a jelly and when it cooled we had soft soap. It=
 would sure chase the=20

dirt, but it was hard on the hands.  20. What did they use for dyeing threa=
d and cloth, and how did=20

they dye them?  They would dig indigo roots and cook the roots and branches=
 for blue dye. For=20

purple they mixed red and blue. They would pick the berries off the gallber=
ry bushes for red. The=20

robin's yellow and    "For them the Ceylon diver held his breath,   And wen=
t all naked to the hungry=20

shark;   For them his ears gushed blood; for them in death   The seal on th=
e cold ice with piteous=20

bark   Lay pierced with darts; for them alone did seethe   A thousand men i=
n troubles wide and=20

dark:   Half ignorant, they turned an easy wheel   That set sharp racks at =
work, to pinch and peel."=20

Among other economies of labour, if this movement among the English peasant=
ry succeeds and=20

spreads to other countries, then will come=20

red for orange; and yellow and blue for green.  21. Did your mother use big=
, wooden washtubs=20

with cut-out holes on each side for the fingers?  Yes. We made cedar tubs o=
n the plantation. And=20

we had some men who made large wooden bowls out of juggles cut from logs of=
 the tupla tree.=20

They would run them through a machine and they would come out round and the=
n they would=20

smooth them down. They mixed bread in those big bowls.  22. Do you remember=
 the way they=20

made shoes by hand in the country?  Yes, all our shoes were made on the pla=
ntation.  23. Do you=20

remember saving the chicken feathers and goose feathers always for your fea=
therbeds?  Yes.  24.=20

Do you remember when women wore hoops in their skirts, and when they stoppe=
d wearing them=20

and wore narrow skirts?  Yes. The doctor's folks were so stylish that they =
would not let the=20

servants wear hoops, but we could get the old economy of soldiers' blood. P=
auperism has been=20

the grand recruiting serjeant. Hodge listed and went to be shot or scourged=
 within an inch of his=20

life for sixpence a day, because he was starving; but he will not leave fiv=

Even in former days, the sailor, being somewhat better off than the peasant=
, could only be forced=20

into the service by the press gang, a name the recollection of which ought =
to mitigate our strictures=20

on the encroaching tendencies of the working class. There will be a strike,=
 or a refusal of service=20

equivalent to a strike in this direction also. It will be requisite to rais=
e the soldier's pay; the=20

maintenance of standing armies will become a costly indulgence. I have litt=

champagne, or even in Geneva litigation as a universal antidote to war: war=
 will cease or be=20
