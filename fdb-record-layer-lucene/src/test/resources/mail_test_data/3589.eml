ardanus tells _
the dishonest clerk had been served in patience and unrepining penitence. H=
e had won the good=20

opinion of warders, governor, and chaplain. He was granted such indulgences=
 as were consistent=20

with the discipline of his prison. He was not unlikely to get a ticket of l=
eave as soon as one could=20

be granted.  One evening, amid the calm thoughts which solitude engendered,=
 there came a=20

notion that he ought not to have allowed that error of Mr. Crapp's about hi=
s own autograph to have=20

gone uncorrected. It was, he had always understood, desirable to tell the t=
ruth--if for no special or=20

other reason, for the abstract interests of truth. And, for his own sake, w=
as it not desirable to let=20

the real facts be known? Why should he suffer under the odium of a deeper c=
riminality than he=20

had been guilty of? He determined to speak to the chaplain on the subject. =
He did so. The=20

chaplain thought he was right in desiring to make these explanations. The r=
everend gentleman, in=20

his simplicity, said he would write to Mr. Crapp and so endeavour to lighte=
n the burden of that=20

gentleman's prejudice, and perhaps from the earth; but there is one case on=
 record of two priests=20

being killed by lightning from a cloud only thirty yards from the ground; w=
hile another thunder=20

storm is noted as having occurred eighteen thousand feet from the earth. As=
 sound travels about=20

one thousand and ninety feet per second, any one may ascertain the distance=
 of a flash by noting=20

the time that elapses ere the thunder is heard. All existing records fail t=
o tell of thunder heard more=20

than four miles; while the cannonading at Paris in 1871 could be heard one =
hundred and five=20

miles; and Waterloo could be heard one hundred and fifty miles.  The action=
 of lightning is=20

instantaneous, and when near by the report is at first a single sharp crack=
; but it is always followed=20

by a long rolling, so characteristic that every name given the thunder in a=
 measure endeavors to=20

imitate it. The reason of the continued roll from a single flash is simple,=
 and is to be found in the=20

fact that a flash usually travels several miles; and as sound travels as st=
ated above, the sounds=20

generated at different distances come to the ear in=20

his late clerk's behalf. The chaplain, in an accidental bit of wisdom, ment=
ioned the story of the=20

convict to the governor. The governor saw at once, or suspected there had b=
een, an object in Mr.=20

Crapp's evidence, although he hardly knew what it was. His brother-in-law, =
who was a solicitor,=20

was then on a visit at his house for a couple of days. The whole story was =
repeated succession,=20

resulting in a continuous roar.  As the flash is due merely to the attracti=
on between two bodies=20

charged with opposite kinds of electricity, the discharge may pass either u=
p or down. Cases are on=20
