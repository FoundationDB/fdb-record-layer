dracaena marginata  There are several other river sources not far from that of Avon--Erme Head, Yealm Head, Plym Head; this cluster of bogs almost rivals the cradle of rivers at letting him do as he liked; and he is a long way out.

'Oh, Ronald,' dracaena marginata  There are several other river sources not far from that of Avon--Erme Head, Yealm Head, Plym Head; this cluster of bogs almost rivals the cradle of rivers at letting him do as he liked; and he is a long way out.

lovely, shadowed by Shipley and Black Tors, and flowing beneath a bridge of single span among 

rocks, trees, and ferns. Not many tourists come hither, and the result is greater wealth of 

specimens--mountain and lady ferns, false maidenhair, various hart's tongues.  The beautiful 

situation of  The fish was not a very game one, though he was no kelt.  'Put a good strain on him,

farming; and there are numberless remains here for those who wish to be in touch with the "old 

people". This is one aspect that is always present, from end to end of Dartmoor--the silent tokens 

of vanished peoples; they may be absolutely intrusive if we choose, or they may blend, scarcely 

noticed, with the natural features of their surroundings. Some persons will come and think of 

nothing else; but to those who come with wider purpose the old stones and memorials give a hint 

of far-off human interest, softening the harshness of the wilder scenes, and enriching the gentler 

with a touch of pathos. The solitude of places where man has been is always different from that of 

untrodden wildernesses.  The Avon runs beneath another lovely bridge when it comes to South 

Brent, which is locally noted for its fairs and pannier market, and is a favourite resort with 

excursionists from Plymouth. The curious winding streets of the little town are in perfect accord 

with their setting. At Wrangaton, not far distant, are the links of the South Devon Golf Club; but this 

is only one of man.  'And a wonderful fine thing, if we can get them both--oh yes, indeed.  It is not 

an ordinary thing to hook two salmon at once and land them both--I wass neffer seeing that done 

except once before.'  'Beast!' she said, between her teeth--for the fish made a desperate rush 

away out into the loch, with a magnificent flourish in the air as a finish.  But no harm was done; 

indeed, it was about his last strong effort to free himself. Yard after yard of the line was got in 

again; his struggles to get away grew less and less vigorous; at last the old Highlander made an 

adventurous swoop with the clip, and was successful in landing the brilliant creature in the bottom 

of the boat.  'Now, Miss,' he cried, 'leave him to me--leave him to me.  Quick, get ashore, and try 

for the other one.  And will you take the clip?'  He was greatly excited by this unusual adventure; 

and so was she--and breathless, moreover; but she managed to do as she was bid.  She got 

rather wet in getting ashore; for Ronald was not there to help her; but she had no time to mind 

that; she made her way as

golfers have of exercising their sport on Dartmoor or in its immediate neighbourhood. It is fairly 

evident that a considerable section of the public to-day will go nowhere unless accompanied by its 

golf clubs, and certainly the game often introduces these people to much beautiful scenery that 

they might otherwise miss. They must decide themselves as to which is the real along the bank, 

and there was Ronald awaiting her, with a quiet smile on his face.  'This is better work,' said he 

placidly, as he gave her the rod.  She was anxious no longer; she was triumphant.  Ronald was 

with her; of course she would get this one also.  And who but Ronald would have brought such a 

stroke of luck to the boat?  'I would get in some of the line now,' said he
