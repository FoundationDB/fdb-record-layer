the absence of the _Book of Numbers_,(353) the Kabalists of the West are only entitled to come to 

definite conclusions, when they have at hand some data at least from that "ancient document"--

data now found scattered throughout Egyptian papyri, Assyrian tiles, and the traditions preserved 

by the descendants of the disciples of the last Nazars. Instead of that, most of them accept as 

their authorities and infallible guides Sabre d'Olivet--who was a man of immense erudition and of 

speculative mind, but neither a Kabalist nor an Occultist, either Western or Eastern--and the 

Mason Ragon, the greatest of the "Widow's sons," who was even less of an Orientalist than 

d'Olivet, for Sanskrit learning was almost unknown in the days of both these eminent scholars. 

SECTION XXI. HEBREW ALLEGORIES.   How can any Kabalist, acquainted with the foregoing, 

deduce his conclusions with regard to the true Esoteric beliefs of the primitive Jews, from that only 

which he now finds in the Jewish scrolls? How can any scholar--even though one of the keys to 

the universal language be now positively discovered, the true key public knows. I never meddle in 

intrigues, and if I occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others I am sure your 

eminence will approve of my keeping them secret."  Mazarin shook his head.  "Ah!" he said; "some 

ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know."  "My lord," replied Guitant, "such 

ministers do not weigh men in the same balance; they get their information on war from warriors; 

on intrigues, from intriguers. Consult some politician of the period of which you speak, and if you 

pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want."  "Eh, pardieu!" said Mazarin, with a 

grimace which he always made when spoken to about money. "They will be paid, if there is no 

way of getting out of it."  "Does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in 

the cabals of that day?"  "By Bacchus!" rejoined Mazarin, impatiently, "it's about an hour since I 

asked you for that very thing, wooden-head that you are."  "There is one man for whom I can 

answer, if he will speak out."  "That's my concern; I will make him speak."  "Ah, my lord, 'tis not 

easy to make

geometrical system--give out anything as his _final_ conclusion? Modern Kabalistic speculation is 

on a par now with modern "speculative Masonry;" for as the latter tries vainly to link itself with the 

ancient--or rather the archaic--Masonry of the Temples, failing to make the link because all its 

claims have been shown to be inaccurate let out."  "Pooh! with patience one must succeed. Well, 

this man. Who is he?"  "The Comte de Rochefort."  "The Comte de Rochefort!"  "Unfortunately he 

has disappeared these four or five years and I don't know where he is."  "I know, Guitant," said 

Mazarin.  "Well, then, how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of
