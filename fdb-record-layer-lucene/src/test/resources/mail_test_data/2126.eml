appeared on earth during the Satya Yuga. If all of these have been so far closely united in the 

visions of the seers of every age--the bible seers included--there must have been a reason for it. 

Nor need one go back so far as into the periods of "superstition" and "unscientific fancies" to find 

great men in our epoch sharing in them. It is well known that Kepler, the eminent astronomer, in 

common with many other great men who believed that the heavenly bodies ruled favourably or 

adversely the fates of men and nations--fully credited besides this the fact that all heavenly bodies, 

even our own earth, are endowed with living and thinking souls.  Le Couturier's opinion is worthy 

of notice in this relation:       We are too inclined to criticize man has not even the honor of a tomb 

at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away. Remember, Raoul, this! If Richelieu 

made the king, by comparison, seem small, he made royalty great. The Palace of the Louvre 

contains two things--the king, who must die, and royalty, which never dies. The minister, so 

feared, so hated by his master, has descended into the tomb, drawing after him the king, whom he 

would not leave alone on earth, lest his work should be destroyed. So blind were his 

contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal's death as a deliverance; and I, even I, opposed 

the designs of the great man who held the destinies of France within the hollow of his hand. Raoul,

astrology and its ideas; nevertheless our criticism, to be one,     ought at least to know, lest it 

should be proved aimless, what     those ideas in truth are. And when among the men we thus 

criticize, we find such names as those of Regiomontanus, Tycho     Brahe, Kepler, etc., there is 

reason why we should be careful.     Kepler was an astrologer by profession, and is the gift of God. 

Whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve, abandon the exterior, the material 

appearance for the invisible principle, for the invisible principle is everything. Raoul, I seem to read 

your future destiny as through a cloud. It will be happier, I think, than ours has been. Different in 

your fate from us, you will have a king without a minister,
