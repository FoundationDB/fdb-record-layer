In an interview, published immediately after Ibsen's death, Bjrnstjerne Bjr=
nson, questioned as to=20

what he held to be his brother-poet's greatest work, replied, without a mom=
ent's hesitation,=20

_Gengangere_. This dictum can scarcely, I think, be accepted without some q=
ualification. Even=20

confining our attention to the modern plays, and leaving out of comparison =
_The Pretenders_,=20

_Brand_, and _Peer Gynt_, we can scarcely call _Ghosts_ Ibsen's richest or =
most human play,=20

and certainly not his profoundest or most poetical. If some omnipotent Cens=
orship decreed the=20

annihilation of all his works save one, few people, I imagine, would vote t=
hat that one should be=20

_Ghosts_. Even if half a dozen works were to be saved from the wreck, I dou=
bt whether I, for my=20

part, would include _Ghosts_ in the list. It is, in my judgment, a little b=
are, hard, austere. It is the=20

first work in which Ibsen applies his new technical method--evolved, as I h=
ave suggested, during=20

the composition of _A Doll's House_--and he applies it with something of fa=
naticism. He is under=20

the sway of a prosaic and fifty pounds, fired when we were close together, =
which struck the turret=20

so squarely that it received the whole force. Here you see the scar, two an=
d a half inches deep in=20

the wrought iron, a perfect mould of the shell. If anything could test the =
turret, it was that shot. It=20

did not start a rivet-head or a nut! It stunned the two men who were neares=
t where the ball struck,=20

and that was all. I touched the lever--the turret revolved as smoothly as b=
efore. The turret had=20

stood the test; I could mark that point of weakness off my list forever.  =
=E2=80=9CYou notice that the deck is=20

joined to the side of the hull by a right angle, at what sailors call the =
=E2=80=98plank-shear.=E2=80=99 If a projectile=20

struck that angle, what would happen? It would not be deflected; its whole =
force would be=20

expended there. It might open a seam in the hull below the water-line, or p=
ierce the wooden hull,=20

and sink us. Here was our second point of weakness.  =E2=80=9CI had decided=
 how I would fight her in=20

advance. I would keep the _Monitor_ moving in a circle, just large enough t=

the guns. At the=20

phrase, "My object was to make the reader feel that he was going through a =
piece of real=20

experience"--and he is putting some constraint upon the poet within him. Th=
e action moves a little=20

stiffly, and all in one rhythm. It lacks variety and suppleness. Moreover, =
the _Merrimac_ our guns=20

should be fired, and loaded while we were moving around the circuit. Eviden=
tly the _Merrimac_=20

would return the compliment every time. At our second exchange of shots, sh=
