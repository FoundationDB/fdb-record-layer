a snarl in the distance alarmed them.  =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s Puma and his m=
ate creeping up from this direction,=E2=80=9D _
mispronounced them so that they meant something absurd or blasphemous. When=
 asked which=20

they preferred, Islam or idolatry, they frankly avowed that they preferred =
idolatry. To lie about their=20

own religion and to ridicule another religion that was doing a great and go=
od work around them=20

was not enough for these Jews; they must set their poets to work to lampoon=
 the women of the=20

believers in obscene verse, and such outrages upon common decency, not to s=
ay upon the code=20

of Arab honour and chivalry, became a favourite occupation among the poets =
of the Jewish clans.=20

These were offences against the religion and the persons of the Muslims. Th=
ey also conspired=20

against the state. Mohammad was not only the preacher of Islam, he was also=
 the king of Medina,=20

and was responsible for the safety and peace of the city. As a prophet, he =
could afford to ignore=20

the jibes of the Jews, though they maddened him to fury; but as the chief o=
f the city, the general in=20

a time of almost continual warfare, when Medina was kept in a state of mili=
tary defence and under=20

a sort of military discipline, he could not overlook treachery. He was boun=
d by his duty to his=20

subjects to suppress a party that might (and nearly did) lead to the sack o=
f the city by investing=20

armies. The measures he took for this object have furnished his European bi=
ographers with a=20

handle for attack. It is, I believe, solely on the ground of his treatment =
of the Jews that Mohammad=20

has been called 'a bloodthirsty tyrant:' it would certainly be difficult to=
 support the epithet on other=20

grounds.  The bloodthirstiness consists in this: some half-dozen Jews, who =
had distinguished=20

themselves by their virulence against the Muslims, or by their custom of ca=
rrying information to the=20

common enemy of Medina, were executed; two of the three Jewish clans were s=
ent into exile, just=20

as they had previously come into exile, and the third was exterminated--the=
 men killed, and the=20

women and children made slaves. The execution of the half-dozen marked Jews=
 is generally=20

called assassination, because a Muslim was sent secretly to kill each of th=
e criminals. The reason=20

is almost too obvious to need explanation. There were no police or law-cour=
ts or even courts-

martial at Medina; some one of the followers of Mohammad must therefore be =
the executor of the=20

sentence of death, and it was better it should be done quietly, as the exec=
uting of a man openly=20

before his clan would have caused a brawl and more bloodshed and retaliatio=
n, till the whole city=20

had become mixed up in the quarrel. If secret assassination is the word for=
 such deeds, secret=20

assassination was a necessary part of the internal government of Medina. Th=
e men must be killed,=20

and best in that way. In saying this I assume that Mohammad was cognisant o=
f the deed, and that=20

it was not merely a case and ears open on the left.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt=
=E2=80=99s my opinion,=E2=80=9D said Young Black Buck=20

slowly, =E2=80=9Cthat Puma=E2=80=99s greatly over-rated. Why, he hasn=E2=80=
=99t killed one of the herd as long as any one=20

can remember.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo, but that=E2=80=99s because Father Buck=
 has been such a wise leader.=E2=80=9D  Young Black=20

Buck sniffed in scorn. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t know that he=E2=80=99s been=
 any better or wiser than other leaders,=E2=80=9D was the=20

retort. =E2=80=9CIf my father had been leader Puma or Timber Wolf wouldn=E2=
=80=99t have caught a deer. They=20

wouldn=E2=80=99t have dared. They=E2=80=99re all afraid of him.=E2=80=9D  W=
hite Tail felt that this boasting wouldn=E2=80=99t get them=20

anywhere, and would in the end lead to unpleasant words; but he knew that i=
f Puma or Timber=20

Wolf heard it they would laugh in glee.  =E2=80=9CIf you=E2=80=99re rested =
suppose we go back,=E2=80=9D White Tail said.=20

=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re going to make quicker time back. I=E2=80=99m going t=
o run my best.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd I too. I=E2=80=99m going to beat=20

you. I=E2=80=99m sorry you got tired out, and had to rest. Well, I=E2=80=99=
m ready.=E2=80=9D  White Tail could afford a smile at=20

this remark, for Young Black Buck had made the request to stop for a short =
time. Tired out! Why,=20

he felt as fresh and strong as when they started. He would punish Young Bla=
ck Buck by making=20

his defeat as unpleasant as he could.  But before either one could start fo=
r the return trip there was=20



a noise among the leaves of the spruce tree under which they were standing,=
 and with visions of=20

Puma crouching among the branches ready to drop down upon them their hearts=
 gave a great=20

bound and almost stood still. In another moment they would have been off li=
ke a shot, but there=20

was a flutter of wings, and Downy the Woodpecker, who had made the noise wi=
th his beak, spoke.=20

=E2=80=9CHist! Listen!=E2=80=9D he called. =E2=80=9CListen, White Tail=E2=
=80=94and you too, Young Black Buck!=E2=80=9D  Both of the runners=20

stopped and looked up among the branches of the trees where Downy was sitti=
ng.  =E2=80=9CPuma is on=20

your trail,=E2=80=9D Downy added. =E2=80=9CHe caught your wind way back the=
re, and he=E2=80=99s been trailing you ever=20

since. I saw him, and hurried to tell you.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThank you, Do=
wny,=E2=80=9D replied White Tail. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s time we=20

were off. He can never catch us if he=E2=80=99s behind.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9C=
I didn=E2=80=99t say he was behind you,=E2=80=9D replied Downy.=20

=E2=80=9CHe was on your trail, but Puma=E2=80=99s too wise to follow you th=
at way. You don=E2=80=99t know him. When he=20

picked up your trail, he followed you by the wind. While you were running a=
round in a circle, he=E2=80=99s=20

been cutting across it. He=E2=80=99s between you and the herd.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CIn that case,=E2=80=9D said Young Black Buck in a=20

frightened voice, =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99ll take a wide circuit, and he=E2=80=
=99ll miss us.=E2=80=9D  Again Downy shook his head. =E2=80=9CYou=20

are young,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cand don=E2=80=99t know how Puma hunts=
. He hunts with his mate, and she=E2=80=99ll be off to=20

the right to head you off.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen what can we do?=E2=80=9D=
 asked Young Black Buck, his legs shaking and=20

his voice trembling.  =E2=80=9CI really don=E2=80=99t know what to say. I c=
ame here to tell you of your danger. I can=E2=80=99t=20

tell you what to=20


_
instances the evidence that traces these executions to Mohammad's order is =
either entirely=20

wanting or is too doubtful to claim our credence.  Of the sentences upon th=
e three whole clans,=20

that of exile, passed upon two of them, was clement enough. They were a tur=
bulent set, always=20

setting the people of Medina by the ears; and finally a brawl followed by a=
n insurrection resulted in=20

the expulsion of one tribe; and insubordination, alliance with enemies, and=
 a suspicion of=20

conspiracy against the Prophet's life, ended similarly for the second. Both=
 tribes had violated the=20

original treaty, and had endeavoured in every way to bring Mohammad and his=
 religion to ridicule=20

and destruction. The only question is whether their punishment was not too =
light. Of the third clan=20

a fearful example was made, not by Mohammad, but by an arbiter appointed by=
 themselves.=20

When the Kureysh and their allies were besieging Medina, and had well-nigh =
stormed the=20

defences, this Jewish tribe entered into negotiations with the enemy, which=
 were only=20

circumvented by the diplomacy of the Prophet. When the besiegers had retire=
d, Mohammad=20

naturally demanded an explanation of the Jews. They resisted in their dogge=
d way, and were=20

themselves besieged and compelled to surrender at discretion. Mohammad, how=
ever, consented=20

to the appointing of a chief of a tribe allied to the Jews as the judge who=
 should pronounce=20

sentence upon them. The man in question was a fierce soldier, who had been =
wounded in the=20

attack on the Jews, and indeed died from his wound the same day. This chief=
 gave sentence that=20

the men, in number some six hundred, should be killed, and the women and ch=
ildren enslaved;=20

and the  =E2=80=9CCouldn=E2=80=99t we go back a little on our track, and th=
en get around Puma and his mate?=E2=80=9D=20

asked White Tail, struggling hard to keep cool.  =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m afrai=
d if you do that you=E2=80=99ll run into Timber Wolf=20

and his family. Puma gave him the alarm, and he=E2=80=99s out with his whol=
e pack to cut you off in that=20

direction.=E2=80=9D  By this time Young Black Buck was so excited and frigh=
tened that he hardly knew what=20

to do. To be cornered by Puma and Timber Wolf, with all the yelping pack, w=
as a terrible thing,=20

and there seemed no way of escape. A sudden rustling in the bushes made him=
 jump nearly five=20

feet away. Even White Tail leaped to one side.  But it wasn=E2=80=99t Puma =
or Timber Wolf. It was Washer=20

the Raccoon, and what Washer had to propose will appear in the next story. =
Washer was=20

considered a very wise, shrewd animal, and perhaps he had a way for them to=
 escape.=20

STORY VII                       A RACE WITH PUMA AND TIMBER   Washer the Ra=
ccoon poked his=20

nose out of the bushes, and looked blinkingly at White Tail and Young Black=
 Buck, while Downy=20

the Woodpecker gazed down at all three with an expression in his eyes that =
plainly said: =E2=80=9CWell, I=E2=80=99m=20

glad I=E2=80=99ve got wings, and can fly away if I want to.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CGoodness!=E2=80=9D grunted White Tail. =E2=80=9CYou frightened=20

the life out of us, Washer! We thought you were Puma or Timber creeping upo=
n us.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, I=E2=80=99ve=20

been mistaken for Groundy and Billy Mink, but never for Puma or Timber befo=
re,=E2=80=9D replied Washer.=20

=E2=80=9CIt must be that you=E2=80=99re excited or have a bad conscience. I=
 wonder which it is.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot the latter, I=20

hope,=E2=80=9D answered White Tail. =E2=80=9CBut as for being excited, I th=
ink we have good reason for that. Downy=20

just brought us word that=20


_
harsh, bloody sentence, worthy of the episcopal generals of the army agains=
t the Albigenses, or of=20

the deeds of the Augustan age of Puritanism; but it must be remembered that=
 the crime of these=20

men was high treason against the State, during time of siege; and those who=
 have read how=20

Wellington's march could be traced by the bodies of deserters and pillagers=
 hanging from the=20

trees, need not be surprized at the summary execution of a traitorous clan.=
  Whilst Mohammad's=20

supremacy was being established and maintained among the mixed population o=
f Mekka, a=20

vigorous warfare was being carried on outside have us surrounded.=E2=80=9D =
 Washer sat up on his hind=20

legs, and leaned against a tree. His shrewd, golden eyes flashed brightly i=
n the sunshine, and his=20

double row of white teeth glistened every time he opened his mouth.  =E2=80=
=9CIf that=E2=80=99s the case,=E2=80=9D he said,=20

=E2=80=9CI think it=E2=80=99s about time I took to my hole. I have no love =
or respect for Puma and Timber.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNeither=20

have we,=E2=80=9D said Young Black Buck, =E2=80=9Cbut we have no hole to ru=
n in. What are we going to do?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf=20

you only had wings I could answer that question,=E2=80=9D interrupted Downy=
. =E2=80=9CI know what I=E2=80=99d do.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd if=20

you had a hole you could crawl in, I could advise you,=E2=80=9D added=20


_
war, consisting as it did mainly of small raids and attacks upon caravans, =
I need not dwell; its=20

leading features were the two battles of Bedr and Ohud, in the first of whi=
ch three hundred=20

Muslims, though outnumbered at the odds of three to one, were completely vi=
ctorious (A.D. 624,=20

A.H. 2); whilst at Ohud, being outnumbered in the like proportion and deser=
ted by the 'Disaffected'=20

party, they were almost as decisively defeated (A.H. 3). Two years later th=
e Kureysh, gathering=20

together their allies, advanced upon Medina and besieged it for fifteen day=
s; but the foresight of=20

Mohammad in digging a trench, and the enthusiasm of the Muslims in defendin=
g it, resisted all=20

assaults, and the coming of the heavy storms for which the climate of Medin=
a is noted drove the=20

enemy back to Mekka. The next year (A.H. 6) a ten years' truce was conclude=
d with the Kureysh,=20

in pursuance of which a strange Washer.  Of course, this brought no relief =
to either White Tail=E2=80=99s or=20

Young Black Buck=E2=80=99s harassed minds. They weren=E2=80=99t interested =
in what Downy or Washer would do.=20

They wanted to know what they could do to escape the terrible trap.  Sudden=
ly to make their=20

situation more desperate, a distant howl rent the air. It was Timber Wolf c=
alling to the pack. Almost=20

instantly there was an answering cry on the left, then another in front, an=
d a third on the right.  =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s=20

the pack=E2=80=99s hunting cry,=E2=80=9D exclaimed Washer. =E2=80=9CThey=E2=
=80=99re calling to each other as they close in. Yes,=20

they=E2=80=99ve picked up your scent, White Tail.=E2=80=9D  Young Black Buc=

leaped around in a circle, uttering plaintive little whimpers. =E2=80=9CI=
