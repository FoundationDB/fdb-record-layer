There he was, conducting his philodendron monstera that the hook was torn from the mouth of Old Muskie, and again Lee reeled in his line without the big fish at the end of it.  Both boys sat in the canoe for several minutes as blue as boys could be. It certainly was was implacably set against Parfitts, because he was convinced that Mr. Oxford had sought to take advantage of his blindness. There he was, conducting his action regardless of his blindness. There he was, conducting his _
splicing and of braiding many strands. He unbraided the silk line for a considerable length, and 

weaving in one by one the copper wire lengths that he had cut from the spool, he joined the wire to 

the silk with a joint that would readily pass through a line-guide, and continued to braid till he had a 

six-foot, flexible copper leader that would sustain his own weight, united to his one hundred yards 

of line with a joint as strong as the line itself. Thus did he provide against the teeth of Old Muskie. 

Tuesday morning the boys were again fishing in Forest Lodge Cove at daybreak. Again Old 

Muskie struck, and unable to cut the line, rushed into the interlacing boughs of the submerged 

treetops.  For a while the strain on the rod indicated that he was surging back and forth among the 

treetops, but soon the dead pull showed that the old warrior was no longer making a fight.  Rowing 

in, the boys found the casting-bait fast on one of the limbs. When they got it loose and pulled it in, 

they found that one of the treble hooks was gone. Old Muskie in his rush had caught one of the 

hooks upon a branch and it had held, while the one that was in his mouth had pulled from the 

minnow, and the big savage of the lake was again at liberty.  Lee made a change in his minnow 

before the next mind the luggage being lost, I don't."  During this she was collecting the crockery 

on a tray, with which tray she whizzed out of the room.  In ten minutes, hatted, heavily veiled, and 

gloved, she cautiously opened the front door and peeped forth into the lamplit street She peered to 

right and to left. Then she went as far as the gate and peered again.  "Is it all right?" whispered 

Priam, who was behind her.  "Yes, I think so," she whispered.  Priam came out of the house with 

the bag in one hand and the valise in the other, a pipe in his mouth, a stick under his arm, and an 

overcoat on his shoulder. Alice ran up the steps, gazed within the house, pulled the door to 

silently, and locked it. Then beneath the summer stars she and Priam hastened furtively, as 

though the luggage had contained swag, up Werter Road towards Oxford Road. When they had 

turned the corner they felt very much relieved.  They had escaped.  It was their second attempt. 

The first, made in daylight, had completely failed. Their cab had been followed to Paddington 

Station by three other cabs containing the representatives and the cameras of three Sunday 

newspapers. A journalist had deliberately accompanied Priam to the booking office, had heard him 

ask for two seconds to Weymouth, and had bought a second to

Instead of using the treble hooks that were fastened with screws into the sides of the minnow, he 

bored a hole in the body of the wooden bait, and using again his copper wire, passed it back and 

forth through the body of the minnow and through the eye of the treble hook on each side. He 

knew that no fish would break all these strands of copper wire, although he felt that Old Muskie 

might break the hooks.  The next Tuesday morning Lee again hooked Old Muskie. Again the big 

fish got to the treetops, and again Lee felt the dead pull that meant that he had no longer a fighting 

fish to deal with. Reeling up as Carl paddled the boat toward shore, Lee found that Old Muskie 

had entangled the line among the branches, and getting a chance to use his great strength, had 

broken the heavy silk line. Lee was delighted to see that it had been within two hours of their 

arrival Weymouth had become even more impossible than Werter Road, they had ignominiously 

but wisely come back.  Werter Road had developed into the most celebrated thoroughfare in 

London. Its photograph had appeared in scores of newspapers, with a cross marking the abode of 

Priam and Alice. It was beset and infested by journalists of several nationalities from morn till 

night. Cameras were as common in it as lamp-posts. And a famous descriptive reporter of the 

_Sunday News_ had got lodgings, at a high figure, exactly opposite No. 29. Priam and Alice could 

do nothing without publicity. And if it would be an exaggeration to assert, that evening papers 

appeared with Stop-press News: "5.40. Mrs. Leek went out shopping," the exaggeration would not 

be very extravagant. For a fortnight Priam had not been beyond

had spliced it to the copper leader.  "What can you do about that?" asked Carl.  "I'm not sure," said 

Lee, "but every time thus far the old fellow has run straight away from the direction in which I was 

reeling my minnow. I believe that if we come at him from near the shore he will take a run toward 

the open lake, and we'll have a chance at him."  During the week that followed, Lee again spliced 

a copper leader to his line. Again he "made over" a big casting-minnow, and when Tuesday 

morning brought its opportunity, Carl put the canoe along the shore, but as far out as the cheeks 

and tightened nerves, had devised the plan of flight before the early summer dawn.  They reached 

East Putney Station, of which the gates were closed, the first workman's train being not yet due. 

And there they stood. Not another human being was abroad. Only the clock of St. Bude's was 

faithfully awakening every soul within a radius of two hundred yards each quarter of an hour. Then 

a porter came and opened the gate--it was still exceedingly early--and Priam booked for Waterloo 

in triumph.  "Oh," cried Alice, as they mounted the stairs, "I quite forgot to draw up 


_
Three casts were made, each farther and farther forward, without results. The fourth, however, a 

perfect cast of over one hundred feet, which fell just beyond the farthest treetop, was rewarded; 

the water broke in a great eddy as Old Muskie took the bait. Lee struck with all his might, and 

pulled with all the force he dared to use, although he was pulling almost straight back toward the 

treetops.  As he had hoped, Old Muskie pulled the other way, and with a  "What did you want to 

draw up the blinds for?"  "If they're down everybody will know instantly that we've gone. Whereas if 

I--"  She began to descend the stairs.  "Alice!" he said sharply, in a strange voice. The muscles of 

his white face were drawn.  "What?"  "D--n the blinds. Come along, or upon my soul I'll kill you." 

She realized that his nerves were in active insurrection, and that a mere nothing might bring about 

the fall of the government.  "Oh,

tremendous rush, left the treetops, and started toward the channel into the open lake. Half-way 

across he gave an astonishing leap into the air, showing the boys for the first time just what a 

monster they had succeeded in hooking.  Hope more lively than any they had felt before filled the 

hearts of the young fishermen, as the monster maskinonge rushed across the cove. But instead of 

hitting the narrow open channel into the main lake, he rushed across the wide bar, through a 

veritable forest of bulrushes.  Then the fight was quickly over. The fish had been hooked only on 

the treble hook in the rear of the casting-minnow; the hooks on the side dragged through  In a 

quarter of an hour they were safely lost in the wilderness of Waterloo, and the newspaper train 

bore them off to Bournemouth for a few days' respite.   _The Nation's Curiosity_   The interest of 

the United Kingdom in the unique case of Witt _v_. Parfitts had already reached apparently the 

highest possible degree of intensity. And there was reason for the kingdom's passionate curiosity. 

Whitney Witt, the plaintiff, had come over to England, with his eccentricities, his retinue, his 

extreme wealth and his failing eyesight, specially to fight Parfitts. A half-pathetic figure, this white-

haired man, once a connoisseur, who, from mere habit, continued to
