Unto the king who rules our state;     And in this summons there is shown       A doubt begotten of 

my wretched fate.                      8  [_Reflectively. Aside._]      Ah! Were there those, the man to 

recognize       Who met me on the road, from bondage freed?     Or did the king, who sees through 

cunning spies,       Learn that my cart was lent him in his need?     Why should I else be forced to 

tread the street,     Like one accused of crime, my judge to meet?                 9  But why consider 

thus? I must go to the court-room. My good beadle, conduct me to the court.  _Beadle._ Follow 

me, sir. [_They walk about._]  _Charudatta._ [_Apprehensively._] And what means this?      Hear 

how the gloomy raven hoarsely croaks;       The slaves of justice summon me again;     My left eye 

twitches; these repeated strokes       Of threatened evil frighten me and pain.                   10 

_Beadle._ Follow me, sir, gently and without haste.  _Charudatta._ [_Walks about and looks 

before him._]      Upon the withered tree, a crow       Turns to the sun;     His left eye falls on me. 

Ah, woe!       My doubt is done.                                          11  [_He looks in another direction._] But 

see! a snake!      His eye is fixed upon me; and his back     Flashes like antimony's lustrous black; 

His long tongue quivers; four white fangs appear;     His belly swells and coils. He slumbered here, 

This prince of serpents, till I crossed his path,     And now he darts upon me in his wrath. 

12  [143.21. S.  And more than this:      I slip, although the ground has felt no rain;     My left eye, 

and my left arm throb again;     Another bird is screaming overhead;     All bodes a cruel death, 

and hope is fled.                   13  Surely, the gods will grant that all may yet be well.  _Beadle._ 

Follow me, sir. Here is the court-room. Pray enter.  _Charudatta._ [_Enters and looks about._] 

How wonderfully splendid is the court-room. For it seems an ocean,      Whose waters are the 

king's advisers, deep     In thought; as waves and shells it seems to keep     The attorneys; and as 

sharks and crocodiles     It has its spies that stand in waiting files;     Its elephants and horses[83] 

represent     The cruel ocean-fish on murder bent;     As if with herons of the sea, it shines     With 

screaming pettifoggers' numerous lines;     While in the guise of serpents, scribes are creeping 

Upon its statecraft-trodden shore: the court     The likeness of an ocean still is keeping, stood face 

to face were Moliere and the wife whom he now met only on the stage.  Moliere's genius could 

achieve nothing higher than _Tartufe_ and the _Misanthrope_. His powers suffered no decline, but 

he did not again put them to such strenuous uses. In 1668 the brilliant fantasy of _Amphitryon_, 

freely derived from Plautus, was succeeded by an admirable comedy in prose, _Georges Dandin_, 

in which the folly of unequal marriage between the substantial farmer and the fine lady is mocked 

with bitter gaiety. Before the year closed Moliere, continuing to write in prose, returned to Plautus, 

and surpassed him in _L'Avare_. To be rich and miserly is in itself a form of fatuity; but Harpagon 

is not only miserly but amorous, as far as a ruling passion will admit one of subordinate influence. 

_Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme_ (1670), a lesson of good sense to those who suffer from the social 

ambition to rise above their proper rank, is wholly original; it mounts in the close from comedy to 

the extravagance of farce, and perhaps in the uproarious laughter of the play we may discover a 

touch of effort or even of spasm. The operatic _Psyche_ (1671) is memorable as having combined 

the talents of Moliere, Corneille, and Quinault, with the added musical gifts of Lulli.  In _Les 

Femmes Savantes_ (1672) Moliere returned to an early theme, with variations suited to the times. 

The Hotel de Rambouillet was closed; the new tribe of _precieuses_ had learnt the Cartesian 

philosophy, affected the sciences, were patronesses of physics, astronomy, anatomy. Something 

of the old romantic follies survived, and mingled strangely with the pretensions to science and the 



pedantries of erudition. Trissotin (doubtless a portrait in caricature from the Abbe Cotin) is the 

Tartufe of spurious culture; Vadius (a possible satire of Menage) is a pedant, arrogant and brutal. 

Shall the charming Henriette be sacrificed to gratify her mother's domineering temper and the 

base designs of an impostor? The forces are arrayed on either side; the varieties of learned and 

elegant folly in woman are finely distinguished; of the opposite party are Chrysale, the bourgeois 

father with his rude common-sense; the sage Ariste; the faithful servant, Martine, whose grammar 

may be faulty, but whose wit is sound and clear; and Henriette herself, the adorable, whom to 

know is more of a liberal education than to have explored all the Greek and Latin masters of 

Vadius and Trissotin. The final issue of the encounter between good sense, good nature, reason 

and folly,

To which all harmful-cruel beasts resort.                  14  Come! [_As he enters, he strikes his head 

against the door. Reflectively._] Alas! This also?      My left eye throbs; a raven cries;       A 

serpent coils athwart my path.     My safety now with heaven lies.              _Le Malade Imaginaire_ 

was written when Moliere was suffering from illness; but his energy remained indomitable. The 

comedy continued that long polemic against the medical faculty which he had sustained in 

_L'Amour Medecin_, _Monsieur de Pourceaugnac_, and other plays. Moliere had

But I must enter. [_He does so._]  P. 238.16]  _Judge._ This is Charudatta.      A countenance like 

his, with clear-cut nose,     Whose great, wide-opened eye frank candor shows,       Is not the 

home of wantonness;     With elephants, with horses, and with kine,     The outer form is inner 

habit's sign;       With men no less.                                          16  _Charudatta._ My greetings to 

the officers of justice. Officials, I salute you.  _Judge._ [_Betraying his agitation._] You are very 

welcome, sir. My good beadle, give the gentleman a seat.  _Beadle._ [_Brings a seat._] Here is a 

seat. Pray be seated, sir. [_Charudatta seats himself._]  _Sansthanaka._ [_Angrily._] You're here, 

are you, you woman-murderer? Well! Thish is a fine trial, thish is a jusht trial, where they give a 

sheat to thish woman-murderer. [_Haughtily._] But it's all right. They can give it to him.  _Judge._ 

Charudatta, have you any attachment, the physicians were the impostors of a learned hygiene. It 

was the dramatist's last jest at the profession. While playing the part of Argan on February 17, 

1673, the "Malade Imaginaire" fell dying on the stage; he forced a laugh, but could not continue his 

part; at ten o'clock he was no more. Through the exertions of his widow a religious funeral was 

permitted to an actor who had died unfortified by the rites of the Church.  Many admirable though 

slighter pieces served as the relief of his mind between the effort of his chief works. In all, gaiety 

and good sense interpenetrate each other. Kindly natured and generous, Moliere, a great 

observer, who looked through the deeds of men, was often taciturn--_le contemplateur_ of 

Boileau--and seemingly self-absorbed. Like many persons of artistic temperament, he loved 

splendour of life; but he was liberal in his largess to those who claimed his help. He brought 

comedy to nature, and made 


_
friendship, with this lady's daughter?  _Charudatta._ What lady?  _Judge._ This lady. [_He 

indicates Vasantasena's mother._]  _Charudatta._ [_Rising._] Madam, I salute you.  _Mother._ 

Long life to you, my son! [_Aside._] So this is Charudatta. My daughter's youth is in good hands. 

_Judge._ Sir, is the courtezan your friend? [_Charudatta betrays his embarrassment._]  of human 

life. His warfare was against all that is unreal and unnatural. He preached the worth of human 

happiness, good sense, moderation, humorous tolerance. He does not indulge in heroics, and yet 

there is heroism in his courageous outlook upon things. The disciple of Moliere cannot idealise the 

world into a scene of fairyland; he will conceive man as far from perfect,
