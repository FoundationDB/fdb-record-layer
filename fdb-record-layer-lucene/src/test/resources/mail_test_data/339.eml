philodendron monstera  Haggard rises, glaring at old Pepper in a menacing m=
anner. "Am I to regard your remark as any insinuation upon me, General Pepp=
er?" he said fiercely.  "I say it's a damned shame," repeated the veteran. =
 The hubbub became general. What was to be done? Of course, there would be =
a scandal, but in the eyes of most men at the Pandemonium Club, Haggard was=
 not to be blamed, he was merely to be envied. Probably the real fact was t=
hat the weak young fellow was suddenly carried off every 10th row to leave =
the last 10 stitches before the end unknitted.  This pattern is for an ordi=
nary figure, but after one trial the knitter will find it can be altered to=
 any size.     _Baby=E2=80=99s Jacket._   Pins No. 9, and fleecy or fingeri=
ng-wool.  Cast on 36, knit 5 plain rows.  Sixth row=E2=80=94knit 4, make 1,=
 knit the remainder. The next row plain.  Eighth row=E2=80=94knit 5, make 1=
, the rest plain. Continue in this way to make holes each time one stitch f=
urther from the edge until 13=20
