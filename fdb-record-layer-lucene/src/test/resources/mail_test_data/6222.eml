[_To Vasantasena. Aside._] Vasantasena,      'T is true, the night is dark,=
 O timid maid,     And like=20

the lightning hidden in the cloud,     You are not seen; yet you will be be=

garlands and by anklets loud.                    35  Have you heard me, Vas=
antasena?=20

_Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] Heard and understood. [_She removes the ankl=
e-rings, lays aside=20

the garlands, and takes a few steps, feeling her way._] I can feel the wall=
 of the house, and here is=20

a side-entrance. But alas! my fingers tell me that the door is shut.       =
  *       *       *       *       *=20

_Charudatta_ [_who is within the house_]. Comrade, my prayer is done. Go no=
w and offer=20

sacrifice to the Mothers.  _Maitreya._ No, I'm not going.  _Charudatta._ Al=
as!      The poor man's=20

kinsmen do not heed his will;     The friends who loved him once, now stand=
 afar;     His sorrows=20

multiply; his strength is nil;     Behold! his character's bright-shining s=
tar     Fades like the waning=20

moon; and deeds of ill     That others do, are counted to him still.       =
             36  And again:      No=20

man when they meet.=20

Where rich men hold a feast, if he draw near,     He meets with scornful lo=
oks for looks of cheer.=20

[15.19. S.      Where vulgar throngs are gathered, 't is the same;     His =
scanty raiment wakes his=20

 I find the sixth is--to be=20

poor.                       37  And yet again:      Ah, Poverty, I pity the=

as thy dearest friend;     When my poor life has met its woeful end,     I =
sadly and final triumph are=20

rendered in a monologue which expounds the action of the piece with admirab=
le spirit.  If the=20

Mystery served to fill the void left by the national epopee, the farce may =
be regarded as to some=20

extent the dramatic inheritor of the spirit of the fabliau. It aims at mirt=
h and laughter for their own=20

sakes, without any purpose of edification; it had, like the fabliau, the me=
rit of brevity, and not=20

infrequently the fault of unabashed grossness. But the very fact that it wa=
s a thing of little=20

consequence allowed the farce to exhibit at times an audacity of political =
or ecclesiastical criticism=20

which transformed it into a dramatised pamphlet. In general it chose its ma=
tter from the ludicrous=20

misadventures of private life: the priest, the monk, the husband, the mothe=
r-in-law, the wife, the=20

lover, the roguish servant are the agents in broadly ludicrous intrigues; t=
he young wife lords it over=20

her dotard husband, and makes mockery of his presumptive heirs, in _La Corn=
ette_ of Jean=20

d'Abondance; in _Le Cuvier_, the husband, whose many household duties have =
been scheduled,=20

has his revenge--the list, which he deliberately recites while his wife flo=
unders helpless in the great=20

washing-tub, does not include the task of effecting her deliverance.  Amid =
much that is trivial and=20

much that is indecent, one farce stands out pre-eminent, and may indeed be =
called a comedy of=20

manners and of character--the merry misfortunes of that learned advocate, _=
Maitre Pierre=20

Pathelin_. The date is doubtless about 1470; the author, probably a Parisia=
n and a member of the=20

Basoche, is unknown. With all his toiling and cheating, Pathelin is poor; w=
ith infinite art and spirit=20

he beguiles the draper of the cloth which will make himself a coat and his =
faithful Guillemette a=20

gown; when=20


_
_Maitreya._ [_Betraying his embarrassment._] Well, comrade, if I must go, a=
t least let Radanika go=20

with me, to keep me company.  _Charudatta._ Radanika, you are to accompany =
Maitreya.=20

_Radanika._ Yes, sir.  _Maitreya_. Mistress Radanika, do you take the offer=
ing and the candle=20

while I open the side-door. [_He does so._]  _Vasantasena._ It seems as if =
the door took pity on=20

me and opened of itself. I will lose no time, but enter. [_She looks in._] =
What? a candle? Oh dear,=20

oh dear! [_She puts it out with her skirt and enters._]  _Charudatta._ What=
 was that, Maitreya?=20

_Maitreya._ I opened the side-door and the wind came through all in a lump =
and blew out the=20

candle. Suppose you go out by the side-door, Radanika, and I will follow as=
 soon as I have gone=20

into the courtyard and lighted the candle again.                    [_Exit.=
_  _Sansthanaka._ Mashter!=20

mashter! I'm looking for Vasantasena.  _Courtier._ Keep on looking, keep on=
 looking!=20

_Sansthanaka._ [_Does so._] Mashter! mashter! I've caught her! I've caught =
her!  _Courtier._ Idiot,=20

you've caught me.  _Sansthanaka._ You shtand right here, mashter, and shtay=
 no time, comes for=20

his money and an added dinner of roast goose, behold Maitre Pathelin is in =
a raging fever, raving=20

in every dialect. Was the purchase of his cloth a dream, or work of the dev=
il? To add to the worthy=20

tradesman's ill-luck, his shepherd has stolen his wool and eaten his sheep.=
 The dying Pathelin=20

unexpectedly appears in court to defend the accused, and having previously =
advised his client to=20

affect idiocy and reply to all questions with the senseless utterance _bee_=
, he triumphantly wins=20

the case; but the tables are turned when Master Pathelin demands his fee, a=
nd can obtain no=20

other response than _bee_ from the instructed shepherd. The triumph of rogu=
e over rogue is the=20

only moral of the piece; it is a satire on fair dealing and justice, and, t=
hough the morals of a farce=20

are not to be gravely insisted on, such morals as _Maitre Pathelin_ present=
s agree well with the=20

spirit of the age which first enjoyed this masterpiece of caricature.  The =
actors in mediaeval=20

comedy, as in the serious drama, were amateurs. The members of the academic=
 _puys_ were=20

succeeded by the members of guilds, or=20
