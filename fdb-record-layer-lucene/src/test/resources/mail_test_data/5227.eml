long shot and badly wounded a tetel, but lost it in thick thorns; shortly a=
fter, I stalked a nellut (A.=20

Strepsiceros), and bagged it with the Fletcher rifle.  We arrived early in =
camp, and on the following=20

day we moved sixteen miles farther up stream, and camped under a tamarind t=
ree by the side of=20

the river. No European had ever been farther than our last camp, Delladilla=
, and that spot had only=20

been visited by Johann Schmidt and Florian. In the previous year, my aggage=
ers had sabred=20

some of the Base at this very camping-place; they accordingly requested me =
to keep a vigilant=20

watch during the night, as they would be very likely to attack us in reveng=
e, unless they had been=20

scared by the rifles and by the size of our party. They advised me not to r=
emain long in this spot,=20

as it would be very dangerous for my wife to be left almost alone during th=
e day, when we were=20

hunting, and that the Base would be certain to espy us from the mountains, =
and would most=20

probably attack and carry her off when they were assured of our departure. =
She was not very=20

nervous about this, but she immediately called the dragoman, Mahomet, who k=
new the use of a=20

gun, and she asked him if he would stand by her in case they were attacked =
in my absence; the=20

faithful servant replied, "Mahomet fight the Base? No, Missus; Mahomet not =
fight; if the Base=20

come, Missus fight; Mahomet run away; Mahomet not come all the way from Cai=
ro to get him=20

killed by black fellers; Mahomet will run--Inshallah!" (please God).  This =
frank avowal of his military=20

tactics was very reassuring. There was a high hill of basalt, something res=
embling a pyramid,=20

within a quarter of a mile of us; I accordingly ordered some of my men ever=
y day to ascend this=20

look-out station, and I resolved to burn the high grass at once, so as to d=
estroy all cover for the=20

concealment of an enemy. That evening I very nearly burnt our camp; I had s=
everal times ordered=20

the men to clear away the dry grass for about thirty yards from our resting=
-place; this they had=20

neglected to obey. We had been joined a few days before by a party of about=
 a dozen Hamran=20

Arabs, who were hippopotami hunters; thus we mustered very strong, and it w=
ould have been the=20

work of about half an hour to have cleared away the grass as I had desired.=
  The wind was brisk,=20

and blew directly towards our camp, which was backed by the river. I accord=
ingly took a fire-stick,=20

and I told my people to look sharp, as they would not clear away the grass.=
 I mention of an=20

umbrella. He read it over ten times, but it was of no use, he could find no=
 mention of it, unless the=20

following could be considered as such.  "Various useless objects, bought fo=
r two florins by the=20

white Jew."  Perhaps the umbrella was one of those useless objects, and had=
 been bought by the=20

"white Jew." Well, the first thing was to find the "white Jew." But who was=
 he? For in those good=20

old days there were not as many Jews in Hungary as there are now; there wer=
e perhaps one or=20

two in the town, so it was easy to find them; for one was called "red," ano=
ther "gray," another=20

"white," a fourth "black," according to the color of their hair; and by mea=
ns of these four colors the=20

townsfolk were able to distinguish any Jew who lived in their town. But now=
 there were some=20

hundred Jewish families, and heaven had not increased the shades of their h=
air to such an extent=20

that each family could be distinguished in the old way.  It was not difficu=
lt to find out about the old=20

Jew, and Gyuri soon knew that he was called Jonas Muencz, and it was very l=
ikely he had bought=20

the things, for all the coats and vests found their way into his tiny shop =
in Wheat Street, before=20

starting on the second chapter of their existence.  Many people remember th=
e little shop in which=20

top-boots, cloaks, and dresses hung on nails, and the following announcemen=
t was written with=20

chalk on the door:  "Only the lilies of the field can dress themselves chea=
per than you can in this=20

shop!"  (That was quite true, only with this difference, that the lilies of=
 the field were more=20



becomingly dressed than Muencz's customers.)  In spite of all this informat=
ion Gyuri was by no=20

means satisfied, so he walked across the road to his old guardian's to see =
if he could find out=20

anything more on the subject from him, for he had been the first lawyer in =
the town for many years,=20

and must know every one.  The young man told Sztolarik the whole story, ope=
nly and frankly,=20

adding that the receipt for the money, which was probably deposited in some=
 foreign bank, was all=20

but found, for it was most certainly in the handle of the red umbrella, and=
 that had in all probability=20

been bought by an old Jew of the name of Jonas Muencz. All of this Gyuri po=
ured out quickly and=20

breathlessly into the ears of his old guardian.  "That much I know. Now, wh=
at am I to do next?"  "It=20

is a great deal, much more than I ever hoped for. You must continue the sea=
rch."  "But where am I=20

to search? We don't yet=20


_
several places. In an instant the wind swept the flame and smoke towards th=
e camp. All was=20

confusion; the Arabs had piled the camel-saddles and all their corn and eff=
ects in the high grass=20

about twenty yards from the tent; there was no time to remove all these thi=
ngs; therefore, unless=20

they could clear away the grass so as to stop the fire before it should rea=
ch the spot, they would=20

be punished for their laziness by losing their property. The fire travelled=
 quicker than I had=20

expected, and, by the time I had hastened to the tent, I found the entire p=
arty working frantically;=20

the Arabs were slashing down the grass with their swords, and sweeping it a=
way with their shields,=20

while my Tokrooris were beating it down with long sticks and tearing it fro=
m its withered and=20

fortunately tinder-rotten roots, in desperate haste. The flames rushed on, =
and we already felt the=20

heat, as volumes of smoke enveloped us; I thought it advisable to carry the=
 gunpowder (about 20=20

lbs.), down to the river, together with the rifles; while my wife and Mahom=
et dragged the various=20

articles of luggage to the same place of safety. The fire now approached wi=
thin about sixty yards,=20

and dragging out the iron pins, I let the tent fall to the ground. The Arab=
s had swept a line like a=20

highroad perfectly clean, and they were still tearing we had him, who knows=
 on which dust-heap=20

the umbrella has rotted since then?"  "All the same, you must not lose the =
thread."  "Did you know=20

the 'white Jew'?"  "Oh, yes; he was a very honest Jew, that is why he never=
 got very rich. He often=20

came to me; I can see him now, with his head bald at the back, and a fringe=
 of white hair round it.=20

'Pon my word! (and here the lawyer skipped like a young lamb) the last time=
 I saw him he had Pal=20

Gregorics's umbrella in his hand; I can swear to it, and I remember I joked=
 him about it. 'It seems=20

to me, Jonas,' I said, 'that you wander about the next world, too, to buy "=
ole clo'," and bought that=20

umbrella there of Pal Gregorics.' At which he smiled, and said he had not g=
one as far as that yet,=20

for he only kept to the two counties of Zolyom and Hont, and had divided th=
e neighboring counties=20

among his sons; Moricz had Trencsin and Nyitra, Szami had Szepes and Lipto,=
 and the youngest,=20

Kobi, had only last week been given Bars, but they none of them intended to=
 go into the next world=20

until they were obliged to."  Gyuri's eyes shone with delight.  "Bravo, Szt=
olarik!" he exclaimed,=20

"only the gods had such memories as you have."  "You are a lucky fellow, Gy=
uri. I have an=20

impression we are on the right track at last, and that you will find the mo=
ney."  "I begin to think so=20


_
away the grass, when they were suddenly obliged to rush back as the flames =
arrived.  Almost=20

instantaneously the smoke blew over us, but the fire had expired upon meeti=
ng the cleared=20

ground. I now gave them a little lecture upon obedience to orders; and from=
 that day, their first act=20

upon halting for the night was to clear away the grass, lest I should repea=
t the entertainment. In=20

countries that are covered with dry grass, it should be an invariable rule =
to clear the ground around=20

the camp before night; hostile natives will frequently fire the grass to wi=
ndward of a pessimist, as=20

the occasion presented itself.  "But what can have become of old Muencz?"  =
"We Christians have=20

a legend about the Jews which says, that on the Long Day every year a Jew d=
isappears from the=20

earth and is never seen again. Old Jonas disappeared thus fourteen years ag=
o (you may be sure=20

none of the Rothschilds will disappear in that way). His wife and children =
waited for him in vain,=20

Jonas never returned. So his sons set out to look for him, and it turned ou=
t the old fellow had got=20

soft-headed, and had taken to wandering about in the Slovak villages, where=
=20


_
servants may leave their pipes upon the ground, which fanned by the wind wo=
uld quickly create a=20

blaze. That night the mountain afforded a beautiful appearance as the flame=
s ascended the steep=20

sides, and ran flickering up the deep gullies with a brilliant light.  We w=
ere standing outside and=20

then heard of him from people who had seen him; and then one day, they foun=
d his dead body in=20

the Garam."  The young lawyer's face was clouded again.  "Why, in that case=
 the umbrella will be=20

in the Garam too, probably."  "Perhaps not," was the answer. "He may have l=
eft it at home, and=20
