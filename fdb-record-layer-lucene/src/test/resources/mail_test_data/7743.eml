thorn branches, and constructing a zareeba, or fenced camp, to protect our =
animals during the=20

night from the attack of wild beasts. I also hollowed out a thick green bus=
h to form an arbour, as a=20

retreat during the heat of the day, and in a short space of time we were pr=
epared for the reception=20

of the camels and effects. The river had cast up immense stores of dry wood=
; this we had=20

collected, and, by the time the camels arrived with the remainder of our pa=
rty after dark, huge fires=20

were blazing high in air, the light of which had guided them direct to our =
camp. They were heavily=20

laden with meat, which is the Arab's great source of happiness, therefore i=
n a few minutes the=20

whole party was busily employed in cutting the flesh into long thin strips =
to dry; these were hung in=20

festoons over the surrounding trees, while the fires were heaped with tit-b=
its of all descriptions. I=20

had chosen a remarkably snug position for ourselves; the two angareps (stre=
tchers) were neatly=20

arranged in the middle of a small open space free from overhanging boughs; =
near these blazed a=20

large fire, upon which were roasting a row of marrow-bones of buffalo and t=
etel, while the table=20

was spread with a clean cloth, and arranged for dinner.  The woman Barrake,=
 who had discovered=20

with regret that she was not a wife but a servant, had got over the disappo=
intment, and was now=20

making dhurra cakes upon the doka: this is a round earthenware tray about e=
ighteen inches in=20

diameter, which, supported upon three stones or lumps of earth, over a fire=
 of glowing embers,=20

forms a hearth. Slices of liver, well peppered with cayenne and salt, were =
grilling on the gridiron,=20

and we were preparing to dine, when a terrific roar within a hundred and fi=
fty yards informed us=20

that a lion was also thinking of dinner. A confusion of tremendous roars pr=
oceeding from several=20

lions followed the first round, and my aggageers quietly remarked, "There i=
s no danger for the=20

horses to-night, the lions have found your wounded buffalo!"  Such a magnif=
icent chorus of bass=20

voices I had never heard; the jungle cracked, as with repeated roars they d=
ragged the carcase of=20

the buffalo through the thorns to the spot where they intended seemed as th=
ough they had=20

arranged their departure from this world to take place at the same time.  T=
hey found Sranko dead=20

in his bed, the morning after the funeral; he had died of an apoplectic fit=
. Sranko was a well-to-do=20

man, in fact a "magna." (The fifteen richest peasants in a Slovak village a=
re called "magnas" or=20

"magnates.") He had three hundred sheep grazing in his meadows and several =
acres of ploughed=20

land, so he ought to have a grand funeral too. And Mrs. Sranko was not idle=
, for she went herself=20

to the schoolmaster, and then to the priest, and said she wished everything=
 to be as it had been at=20

Mrs. Gongoly's funeral. Let it cost what it might, but the Srankos were not=
 less than the Gongolys.=20

She wished two priests to read the funeral service, and four choir-boys to =
attend in their best black=20

cassocks, the bell was to toll all the time, and so on, and so on. Father J=
anos nodded his head.=20

"Very well, all shall be as you wish," he said, and then proceeded to recko=
n out what it would cost.=20

"That's all right," said Mrs. Sranko, "but please, your reverence, put the =
red thing in too, and let us=20

see how much more it will cost."  "What red thing?"  "Why, what you held ov=
er your head at Mrs.=20

Gongoly's funeral. Oh, it _was_ lovely!"  The young priest could not help s=
miling.  "But that is=20

impossible," he said.  Mrs. Sranko jumped up, and planted herself before hi=
m, with her arms=20

crossed.  "And why is it impossible I should like to know? My money is as g=
ood as the Gongolys',=20

isn't it?"  "But, my dear Mrs. Sranko, it was raining then, and to-morrow w=
e shall in all probability=20

have splendid weather."  But it was no use arguing with the good woman, for=
 she spoke the dialect=20

of the country better than Father Janos did.  "Raining, was it?" she exclai=
med. "Well, all the more=20

reason you should bring it with you to-morrow, your honor; at all events it=
 won't get wet. And, after=20



all, my poor dear husband was worthy of it; he was no worse than Mrs. Gongo=
ly. Every one=20

honored him, and he did a lot for the Church; why, it was he who five years=
 ago sent for those=20

lovely colored candles we have on the altar; they came all the way from Bes=
ztercebanya. And the=20

white=20


_
to devour it. That which was music to our ears was discord to that of Mahom=
et, who with terror in=20

hs face came to us and exclaimed: "Master, what's that? What for master and=
 the missus come to=20

this bad country? That's one bad kind will eat the missus in the night! Per=
haps he come and eat=20

Mahomet!" This after-thought was too much for him, and Bacheet immediately =
comforted him by=20

telling the most horrible tales of death and destruction that had been wrou=
ght by lions, until the=20

nerves of Mahomet were completely unhinged.  This was a signal for story-te=
lling, when suddenly=20

the aggageers changed the conversation by a few tales of the Base natives, =
which so thoroughly=20

eclipsed the dangers of wild beasts, that in a short time the entire party =
would almost have=20

welcomed a lion, provided would he only have agreed to protect them from th=
e Base. In this very=20

spot where we were then camped, a party of Arab hunters had, two years prev=
ious, been=20

surprised at night and killed by the Base, who still boasted of the swords =
that they possessed as=20

spoils from that occasion. The Base knew this spot as the favourite resting=
-place of the Hamran=20

hunting-parties, and they might be not far distant now, as we were in the h=
eart of their country.=20

This intelligence was a regular damper to the spirits of some of the party.=
 Mahomet quietly retired=20

and sat down by Barrake, the ex-slave woman, having expressed a resolution =
to keep awake=20

every hour that he should be compelled to remain in that horrible country. =
The lions roared louder=20

and louder, but no one appeared to notice such small thunder; all thoughts =
were fixed upon the=20

Base, so thoroughly had the aggageers succeeded in frightening not only Mah=
omet, but also our=20

Tokrooris.   CHAPTER XIII.  THE LIONS FIND THE BUFFALO.  EARLY on the follo=
wing morning=20

the lions were still roaring, apparently within a hundred yards of the camp=
. I accordingly took a=20

Reilly No. 10 have a right to the red thing."  "But I can't make myself rid=
iculous by burying some=20

one with an umbrella held over me when the sun is shining. You must give up=
 the idea, Mrs.=20

Sranko."  Thereupon Mrs. Sranko burst into tears. What had she done to be p=
ut to such shame,=20

and to be refused the right to give her husband all the honors due to the d=
ead, and which were a=20

comfort to the living too? What would the villagers say of her? They would =
say, "Mrs. Sranko did=20

not even give her husband a decent funeral, they only threw him into the gr=
ave like a beggar."=20

"Please do it, your reverence," she begged tearfully, and kept on wiping he=
r eyes with her=20

handkerchief, until one of the corners which had been tied in a knot came u=
nfastened, and out fell=20

a ten-florin note. Mrs. Sranko picked it up, and put it carefully on the ta=
ble.  "I'll give this over and=20

above the other sum," she said, "only let us have all the pomp possible, yo=
ur honor."  At this=20

moment Widow Adamecz rushed in from the kitchen, flourishing an immense woo=
den spoon in the=20

air.  "Yes, your reverence, Sranko was a good, pious man; not all the gossi=
p you hear about him is=20

true. And even if it were, it would touch Mrs. Gongoly as much as him, may =
God rest her soul. If=20

the holy umbrella was used at her funeral, it can be used at his too. If Go=
d is angry at its having=20

been used for her, He will only be a little more angry at its being used fo=
r him; and if He was not=20

angry then, He won't be angry now either."  "You ought to be ashamed of you=
rself, Widow=20

Adamecz, talking such nonsense. Don't bother me any more with your supersti=
tions. The whole=20

thing is simply ridiculous."  But the two women were not to be put off.  "W=
e know what we know,"=20

they said, nodding their heads sagely, "your honor can't deceive us."  And =
they worried him to=20

such an extent that he was obliged at last to give way, and agreed to bring=
 the red umbrella to=20

Janos=20
