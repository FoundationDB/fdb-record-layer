puzzling the generations of a future white race of unbelievers yet unborn! Anyhow, the papyri are 

full of Magic, as are likewise the stelae. We learn, moreover, that the papyrus was not merely a 

smooth-surfaced parchment, a fabric made of       Ligneous matter from a shrub, the pellicles of 

which superposed     one over the other formed a kind of writing-paper;   but that the shrub itself, 

the implements and tools for fabricating the parchment, etc., were all previously subjected to a 

process of magical preparation--according to the ordinance of the Gods, who had taught that art, 

as they had all others, to their Priest-Hierophants.  There are, however, some modern Orientalists 

who seem to have an inkling of the true nature of such things, and especially of the analogy and 

the relations that exist between the Magic of old and our modern-day phenomena. Chabas is one 

of these, for he indulges, in his translation of the "Harris" papyrus, in the following reflections: 

Without having recourse to the imposing ceremonies of the wand of     Hermes, or to the obscure 

formulae of an unfathomable mysticism, a     mesmerizer in our own day will, by means of a few 

passes, disturb     the organic faculties of a subject, inculcate the knowledge of     foreign 

languages, transport him to a far-distant country, or into   as to the state of affairs; that his orders 

are not respected like those of our former bugbear, the deceased cardinal, whose portrait as you 

see hangs yonder--for whatever may be thought of him, it must be allowed that Richelieu was 

great."  "I will not contradict you there," said D'Artagnan.  "My first impressions were favorable to 

the minister; I said to myself that a minister is never loved, but that with the genius this one was 

said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared, which 

in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved----"  D'Artagnan made a sign with his 

head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim.  "This, then," continued 

Aramis, "was my first opinion; but as I am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility 

which I profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment, but to ask the opinion of others, I have 

inquired--Eh!--my friend----"  Aramis paused.  "Well? what?" asked his friend.  "Well, I must mortify 

myself. I must confess that I was mistaken. Monsieur de Mazarin is not a man of genius, as I 

thought, he is a man of no origin--once a servant of Cardinal Bentivoglio, and he got on by 

intrigue. He is an upstart, a man of no name, who will only be the tool of a party in France. He will 

amass wealth, he

in closed letters, etc.... The antre of the modern sybil is a     modest-looking room, the tripod has 

made room for a small round     table, a hat, a plate, a piece of furniture of the most vulgar     kind; 

only the latter is even superior to the oracle of antiquity     [how does M. Chabas know?], inasmuch 

as the latter only     spoke,(454) while the oracle of our day writes its answers. At the     command 

of the medium the spirits of the revenue and pay to himself the pensions which Richelieu paid to 

others. He is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling, but a sort of buffoon, a punchinello, a 

pantaloon. Do you know him? I do not."  "Hem!" said D'Artagnan, "there is some truth in what you 

say."  "Ah! it fills me with pride to find that, thanks to a common sort of penetration with which I am 

endowed, I am approved by a man like you, fresh from the court."  "But you speak
