dracaena marginata blaze of hot wrath, the tribute of the shepherds to the =

ecurring to _
sleeping dawn. Like a mightier than himself, he will rise a great while bef=
ore day, and the clear=20

notes of the rude lyre, his companion in all his wanderings, will summon th=
e morning to add its=20

silent speech to His praise. But a still loftier thought inspires him. This=
 hunted solitary not only=20

knows that his deliverance is certain, but he has already the consciousness=
 of a world-wide=20

vocation, and anticipates that the story of his sorrow and his trust, with =
the music of his psalms,=20

belong to the world, and will flow over the barriers of his own generation =
and of his own land into=20

the whole earth--     (9) I will praise Thee among the peoples, O Lord,    =
    I will strike the harp to=20

Thee among the nations.    (10) For great unto the heavens is Thy mercy,   =
     And to the clouds=20

Thy truth.  These two mighty messengers of God, whose coming he was sure of=
 (ver. 3), will show=20

themselves in his deliverance, boundless and filling all the creation. They=
 shall be the theme of his=20

world-wide praise. And then with the repetition of the refrain the psalm co=
mes round again to=20

supplication, and dies into silent waiting before God till He shall be plea=
sed to answer. Thus=20

triumphant were the hopes of the lonely fugitive skulking in the wilderness=
; such bright visions=20

peopled the waste places, and made the desert to rejoice and blossom as the=
 rose.  The cxlii. is=20

also, according to the title, one of the cave-psalms. But considerable doub=
t attaches to the whole=20

group of so-called Davidic compositions in the last book of the psalter (p.=
 138-144), from their=20

place, and from the fact that there are just seven of them, as well as in s=
ome cases from their style=20

and character. They are more probably later hymns in David's manner. The on=
e in question=20

corresponds in tone with the psalms which we have been considering. It brea=
thes the same=20

profound consciousness of desolation and loneliness: "My spirit is darkened=
 within me;" "Refuge=20

fails me, no man cares for my soul." It glows with the same ardour of perso=
nal trust in and love to=20

God which spring from his very loneliness and helplessness: "I cry unto The=
e, O Jehovah! I say=20

Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living." It triumphs w=
ith the same confidence,=20

and with the same conviction that his deliverance concerns all the righteou=
s: "They shall _crown=20

know which we love most, our seats or our mistresses. There is a general di=
sposition on the part=20

of the lavender-gloved tribe to resent the extra wear and tear of mind sudd=
enly imposed upon=20

them this hot weather. Why should they unexpectedly be called away from the=
 corners devoted to=20

_tete-a-tetes_, to stand on hotel balconies, and stammer, in unintelligible=
 language, their views=20

upon Reform to crowds of free and independent electors? "For goodness' sake=
," says Larkington=20

to Lady Veriphast, "give me some ideas; I've got to go and meet these wretc=
hed constituents of=20

mine, and I had promised myself a much more agreeable occupation with you a=
t Richmond.=20

Couldn't you get Veriphast to go down? I should be delighted to retire in h=
is favour; and with his=20

abilities it is ridiculous his not being in Parliament."  "How absurdly you=
 talk about my persuading=20

Veriphast to do anything? the only person, as you know, who has any influen=
ce over him is Mrs=20

Loveton," responds her ladyship, with a sigh--arising from dyspepsia.  "I h=
ave hit it;" and for a=20

moment Larkington looks animated. "Squabbleton is close to the coast, and w=
e will make a party,=20

and I will take you all round in my yacht, the Lovetons and you and Veripha=
st; we'll go and do the=20

electioneering business together, and keep the yacht as a sort of _pied a t=
erre_, or rather _pied a=20

mer_;" and Larkington chuckled, partly at his joke, and partly at this bril=
liant solution of his=20

dilemma.  And so, while all the world is trying to reconcile their pleasure=
 with what they are=20

pleased to term their duty, being always the duty they owe to themselves, m=
y thoughts are=20

diverted into a very different channel. I am beginning daily to feel, while=
 in the world, that I am less=20



of it. Already I have cut myself off from the one great source of interest =
which Parliament afforded=20

me, and I have not succeeded in my love as a compensation--that is why Lark=
ington's=20

arrangement to secure both seemed a sort of mockery of my misery. For it wa=
s impossible to=20

resist the occasional fits of depression which reduced my mind to the condi=
tion of white paper, and=20

the world to that of a doll stuffed with sawdust. I was suffering in this m=
anner the day following the=20

evening entertainment at Lady Broadhem's, which I have already described. T=
he interview which=20

impended inspired me with vague=20


_
such would appear to be the true meaning of the word rendered in our versio=
n "compass me=20

about;" the idea being that the mercy of God to the psalmist would become a=
 source of festal=20

gladness to all His servants, who would bind the story of God's bounty to h=
im upon their brows like=20

a coronal for a banquet.     VIII.--THE EXILE--_CONTINUED_.   As our purpos=
e in this volume is=20

not a complete biography, it will not be necessary to dwell on the subseque=
nt portions of the exile,=20

inasmuch as there is little reference to these in the psalms. We must pass =
over even that exquisite=20

episode of Abigail, whose graceful presence and "most subtle flow of silver=
-paced counsel"=20

soothed David's ruffled spirit, and led him captive at once as in a silken =
leash. The glimpse of old-

world ways in the story, the rough mirth of the shearers, the hint of the k=
ind of black mail by which=20

David's little force was provided, the snarling humour and garrulous forwar=
d to it with positive=20

enjoyment. There is no greater bore than to get up morally and physically u=
nhinged, upon the very=20

day that you expect an unusual strain upon your faculties. The days it does=
 not matter, you feel up=20

to anything; but nature too often perversely deserts you at the most critic=
al moment.  Now, upon=20

the morning in question it was necessary as a preliminary measure for me to=
 go into the City and=20

acquire some information essential to the success of my interview with Lady=
 Broadhem, but before=20

starting I was anxious to gain a few particulars from Grandon, the knowledg=
e of which would=20

materially aid me in disentangling the complicated skein of our joint affai=
rs. I therefore looked in=20

upon him for a moment _en passant_.  "I went to Lady Broadhem's last night,=
 Grandon," I said,=20

"and I have reasons for wishing to know whether you have had any communicat=
ion with the family=20

lately. I think the time is coming when I shall be=20
