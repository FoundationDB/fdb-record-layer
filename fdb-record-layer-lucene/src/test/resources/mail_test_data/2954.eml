directed him to go to a remote portion of the State beyond the Lost River Mountains to examine 

the papers in a right-of-way case which was coming up for trial at the next term of court. This was 

in Kittredge's department, and Blount called the superintendent on the phone. Kittredge was in his 

office, and he evidently knew about the vice-president's telegram. Also, he seemed anxious to 

have the division counsel go to Lewiston at once; so anxious that he offered his own luxuriant 

foliage. Now we have it at its best!" exclaimed the commander.  "What do we have? I don't see 

anything."  "We have Mount Serbal, which some believe is the genuine Mount Sinai," continued 

the commander, as he pointed out the loftiest peak in sight, and which was readily distinguished 

from all others.  All the passengers had by this time gathered near him; for all of them were 

anticipating a sight at the lofty height which had given a name to the peninsula, though

run as a special train.  Blount saw no way to evade a positive order from the vice-president, but he 

was more than suspicious that Gantry or Kittredge, or possibly both of them, had misrepresented 

the right-of-way case to Mr. McVickar, in an attempt to get him away from the city and so to 

postpone a reiteration of the demand for a new freight tariff. What he did not suspect was that Mr. 

McVickar's telegram might possibly have originated in Kittredge's office.  Asking the 

superintendent to have the service-car made ready immediately, he packed his handbag, left a 

note for Patricia, who was not yet visible, and another for Gantry, who was not in his office, and 

began the roundabout journey.  In all his travelling up and down the State he had never found 

anything to equal the slowness of the special train. The noon meal, served by Kittredge's cook in 

the open compartment, found the special less than fifty miles on its way, and comfortably waiting 

at that about it in "Stephens's Travels" sixty years ago.  "That mountain is the highest on the 

peninsula; and if it is not the real Mount Sinai, where the law was delivered to Moses, some insist 

that it ought to be, for they say it is loftier, grander, nobler, and more worthy the great event than 

the one which is generally assigned as its location," said the captain. "As you have been informed 

before, Serbal is 8,712 feet high."  Mrs. Blossom did not appear to be satisfied. Evidently she 

desired to "gush" over the Holy Mountain; but the doubt as to "which was which," as she stated it, 

bothered her very seriously, and she was not at all friendly to the "pesky Bible critics," who had 

raised the doubt as to its identity.  "Jebel Musa!" shouted the commander a couple of hours later; 

and the party gathered around him again.  "What on earth is that?" demanded the good lady. 

"Keep cool, Sarah," said Mrs. Belgrave to her. "The captain will tell you all about it in due

side-track among the sage-brush hills for the coming of a delayed train in the opposite direction. 

Four mortal hours were lost on the lonely siding. There was no station, and Blount could not 

telegraph. So far as he knew, the service-car might stay there for a day or a week. It was all to no 

purpose that he quarrelled with his conductor. The train crew had orders to wait for the  "Jebel, or 

gebel, means a mountain in Arabic; Musa is sometimes spelled Moosa; and the whole name, I 

suppose, is 'Mountain of Moses,'" the commander explained as soon as he had enabled every one 

to see the peak that went by this name. "In other words, that is what nearly everybody who knows 

anything about the matter believes to be the true Mount Sinai."  "Mount Sinai!" almost
