thought a hopeless task. The next thing desired was, that I should get clear evidence of its former 

existence, its provisions, and bequests. It was also desired that I should get evidence enough to

awfully embarrassed by my inquiries, and immediately I thought it wise to let her know the real 

object of my visit, she fancied herself a delinquent. "Upon my word, sir," she said, "I didn't take it.
