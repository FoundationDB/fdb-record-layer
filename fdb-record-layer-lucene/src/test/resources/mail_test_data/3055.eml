f the human AEons,=20

from the very dawn of Occult Wisdom, the regions that the men of Science fi=

leaning on a table, and said, 'there is the person to be executed.'"  "Horr=

you obeyed?"  "Father, that woman was a monster. It was said that she had p=
oisoned her second=20

husband; she had tried to assassinate her brother-in-law; she had just pois=
oned a young woman=20

who was her rival, and before leaving England she had, it was believed, cau=
sed the favorite of the=20

king to be murdered."  "Buckingham?" cried the monk.  "Yes, Buckingham."  "=
The woman was=20

English, then?"  "No, she was French, but she=20

The monk turned pale, wiped his brow and went and bolted the door. The exec=

he had abandoned him and fell back, groaning, upon his bed.  "No, no; I am =
here," said the monk,=20

quickly coming back to him. "Go on; who were those men?"  "One of them was =
a foreigner,=20

English, I think. The four others were French and wore the uniform of muske=
teers."  "Their=20

names?" asked the monk.  "I don't know them, but the four other noblemen ca=

'my lord.'"  "Was the woman handsome?"  "Young and beautiful. Oh, yes, espe=

all over; he seemed=20

"The name of that woman?" he said.  "I don't know what it was. As I have sa=
id, she was twice=20

married, once in France, the second time in England."  "She was young, you =
say?"  "Twenty-five=20

years old."  "Beautiful?"  "Ravishingly."  "Blond?"  "Yes."  "Abundance of =
hair--falling over her=20

shoulders?"  "Yes."  "Eyes of an admirable expression?"  "When she chose. O=
