LORD MAYOR NOT A PRIVY COUNCILLOR.  (Vol. iv., pp. 9. 137. 180.)  In p. 180=
. I find some=20

observations respecting the rank of the Lord Mayor of London, which seem to=
 require further=20

elucidation. But I should not trouble you except for one passage, which lea=
ds me to think that the=20

writer is under some little mistake. He seems to think that upon the occasi=
on of a new king's=20

accession, only Privy Councillors are summoned. This is not so. I remember =
upon the accession=20

of George IV., that I received a summons, being then a member of the House =
of Commons and=20

holding an official appointment; and some other private gentlemen were also=
 summoned. I _think_=20

that the summonses were issued from the Home Office, but of this I am not c=
ertain; nor do I know=20

if the same practice has been adopted upon the subsequent accessions. I rem=
ember that we all=20

met at Carlton House; that we all signed some document, recognising the new=
 sovereign, which I=20

apprehend to be the authority for the proclamation; but that the _Privy Cou=
ncillors only_ went in to=20

the presence.  I understand that the theory for summoning me and others was=
 that some persons=20

of various ranks and grades of society should concur in If a man undertakes=
 to carve game or a=20

roast he should learn to do it well and quietly, _never_ sharpening his kni=
fe to the annoyance of=20

his guests or rising from his seat for a better =E2=80=9Chold.=E2=80=9D Man=
y women carve excellently, but as there is=20

a feeling that it is a difficult thing to do, a clever guest who knows his =
hostess well, will sometimes=20

beg leave to take her place for the performance of this task. When the host=
ess begins to eat, the=20

others follow her example. All food must be eaten slowly, and, above all, n=
oiselessly. Many a=20

fastidious person has had her enjoyment of her soup spoiled by the audible =
sipping of it by her vis-

=C3=A0-vis or her next neighbor. The soup should be lifted from the plate b=
y an outward sweep of the=20

spoon, and taken quietly from the side, not the tip, of the spoon. It is ba=
d form to break bread or=20

crackers into the soup, and the plate containing the liquid should never be=
 tipped in order to obtain=20

every drop of the contents.         *       *       *       *       *  Fish=
 is not to be touched with the knife.=20

There is reason for this. The cutting of some delicate sea-food with a stee=
l knife affects the flavor=20

of it, and renders it less delicate. The flesh is so tender that it may be =
cut with a silver fork, and this=20

is the only implement permitted in its manipulation. The same rule applies =
to salads, which are=20

never, by the followers of=20


_
the new king upon the throne.  All this is, however, mere speculation of my=
 own. The _fact_ of my=20

summons is certain. As to the Lord Mayor being Right Honorable, why need we=
 look for other=20

authority than usage? Usage only gives the title of Right Honorable to a Pr=
ivy Councillor being a=20

Commoner. Usage only gives that title to a Peer. Excuse this gossip.      D=
