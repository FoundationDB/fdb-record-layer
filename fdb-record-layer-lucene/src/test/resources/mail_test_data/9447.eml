Putin doesn't. Last year, riding the tidal wave of the fight against terror=
, he formed the Financial=20

crimes, aided by brand new laws and a small army of trained and tenacious a=
ccountants under the=20

aegis of the Ministry of Finance.  Really, it is intended to circumvent irr=

Exchange Market  Russians, the skeptics that they are, still keep most of t=
heir savings (c. $40-50=20

billion) in foreign exchange (predominantly US dollars), stuffed in mattres=
ses and other exotic=20

places. Prices are often quoted in dollars and ATM's spew forth both dollar=
s and rubles. This=20

predilection for the greenback was aided greatly by the Central Bank's pani=
cky advice (reported by=20

Moscow Times) to ditch all European currencies prior to January 1, 2002. Th=

and hitherto minor diversification to euros. Banks are reporting increased =

 creeping devaluation of the=20

ruble, in line with inflation. Foreign exchange is traded in eight exchange=

 What's Next?  No modern=20

country, however self-deluded and backward, can survive without a banking s=

Bank's pernicious and overwhelming presence virtually guarantees a repeat o=

of the banking system may collapse, Russian securities will be dumped, Russ=

point of actual reform.  In the eventuality of a confluence between this fi=

Russia's entry to the WTO - the crisis is bound to become more ominous. Rus=
sia is on the verge=20

of opening itself to real competition from the West - including (perhaps es=
pecially so) in the=20

financial sector. It is revamping its law books - but does not have the adm=
inistrative mechanism it=20

takes to implement them. It has a rich tradition of obstructionism, venalit=

history is a chaotic battle between centrifugal and centripetal forces - be=
tween its 50 oblasts=20

(regions), 2 cities (Moscow and St. Petersburg), 6 krais (territories), 21 =
republics, and 10 okrugs=20

(departments) - and the often cash-strapped and graft-ridden paternalistic =
center. The vast land=20

national homelands to Russia's numerous minorities - have their own constit=
utions and elected=20

presidents (since 1991). Oblasts and krais are run by elected governors (a =
novelty - governors=20

have been appointed by Yeltsin until 1997). They are patchy fiefdoms compos=
ed of autonomous=20

okrugs. "The Economist" observes that the okrugs (often populated with memb=
ers of an ethnic=20

minority) are either very rich (e.g., Yamal-Nenets in Tyumen, with 53% of R=

Perhaps the lapse from good breeding most common in general society is the =

One is aghast at the evidence of impertinent curiosity that parades under t=

(ranked #1 in creditworthiness), Samara, Tyumen, Sverdlovsk, Tatarstan, Per=

Novgorod, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, and St. Petersburg (Putin's lair). As a res=

Moscow attracted over 50% of all FDI and domestic investment and St. Peters=

or withheld their own public services (roads, security, housing, heating, h=

exacerbated this trend. He lost his right to appoint governors in 1997 - an=

(there were three such=20

issues in 1997). Many regions cut red tape, introduced transparent bookkeep=

investors with tax breaks, and liberalized land ownership.  Bikalova (IMF) =
identifies three major=20

problems in the fiscal relationship between centre and regions in the Yelts=

of an objective normative basis for allocating budget revenues, (2) the lac=

 submit a package of=20

laws to the State Duma in May 2000. The crux of the proposed legislation wa=
s to endow the=20

President with the power to sack regional elected officials at will. The al=
armed governors forgot=20

their petty squabbles and in a rare show of self-interested unity fenced th=

The President can fire a governor, said the final version, only if a court =
rules that the latter failed to=20

incorporate federal legislation in regional laws, or if charged with seriou=

wholesale dismissal of regional legislatures requires the approval of the S=
tate Duma. Some=20

republics insist that even these truncated powers are excessive and Russia'=
s Constitutional Court=20

is currently weighing their arguments.  Putin then resorted to another stra=
tagem. He established,=20

two years ago, by decree, a bureaucratic layer between centre and regions: =
seven administrative=20

mega-regions whose role is to make sure that federal laws are both adopted =
and enforced at the=20

to tradesmen of every sort is the mark of a =E2=80=9Clady,=E2=80=9D the wor=

sense to which, alas! we have grown a little callous. While a customer has =
the right measurably to=20

see what a shop affords before she makes her choice, she has no right to gi=
ve a clerk the trouble=20

of taking out everything when she has no intention of buying. If she gives =
much trouble before her=20

or his extra labor. The=20

fact that he is paid for his time does not make this duty the less.  Alterc=
ations with clerks and other=20

e, to keep watch over the=20

articles sold. To do this it is not necessary, however, to watch the custom=
