surface, with which asphalt and with burnt brick Semiramis built the wall surrounding Babylon. At 

Jaffa in Syria and among the Nomads in Arabia, are lakes of enormous size that yield very large 

masses of asphalt, which are carried off by the inhabitants thereabouts.  9. There is nothing 

marvellous in this, for quarries of hard asphalt are numerous there. So, when a quantity of water 

bursts its way through the asphaltic soil, it carries asphalt out with it, and after passing out of the 

ground, the water is separated and so rejects the asphalt from itself. Again, in Cappadocia on the 

road from Mazaca to Tyana, there is an extensive lake into which if a part of a reed or of some 

other thing be plunged, and withdrawn the next day, it will be found that the part thus withdrawn 

has turned into stone, while the part which remained above water retains its original nature.  10. In 

the same way, at Hierapolis in Phrygia there is a multitude of boiling hot springs from which water 

is let into ditches surrounding gardens and vineyards, and this water becomes an incrustation of 

stone at the end of a year. Hence, every year they construct banks of earth to the right and left, let 

in the water, and thus out of these incrustations make walls for their fields. This seems due to 

natural causes, since there is a juice having a coagulating potency like rennet underground in 

those spots and in that country. When this potency appears above ground mingled with spring 

water, the mixture cannot but be hardened by the heat of the sun and air, as appears in salt pits. 

11. There are also springs which issue exceedingly bitter, owing to a bitter juice in the soil, such as 

the river Hypanis in Pontus. For about forty miles from its source its taste is very sweet; then it 

reaches a point about one hundred and sixty miles from its mouth, where it is joined by a very 

small brook. This runs into it, and at once makes that vast river bitter, for the reason that the water 

of the brook becomes bitter by flowing through the kind of soil and the veins in which there are 

sandarach mines.  12. These waters are given their different flavours by the properties of the soil, 

as is also seen in the case of fruits. If the roots of trees, vines, or other plants did not produce their 

fruits by drawing juices from soil of different properties, the flowers of all would be of the same kind 

in all places and districts. But we find in the island of Lesbos the protropum wine, in Maeonia, the 

In the morning the corridor attendant brings me tea and a copy of the local newspaper. 

Mechanically I read the advertisements on the first page, the leading article, the extracts from the 

newspapers and journals, the chronicle of events.... In the latter I find, among other things, the 

following paragraph: "Our distinguished savant, Professor Nikolay Stepanovitch So-and-so, 

arrived yesterday in Harkov, and is staying in the So-and-so Hotel."  Apparently, illustrious names 

are created to live on their own account, apart from those that bear them. Now my name is 

promenading tranquilly about Harkov; in another three months, printed in gold letters on my 

monument, it will shine bright as the sun itself, while I shall be already under the moss.  A light tap 

at the door. Somebody wants me.  "Who is there? Come in."  The door opens, and I step back 

surprised and hurriedly wrap my dressing-gown round me. Before me stands Katya.  "How do you 

do?" she says, breathless with running upstairs. "You didn't expect me? I have come here, too.... I 

have come, too!"  She sits down and goes on, hesitating and not looking at me.  "Why don't you 

speak to me? I have come, too... today.... I found out that you were in this hotel, and have come to 

you."  "Very glad to see you," I say, shrugging my shoulders, "but I am surprised. You seem to 

have dropped from the skies. What have you come for?"  "Oh... I've simply come."  Silence. 

Suddenly she jumps up impulsively and comes to me.  "Nikolay Stepanovitch," she says, turning 

pale and pressing her hands on her bosom--"Nikolay Stepanovitch, I cannot go on living like this! I 



cannot! For God's sake tell me quickly, this minute, what I am to do! Tell me, what am I to do?" 

"What can I tell you?" I ask in perplexity. "I can do nothing."  "Tell me, I beseech you," she goes 

on, breathing hard and trembling all over. "I swear that I cannot go on living like this. It's too much 

for me!"  She sinks on a chair and begins sobbing. She flings her head back, wrings her hands, 

taps with her feet; her hat falls off and hangs bobbing on its elastic; her hair is ruffled.  "Help me! 

help me!" she implores me. "I cannot go on!"  She takes her handkerchief out of her travelling-bag, 

and with it pulls out several letters, which fall from her lap to the floor. I pick them up, and on one 

of them I recognize the handwriting of Mihail Fyodorovitch and accidentally read a bit of a word 

"passionat..."  "There is nothing I can tell you, Katya," I say.

the Tmolian, in Sicily, the Mamertine, in Campania, the Falernian, between Terracina and Fondi, 

the Caecuban, and wines of countless varieties and qualities produced in many other places. This 

could not be the case, were it not that the juice of the soil, introduced with its proper flavours into 

the roots, feeds the stem, and, mounting along it to the top, imparts a flavour to the fruit which is 

peculiar to its situation and kind.  13. If soils were not different and unlike in their kinds of juices, 

Syria and Arabia would not be the only places in which the reeds, rushes, and all the plants are 

aromatic, and in which there are trees bearing frankincense or yielding pepper berries and lumps 

of myrrh, nor would assafoetida be found only in the stalks growing in Cyrene, but everything 

would be of the same sort, and produced in the soil of all countries. It is the inclination of the 

firmament and the force of the sun, as it draws nearer or recedes in its course, that make these 

diversities such as we find them in different countries and places, through the nature of the soil 

and it's juices. And not only in the case of the things mentioned, but also in that of sheep and 

cattle. These diversities would not exist if the different properties of soils and their juices were not 

qualified by the power of the sun.  14. For instance, there are in  "Help me!" she sobs, clutching at 

my hand and kissing it. "You are my father, you know, my only friend! You are clever, educated; 

you have lived so long; you have been a teacher! Tell me, what am I to do?"  "Upon my word, 

Katya, I don't know...."  I am utterly at a loss and confused, touched by her sobs, and hardly able 

to stand.  "Let us have lunch, Katya," I say, with a forced smile. "Give over crying."  And at once I 

add in a sinking voice:  "I shall soon be gone, Katya...."  "Only one word, only one word!" she 

weeps, stretching out her hands to me.  "What am I to do?"  "You are a queer girl, really..." I 

mutter. "I don't understand it! So sensible, and all at once crying your eyes out...."  A silence 

follows. Katya straightens her hair, puts on her hat, then crumples up the letters and stuffs them in 

her bag--and all this deliberately, in silence. Her face, her bosom, and her gloves are wet with 

tears, but her expression now is cold and forbidding.... I look at her, and feel ashamed that I am 

happier than she. The absence of what my philosophic colleagues call a general idea I have 

detected in myself only just before death, in the decline of my days, while the soul of this poor girl 

has known and will know no refuge all her life, all her life!  "Let us have lunch, Katya," I say.  "No, 

thank you," she answers coldly. Another minute

Lucania, the Crathis, in Troy, the Xanthus, and certain springs in the country of the Clazomenians, 

the Erythraeans, and the Laodiceans. When sheep are ready for breeding at the proper season of 

the year, they are driven every day during that season to those rivers to drink, and the result is 

that, however white they may be, they beget in some places whity-brown "I don't like Harkov," I 

say; "it's so grey here--such a grey town."  "Yes, perhaps.... It's ugly. I am here not for long, 

passing through. I am going on today."  "Where?"  "To the Crimea... that is, to the Caucasus." 

"Oh! For long?"  "I don't know."  Katya gets up, and, with a cold smile, holds out her hand without 

looking at me.  I want to ask her, "Then, you
