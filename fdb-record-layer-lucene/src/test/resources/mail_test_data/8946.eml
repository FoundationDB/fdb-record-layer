"I haven't observed any alarming absence of health in my children," I found=
 the courage to say.=20

But a tightness gathered about my heart, for I could sniff what was coming.=
  "They may be all right,=20

as far as that goes," persisted their lordly parent. "But what I say is, to=
o much cuddling and=20

mollycoddling isn't good for that boy of yours, or anybody else's boy." And=
 he proceeded to explain=20

that my Dinkie was an ordinary, every-day, normal child and should be accep=
ted and treated as=20

such or we'd have a temperamental little bounder on our hands.  I knew that=
 my boy wasn't=20

abnormal. But I knew, on the other hand, that he was an exceptionally impre=
ssionable and=20

sensitive child. And I couldn't be sorry for that, for if there's anything =
I abhor in this world it's torpor.=20

And whatever he may have majority do not concur in scouting so untenable a =
proposition.  "My=20

dear Baron,  "Yours sincerely,  "PALMERSTON  "The Baron de Stockmar"  That =
the House of=20

Commons cannot turn women into men is a position not so unquestioned now as=
 it was in=20

Palmerston's day.  Stockmar now left England for a time, but he kept his ey=
e on English affairs, to=20

his continued interest in which we owe it seems, the publication of a rathe=
r curious document, the=20

existence of which in manuscript was, however, well known. It is a Memoir o=
f King William IV.,=20

purporting to be drawn up by himself, and extending over the eventful years=
 of 1830-35 'King=20

William's style,' says the uncourtly biographer, "abounds to overflowing in=
 what is called in=20

England Parliamentary circumlocution, in which, instead of direct, simple=
=20


_
me in my firm conviction that a child's own mother is the best person to wa=
tch over his growth and=20

shape his character.  "But what is all this leading up to?" I asked, steeli=
ng myself for the=20

unwelcome.  "Simply to what I've already told you on several occasions," wa=
s my husband's=20

answer. "That it's about time this boy of ours was bundled off to a boardin=
g-school."  I sat back,=20

trying to picture my home and my life without Dinkie. But it was unbearable=
. It was unthinkable.  "I=20

shall never agree to that," I quietly retorted.  "Why?" asked my husband, w=
ith a note of triumph=20

which I resented.  "For one thing, because he is still a child, because he =
is too young," I=20

contended, knowing that I could never agree with Dinky-Dunk in his thorough=
ly English ideas of=20

education even while I remembered how he had once said that the greatness o=
f England=20

depended on her public-schools, such as Harrow and Eton and Rugby and Winch=
ester, and that=20

she had been the best colonizer in the world because her boys had been take=
n young and taught=20

not to overvalue home ties, had been made manlier by getting off with their=
 own kind instead of=20

remaining hitched to an apron-string.  "And you prefer keeping him stuck ou=
t here on the prairie?"=20

demanded Dinky-Dunk.  "The prairie has been good enough for his parents, th=
is last seven or=20

eight years," I contended.  "It hasn't been good enough for me," my husband=
 cried out with quite=20

unlooked-for passion. "And I've about had my fill of it!"  "Where would you=
 prefer going?" I asked,=20

trying to speak as quietly as I could.  "That's something I'm going to find=
 out as soon as the=20

chance comes," he retorted with a slow and embittered emphasis which didn't=
 add any to my=20

peace of mind.  "Then why cross our bridges," I suggested, "until we come t=
o them?"  "But you're=20

not looking for bridges," he bombastic paraphrases are always chosen, which=
 become in the end=20

intolerably prolix and dull, and are enough to drive a foreigner to despair=
." The style is indeed=20

august; but the real penman is not the King, whose strong point was not gra=
mmatical composition,=20

but some confidant, very likely Sir Herbert Taylor, who was employed by the=
 King to negotiate with=20

the "waverers" in the House of Lords, and get the Reform Bill passed withou=
t a swamping creation=20

of peers. The Memoir contains nothing of the slightest historical importanc=
e. It is instructive only as=20

showing how completely a constitutional king may be under the illusion of h=
is office--how=20

complacently he may fancy that he is himself guiding the State, when he is =
in fact merely signing=20

what is put before him by his advisers, who are themselves the organs of th=
e majority in=20

Parliament. Old William, Duke of Gloucester, the king's uncle, being rather=
 weak in intellect, was=20

called "Silly Billy." When King William IV. gave his assent to the Reform B=
ill, the Duke, who knew=20

his own nickname, cried "Who's Silly Billy now?" It would have been more di=
fficult from the=20

Conservative point of view to answer that question if the King had possesse=
d the liberty of action=20

which in his Memoir he imagines himself to possess.  The year 1836 opened a=
 new field to the=20

active beneficence of Stockmar. "The approaching majority, and probably not=
 distant accession to=20

the throne, of Princess Victoria of England, engaged the vigilant and far- =
sighted care of her uncle,=20

King Leopold. At the same time he was already making preparations for the e=
ventual execution of=20

a plan, which had long formed the subject of the wishes of the Coburg famil=
y, to wit, the marriage=20

of the future Queen of England with his nephew, Prince Albert of Coburg." S=
tockmar was charged=20

with the duty of=20


_
to see anything beyond living like Doukhobours out here on the edge of Nowh=
ere and=20

remembering that you've got your precious offspring here under your wing an=
d wondering how=20

many bushels of Number-One-Hard it will take to buy your Dinkie a riding pi=
nto!"  "Aren't you=20

rather tired to-night?" I asked with all the patience I could command.  "Ye=
s, and I'm talking about=20

the thing that makes me tired. For you know as well as I do that you've mad=
e that boy of yours a=20

sort of anesthetic. You put him on like a nose-cap, and forget the world. H=
e's about all you=20

remember to think about. Why, when you look at Princess, as her confidentia=
l adviser, at the=20

critical moment of her coming of age, which might also be that of her acces=
sion to the throne.=20

Meanwhile King Leopold consulted with him as to the manner in which Prince =
Albert should make=20

acquaintance with his cousin, and how he "should be prepared for his future=
 vocation." This is=20

pretty broad, and a little lets down the expressions of intense affection f=
or the Queen and=20

unbounded admiration of Prince Albert with which Stockmar overflows. Howeve=
r, a feeling may be=20

genuine though its source is not divine.  Stockmar played his part adroitly=
. He came=20
