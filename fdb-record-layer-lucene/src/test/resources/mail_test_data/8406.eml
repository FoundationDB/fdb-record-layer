philodendron monstera cause for her joy, for her mistress had received a le=

ha, her late housemaid, that she had taken the lost sovereign which had acc=

XXXVIII.  Conclusion.   Franks and his wife received a message from Mr. Cur=
tis, on the following=20

morning, to desire them to come to the vicarage at one. At their accustomed=
 time of assembling=20

for study, the boys of Colme flocked to their school-house, full of expecta=
tion and excitement, the=20

congratulations beaming in their eyes which their lips did not venture to u=
tter; for something in their=20

master's manner told them that they must not speak to him of any change in =
his prospects likely to=20

be caused by the baronet's death. The boys, who were rejoicing in the assur=
ance that they would=20

keep their "dear old Ned Franks," since there free admission of it into the=
 Cellars, would cause as=20

many Alterations in the Liquors, and so would keep them perpetually disturb=
'd and unfit for=20

drinking. I know some curious Gentlemen in these things, that keep double D=
oors to their Cellars,=20

on purpose that none of the outward Air may get into them, and they have go=
od reason to boast of=20

their Malt-Liquors. The meaning of the double Doors, is to keep one shut wh=
ile the other is open,=20

that the outward Air may be excluded; such Cellars, if they lie dry, as the=
y ought to do, are said to=20

be cool in Summer, and warm in Winter, tho' in reality, they are constantly=
 the same in=20


_
there was a new baronet now, could hardly settle to business or attend to t=
heir tasks. Had not their=20

teacher found it quite as difficult to do so himself, he would have had to =
reprove or correct half his=20

pupils for the most ridiculous blunders. There was also an unusual amount o=
f nodding, whispering,=20

and smiling, which Ned Franks for once tried in vain to repress. The boys h=
ad never seemed to=20

care so little for addition or multiplication, or found it so impossible to=
 master a column of spelling.=20

"He'll never leave us, not he;" "Won't the curate be glad to keep him!" "Th=
at fellow with the sly=20

look, who was to have been our master, will have to take himself off sharp,=
 like a beaten dog!"=20

"Won't we have jolly days now, and won't we work double hard at Wild Rose H=
ollow!" Such were=20

the eager whispers which passed from mouth to mouth. It must be owned that =
Franks seemed to=20

be an inefficient school-master on that day, and had very inattentive pupil=
s.  Lesson time was over=20

at last, and punctual to their appointment, the Frankses appeared at the vi=
carage just as the=20

church clock struck one. The boys, instead of dispersing as usual, had foll=
owed them, like an=20

escort, as far as the garden gate. Norah, with a beaming countenance, was w=
aiting Temper: they=20

seem indeed cool in hot Weather, but that is because we come into them from=
 an hotter abroad;=20

and so they seem to us warm in Winter, because we come out of a colder Air =
to them; so that they=20

are only cold or warm comparatively, as the Air we come out of is hotter or=
 colder. This is the=20

Cafe, and a Cellar should be thus dispos'd if we expect to have good Drink.=
 As for the Brewing=20

Part itself, I shall leave that to the Brewers in the several Counties in _=
England_, who have most=20

of them different Manners even of Brewing honestly. What I shall chiefly to=
uch upon, besides what=20

I shall speak of Cellaring, will relate to Water, Malt, Hops, and the keepi=
ng Liquors.  The best=20

Water, to speak in general, is River Water, such as is soft, and has partoo=
k of the Air and Sun; for=20

this easily insinuates itself into the Malt, and extracts its Virtue; where=
as the hard Waters astringe=20

and bind the Parts of the Malt, so that its Virtue is not freely communicat=
ed to the Liquor. It is a=20

Rule with a Friend of mine, that all Water which will mix with Soap is fit =
for Brewing, and he will by=20

no means allow of any other; and I have more than once experienc'd, that wh=
ere the same=20

Quantity of Malt has been used to a Barrel of River Water, and the=20
