The logs were fastened together so insecurely, owing to the fact that all t=

mpadre,=E2=80=9D told all his wondrous tale, and how they finished off _
morning; but when morning came, the boat was gone. She had broken loose dur=
ing the night, not=20

having been properly fastened, and had floated quietly away. A faint speck =
was visible on the=20

surface of the lake about two miles away, which Harry, who had remarkably g=
ood eyes, said was=20

the _Whitewing_. Whether he was right or wrong, it was quite certain that t=
he boys were=20

imprisoned on the island, with nothing to eat but a can of peaches and some=
 coffee and sugar.=20

The fish, however, were waiting to be caught, and before very long a breakf=
ast of fish and of=20

coffee without milk was ready. The boys then began to discuss the important=
 question of how they=20

were to get back their boat, or to get away from the island.  It was a mile=
 to the shore, and nobody=20

felt able to swim that distance. Joe proposed that they fasten one of their=
 shirts to a tall tree, as a=20

signal of distress, and then fire the gun every minute. The objection to th=
is plan was that the=20

nearest house was out of sight behind a little point of land, and that no o=
ne would see the signal,=20

or would understand why the gun was fired. Then Tom proposed to build a raf=
t, on which two boys=20

could paddle after the runaway boat. This was a practicable suggestion, and=
 it was at once put=20

into execution.  It was hard work to cut down timber enough to build a raft=
, but by perseverance=20

the raft was finished before noon. It consisted of four logs laid side by s=
ide, and bound together=20

with handkerchiefs, shoe-strings, green twigs, and a few strips from one of=
 Harry's shirts, which he=20

said was unnecessarily long. It was covered with two or three pieces of fla=
t drift-wood; and when it=20

was finished, a piece of board was found, which was shaped with the hatchet=
 into a rude paddle.=20

Then Tom and Harry proceeded to embark.  [Illustration: HARRY SETS OUT IN P=
URSUIT OF=20

THE BOAT.]  The raft floated Harry very well, but countries such as those i=
n whose vast plains the=20

pulperia stands for club, exchange, for meeting-place, and represents all t=
hat in other lands men=20

think they find in Paris or in London, and choose to dignify under the styl=
e of intellectual life.  Be it=20

far from me to think that we have bettered the Creator=E2=80=99s scheme; or=
 by the substitution of our=20

polyandry for polygamy, bettered the position of women, or in fact done any=
thing but changed and=20

made more complex that which at first was clear to understand.  But, be tha=
t as it may and without=20

dogmatism, our love, our vices, our rendering wicked things natural in them=
selves, our secrecy,=20

our pruriency, adultery, and all the myriad ramifications of things sexual,=
 without which no novelist=20

could earn his bread, fall into nothing, except there is a press-directed p=
ublic opinion, laws, bye-

laws, leaded type and headlines, so to speak, to keep them up.  True, nothi=
ng of all this entered=20

our heads as we sat drinking, listening to a contest of minstrelsy =E2=80=
=9Cpor contrapunto=E2=80=9D betwixt a=20

Gaucho payador and a =E2=80=9Cmatrero negro=E2=80=9D of great fame, who eac=

=E2=80=9Cchangango=E2=80=9D in their lazo-hardened hands, plucked at its st=
rings in such a style as to well illustrate=20

the saying that to play on the guitar is not a thing of science, but requir=
es but perseverance, hard=20

finger-tips, and an unusual development of strength in the right wrist.  Ne=
gro and payador each=20

sang alternately; firstly old Spanish love songs handed down from before th=

stepped on it. Either more timber must be added to it, or one boy must go a=
lone in search of the=20

boat. Harry insisted upon going at once, and as the lake was perfectly smoo=
th, and he could swim=20

well, there did not seem to be great risk in his making the voyage fitting =
