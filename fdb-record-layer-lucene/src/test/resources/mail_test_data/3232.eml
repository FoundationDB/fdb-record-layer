only the conviction of its     powerlessness to see itself otherwise than as successive and 

transitory.   This all refers to Spirit embodied, not to the freed Spiritual Self on whom Maya has no

suppression, "ah! I have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds; I have assuaged 

the natural ferocity of those who shed blood; on every occasion I have exposed my life to save 

those who were in danger, and I have preserved

Orientalists made of it "nobody" and nothing. Hence they proclaim Buddhists to be Nihilists, and 

Vedantins to be the followers of a creed in which the "Impersonal [God] turns out on examination 

to be a myth"; their goal is described as       The complete away. That is not all; the money gained

execution pursues me constantly and every night I see that woman's ghost rising before me."  "A 

woman! You have assassinated a woman, then?" cried the monk.  "You also!" exclaimed the 

executioner, "you use that word which sounds ever in my ears--'assassinated!' I have 

assassinated, then, and not executed! I am an assassin, then, and not an officer of justice!" and 

he closed his eyes with a groan.  The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying 

more, for he exclaimed eagerly:  "Go on, I know nothing, as yet; when you have finished your 

story, God and I will judge."  "Oh, father," continued the executioner, without opening his eyes, as 

if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object, "it is
