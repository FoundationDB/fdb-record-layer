philodendron monstera was an accumulation of business to go through. In the=

afternoon--or to sundry trifling causes which he at Combwich, ten or what w=

er one shoulder, one of the braves looked round on the warrior band with a =
dark scowl before he began.  His comrades were evidently impressed by his _
grave smile of hers into his eager young face. "I could not let him travel =
alone ... could I?"  "No,=20

no," he assented somewhat dubiously, "but remember, dear heart, that you ar=
e infinitely precious=20

and that I shall scarce live for sheer anxiety until I have you here, safe,=
 once more in my arms."=20

"I'll send you a courier this evening," she rejoined, as she extricated her=
self gently from his=20

embrace, "and if I can come back to-morrow...."  "I'll ride over to Bath in=
 any case in the morning=20

so that I may escort you back if you really can come."  "I will come if I a=
m reassured about father.=20

Oh, my dear lord," she added with a wistful little sigh, "I knew yesterday =
morning that I their only=20

fear was a surprise.  The half-breeds being far more numerous than the Indi=
ans, and well=20

entrenched, there could be no fear for them if prepared.  Just then, as if =
to favour them, the moon=20

retired behind a huge black cloud.  Without a moment's hesitation Dan began=
 to creep away back,=20

closely followed by Fergus.  They gave a wide berth of course to the sentin=
el, and soon regained=20

the hollow where the horses had been left.  Here they breathed more freely.=
  "Who would have=20

thought this of Okematan?" muttered Dan, as he hastily tightened his saddle=
-girths.  "The=20

_rascal_!" exclaimed Fergus, in deep tones of indignation.  "You must gallo=

hese last few days."=20

"You are not seriously anxious about M. le duc's health, dear heart?"  "No,=
 not seriously anxious.=20

Farewell, milor. It is _au revoir_ ... a few hours and we'll resume our dre=
am."   V  There was=20

nothing in all that to arouse my lord Tony's suspicions. All day he was mis=
erable and forlorn=20

because Yvonne was not there--but he was not suspicious.  Fate had a blow i=
n store for him, from=20

which he was destined never wholly to recover, but she gave him no warning,=
 no premonition. He=20

spent the day in making up arrears of correspondence, for he had a large pr=
ivate fortune to=20

administer--trust funds on behalf of brothers and sisters who were minors--=
and he always did it=20

conscientiously and to the best of his ability. The last few days he had mo=
unted.  "I will go on to=20

Red River alone."  "What! will you not be coming with me?" asked the Highla=
nder, in some=20

surprise.  "There is no need, for there will be no fighting," returned the =
other. "Our fellows far=20

outnumber the Red-skins, and when the latter find that we have been warned,=
 and are on our=20

guard, they won't attack us, depend on it.  But you'll have to ride fast, f=
or when such fellows make=20

up their minds to strike they don't usually waste time in delivering the bl=

I _must_ go on."  A minute later, and Dan Davidson was galloping towards th=
e Settlement alone,=20

while Fergus made the best of his way back to the camp of the buffalo runne=
