ntime Fox, intrusted with the=20

general charge of the relief expedition, was sent by the President, March 3=
0th, to New York, with=20

verbal instructions to prepare for the voyage but to make no binding engage=
ments. Not having=20

received the written authority expected, he returned to Washington April 2d=
, and on the 4th the=20

final decision was reached, and Fox was informed that a messenger would be =
sent to the=20

authorities at Charleston to notify them of the President=E2=80=99s action.=
 Fox mentioned to the President=20

that he would have but nine days to charter vessels and reach Charleston, s=
ix hundred and thirty-

two miles distant. He arrived at New York April 5th, bearing an order from =
General Scott to=20

Lieutenant-Colonel H.=C2=A0L. Scott (son-in-law and aide-de-camp to the gen=
eral-in-chief), embracing=20

all his wants and directing Colonel Scott to give in his name all necessary=
 instructions. Colonel=20

Scott ridiculed the idea of relief, and his indifference caused the loss of=
 half a day of precious time,=20

besides furnishing recruits who, Fox complained, were =E2=80=9Ctotally unfi=
t=E2=80=9D for the service they were sent=20

on.[198]  Fox at once engaged the large steamer _Baltic_ for troops and sto=
res, and, after great=20

difficulty, obtained three tugs, the _Uncle Ben_, _Freeborn_, and _Yankee_,=
 the last fitted to throw=20

hot water. The _Pocahontas_, _Pawnee_, and the revenue-cutter _Harriet Lane=
_, as already=20

mentioned, were to be a part of the force, which thus, with the _Powhatan_,=
 included four armed=20

vessels, the last being of considerable power. The _Pawnee_, Commander Rowa=
n, sailed from=20

Washington the 9th; the _Pocahontas_, Captain Gillis, from Norfolk the 10th=
; the _Harriet Lane_,=20



Captain Faunce, from New York the 8th; the _Baltic_, Captain Fletcher, the =
9th. The _Powhatan_=20

was already far on her way to Pensacola.  The _Baltic_ arrived at the rende=
zvous, ten miles east=20

of Charleston bar, at 3 A.M. of the 12th, and found there the _Harriet Lane=
_; at six the _Pawnee_=20

arrived; the _Powhatan_ was not visible. The _Baltic_, followed by the _Har=
riet Lane_, stood in=20

toward the land, where heavy guns were heard and the smoke and shells from =

 went aboard the=20

_Pawnee_ and informed him that he would answer for it that the government d=
