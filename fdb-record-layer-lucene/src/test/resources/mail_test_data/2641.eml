dracaena marginata flight, and the swift pursuit, the vain shrieks to man a=
nd God for succour, and the utter annihilation of the foe:--    (42) "And I=
 will pound them like dust before the wind,         Like street-filth will =
I empty them out."  Then he gives utterance to the consciousness that his k=
ingdom is destined to extend far beyond the limits of Israel, in words whic=
h, like so many of the prophecies, may be translated in the present tense, =
but and try it;" and I was moving off when Ursula seized my hand, and almos=
t dragged me back to her mother's side. She lifted up her eyes like one ins=
pired, and the radiancy of her expression seemed to dazzle and blind me. Th=
en she knelt down, and I knelt by her side, while her mother lay before us,=
 her whole frame heaving with convulsive sobs, and Broadhem stood by wonder=
ing and awestruck. I can't repeat that prayer here, but there was dracaena =
marginata flight, and the swift pursuit, the vain shrieks to man and God fo=
r succour, and the utter annihilation of the foe:--    (42) "And I will pou=
nd them like dust before the wind,         Like street-filth will I empty t=
hem out."  Then he gives utterance to the consciousness that his kingdom is=
 destined to extend far beyond the limits of Israel, in words which, like s=
o many of the prophecies, may be translated in the present tense, but and t=
ry it;" and I was moving off when Ursula seized my hand, and almost dragged=
 me back to her mother's side. She lifted up her eyes like one inspired, an=
d the radiancy of her expression seemed to dazzle and blind me. Then she kn=
elt down, and I knelt by her side, while her mother lay before us, her whol=
e frame heaving with convulsive sobs, and Broadhem stood by wondering and a=
westruck. I can't repeat that prayer here, but there was _
variety of opinion prevails on the matter among commentators. It is perhaps=
 best to follow many of=20

the older versions, and the valuable exposition of Hupfeld, in regarding th=
e whole section from ver.=20

37 of our translation as the expression of the trust which past experience =
had wrought. We shall=20

then have two periods in the desert, and coming on water. Yes, there they a=
re welling out, honest=20

large drops, chasing each other to the point of her nose. Oh, my dear Lady =
Broadhem, I am=20

beginning to love you, and my eyes are beginning to swim too; and before sh=
e knew where she=20

was, I threw my arms round her neck and kissed her--an example which was=20


_
psalm--the past victories won by God's help (vers. 31-36), the coming trium=
phs of which these are=20

the pledge (vers. 37-end).  In the former there shine out not only David's =
habitual consciousness=20

of dependence on and aid from God, but also a very striking picture of his =
physical qualifications=20

for a military leader. He is girded with bodily strength, swift and sure of=
 foot like a deer, able to=20

scale the crags where his foes fortified themselves like the wild antelopes=
 he had so often seen=20

bounding among the dizzy ledges of the cliffs in the wilderness; his hands =
are trained for war, and=20

his sinewy arms can bend the great bow of brass. But these capacities are g=
ifts, and not they, but=20

their Giver, have made him victorious. Looking back upon all his past, this=
 is its summing up:--=20

"Thou hast also given me the shield of Thy salvation,    And Thy right hand=
 hath holden me up,=20

And Thy lowliness hath made me great."  God's strength, God's buckler, God'=
s supporting hand,=20

God's condescension, by which He bows down to look upon and help the feeble=
, with the humble=20

showing Himself Ursula and Broadhem, and which so overcame their mother tha=
t she buried her=20

face in a pillow and sobbed out--in tears that might at first have been bit=
ter, but were assuredly=20

sweet and refreshing at last--her repentance. I don't think Broadhem had an=
y very definite idea=20

why he wept, beyond a feeling of sympathy with his mother, and the fact, wh=
ich I afterwards=20

heard, that Wild Harrie had taken Spiffy's advice, and refused him; so he m=
ingled his tears with=20

hers, but Lady Ursula's eyes were dry and supernaturally brilliant. As I ga=
zed on the group, my=20

own heart seemed to swell to bursting. I do really believe and trust that L=
ady Broadhem will give=20

up the worldly-holies, and become a pious good woman; and that those talent=
s and that force of=20

character which she possesses may be dedicated to a higher service than the=
y have heretofore=20

been. If I have been the humble instrument of working the change, the soone=
r I send Grandon=20

here and vanish myself from the scene, the better, or I shall become vain a=
nd conceited, I thought;=20

and I rose from my seat.  "Good-bye, Lady Broadhem," I said, "you=20


_
from these has come his victory.  And because of these, he looks forward to=
 a future like the past,=20

but more glorious still, thereby teaching us how the unchanging faithfulnes=
s of our God should=20

encourage us to take all the blessings which we have received as but the ea=
rnest of what is yet to=20

come. He sees himself pursuing his enemies, and smiting them to the ground.=
 The fierce light of=20

battle blazes going to America in three days, and must go to Flityville to-=
morrow; but I never=20

thought I could have bid you all farewell and felt so happy at the prospect=
 of parting;" and I threw=20

one yearning glance on Ursula in spite of myself. "Your happiness is secure=
d, I do most firmly=20

believe," I said to her; "and as for you," and I laid my hand on Broadhem's=
 shoulder, "remember=20

the experiment I proposed to you the=20
