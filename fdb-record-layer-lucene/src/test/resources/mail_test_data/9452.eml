BECAUSE PATRICIA SAID "NO"   Some one was giving a dinner dance at the coun=
try club, and=20

Blount, who was a week-end guest of the Beverleys, was ill-natured enough t=
o be resentful. What=20

right had a gay and frivolous world to come and thrust its light-hearted ha=
ppiness upon him when=20

Patricia had said "No"? It was like bullying a cripple, he told himself mor=
osely, and when he had=20

read the single telegram which had come while he was at dinner he begged Mr=
s. Beverley's=20

indulgence and went out to find a chair in a corner of the veranda where th=
e frivolities had not as=20

yet intruded.  It was a North Shore night like that in which Shakespeare ha=
s mingled moon-

shadows with the gossamer fantasies of the immortal "Dream." Though the dan=
ce was in-doors,=20

the trees on the lawn and the road-fronting verandas of the club-house were=
 hung with festoons of=20

Chinese lanterns. At the carriage-entrance smart automobiles were coming an=
d going, and one of=20

them, with the dust of the Boston parkways on its running-gear, brought the=
 guests of honor--three=20

daughters of a Western senator lately home from their summer abroad.  Bloun=
t knew neither the=20

honorers nor the honored ones, and had resolutely refused the chance offere=
d him by Mrs.=20

Beverley to amend his ignorance. For Patricia's "No" was not yet twenty-fou=
r hours old, and since=20

it had changed the stars in their courses for Patricia's lover, the catacly=
sm was much too recent to=20



postulate anything like a return of the heavenly bodies to their normal orb=
its.  Not that Blount put it=20

that way, either to Mrs. Beverley or to himself. He was a level-eyed, squar=
e-shouldered young=20

man of an up-to-date world, and the stock from which he sprang was prosaic =
and practical rather=20

than poetic or sentimental. But the fact remained, and when he sat back in =
his corner absently=20

folding the lately received telegram into a narrow spill and scowling moodi=
ly down upon the=20

coming and going procession of motor-cars he was unconsciously giving a ver=
y life-like imitation of=20

the disappointed lover the world over.  It was thus, and apparently by the =
merest chance, that=20

Gantry found him; a chance because the Winnebasset club-house is spacious a=
nd the dinner=20

dance minimized the hazards of a meeting between two unattached men who wer=
e merely=20

transient guests. But the railroad man at least was unfeignedly glad.  "Doe=
sn't it beat the dickens=20

what a little world this is?" he exclaimed, with a true bromidian disregard=
 for the outworn and the=20

axiomatic. "Of course, I knew you were in or around Boston somewhere, but t=
o run slap up against=20

you here, when there seemed to be nothing in it for me but to be bored stif=
f--" He stopped short,=20

finding it difficult to be shiftily insincere with as old a friend as Evan =
Blount. But in the nature of=20

things it was baldly impossible to tell Blount that the meeting was not acc=
idental.  "Pull up a chair=20

and sit down," said Blount, not too ungraciously, considering his just caus=
e to be more ungracious.=20

"I was thinking of you a little while ago, Dick. I saw your name in the lis=
t of Transcontinental=20

representatives to the traffic meeting in Boston, and--well, at the present=
 moment I'm not sure but=20

you are the one man in the world I wanted most to meet."  "Say! that sounds=
 pretty good to me,"=20

laughed Gantry, settling himself comfortably in a lazy-chair and feeling in=
 his pockets for a cigar.=20

"I've been in Boston the full week, skating around over the chilly crust of=
 things and never able to=20

get so much as one tenuous little social claw-hold. Say, Evan, how many ice=
-plants does that=20

impenetrable old town keep going ever count 'em?"  "Boston is all right whe=
n you know it--or,=20

rather, when it comes to know you," returned Blount, remembering that Bosto=
n or Cambridge--

which is Boston in the process of elucidation--was the birth and dwelling p=
lace of Patricia.  Gantry=20

grinned broadly and lighted his cigar.  "The 'effete East' has psychically =
and psychologically=20

corralled you, hasn't it, Evan?--to put it in choice Bostonese. I thought m=
aybe it would when I=20

heard you were taking the post-graduate frills in the Harvard Law School. B=
y the way, how much=20

longer are you in for?"  "I am out of the Law School, if that is what you m=
ean--out and admitted to=20

the bar," said Blount. "If you get into trouble with the Boston police let =
me know, and I'll ask for a=20

change of venue to the greasewood hills and Judge Lynch's court."  "The goo=
d old greasewood=20

hills!" chanted Gantry, who was of those who curse their homeland to its fa=
ce and praise it=20

consistently and pugnaciously elsewhere. "Are you ever coming back to them,=
 Blount? I believe=20

you told me once, in the old college days, that you were Western-born."  "I=
 told you the truth; and=20

until to-night I have never thought much about going back," was Blount's ra=
ther enigmatic reply.=20

"But now you are thinking of it?" inquired the railroad man, waking up. "Th=
at's good; the old Sage-

brush State is needing a few bright young lawyers mighty bad. Is that why I=
'm the particular fellow=20

you wanted to meet?"  Blount passed the telegram which had come while he wa=
s at dinner across=20

the interval between the two chairs. "Read that," he said.  Gantry smoothed=
 the square of yellow=20

paper carefully and held it up to the softened glow of the electric ceiling=
-globe. Its date-line carried=20

the name of his own city in the "greasewood country"--the capital of the St=
ate--and the time-

markings sufficiently indicated its recent arrival. Below the date-line he =
read:  TO EVAN SHELBY=20



BLOUNT, Standish Apartments, Boston.       You have had everything that mon=
ey could buy, and=20

you owe me      nothing but an occasional sight of your face. If you are no=
t tied      to some=20

woman's apron-string, why can't you come West and grow up      with your na=
tive State?  DAVID=20

BLOUNT.  It was characteristic of Richard Gantry, light-handed juggler of f=
riendly phrases, but=20

none the less a careful and methodical official of a great railway company,=
 that he folded the=20

telegram in the original creases before he passed it back.  "Well?" said Bl=
ount, when the pause=20

had grown over-abundantly long.  "I was just thinking," was the reflective =
rejoinder. "We used to be=20

fairly chummy in the old Ann Arbor days, Evan, and yet I never, until a few=
 days ago, knew or=20

guessed that Senator Blount was your father."  "He was and is," was the qui=
et reply. "I supposed=20

everybody knew it."  "_I_ didn't," Gantry denied, adding: "You may not real=
ize it, but what you don't=20

tell people about yourself would make a pretty big book if it were printed.=
"  Blount's smile was=20

altogether friendly.  "What's the use, Richard?" he asked. "The world has p=
lenty of banalities and=20

commonplaces without the adding of any man's personal contribution. Why sho=
uld I bore you or=20

anybody?"  "Oh, of course, if you put it on that ground," said the railroad=
 traffic manager. "Just the=20

same, there's another side to it. In an unguarded moment, back in the colle=
ge days, as I smashed=20

a big hole in her port bow."  "As I would in one of the bows of the pirate.=
"  "But there was a reason=20

for it; I was a prisoner on board of that Maud, or Viking--captured as this=
 pirate would serve me if=20

he got a chance."  "I would sink him before he got the chance, rather than =
after he had picked you=20

up," persisted the captain.  "I doubt if that would be a prudent measure," =
replied Louis, shaking his=20

head.  "The pirate has changed her course to the southward," said Felix, co=
ming to the window of=20

the pilot-house again.  "What does that mean?" demanded the captain.  "It m=
eans that she is=20

going to make a port at Rosetta."  "She is about off the Rosetta mouth of t=
he Nile; but she is doing=20

that only to shake off the Guardian-Mother. What is the ship doing, Flix?" =
 "She continues on her=20

course, and takes no notice of the pirate;" and the lookout returned to his=
 station.  Captain Scott=20

rang the gong in the engine-room, and the screw of the Maud immediately cea=
sed to revolve. The=20

sea was comparatively smooth, and the little steamer rolled on the waves bu=
t slightly. As soon as=20

the screw stopped, and the little craft began to roll on the long swell, Mo=
rris Woolridge put aside=20

the "Chambers's" in which he had been reading up Assyria and Babylon, and w=
ent out of the cabin=20

into the standing-room. He looked about him to ascertain the cause of the s=
toppage; but he could=20

make nothing of it.  He was a good skipper himself, and he did not like to =
ask Captain Scott to=20

explain the situation; for since he had gone into the cabin the relative po=
sitions of the three=20

steamers had decidedly changed. His idea was that the Maud should follow th=
e ship as usual; but=20

she had dropped at least a couple of miles astern of her, and the Fatime wa=
s headed to the=20

southward. He could not understand the matter at all, and he continued to s=
tudy upon it.  Louis=20

had come out of the pilot-house, and, looking aft, he discovered Morris, an=
d saw that he was=20

perplexed by the situation, and that Assyria was no longer the subject of h=
is meditations.  "Morris=20

is in the standing-room, and I have no doubt he is wondering why we are was=
ting our steam just=20

here, when the ship is going ahead at full speed," said he to the captain. =
"Don't you think the time=20

has come?"  "No doubt of it," answered the captain.  These last remarks may=
 seem a little=20

mysterious; but the present situation had been foreseen by Captain Ringgold=
. Morris was the first=20

officer, and if the momentous secret was to be kept from him any longer, it=
 would require an=20

amount of lying and deception which was utterly repugnant to the principles=
 of both the=20



commander and Louis. The representative of the Woolridge family on board of=
 the Maud must be=20

left with his father and mother and sister on the ship, or the whole truth =
must be told to the son.=20

Thus far no lies had been necessary; and the captain did not believe it wou=
ld be wrong for him to=20

conceal what would be dangerous to the peace of mind of his passengers.  As=
 long as Captain=20

Ringgold conscientiously believed that neither Miss Blanche nor Louis was i=
n any peril, he=20

considered it his duty to conceal from their parents the plot of the Pacha =
and his agents. He was=20

sure that neither Mrs. Woolridge nor Mrs. Belgrave would consent to continu=
e the voyage even in=20

the face of a very remote danger to their children. He had abundant resourc=
es on board, including=20

his two twelve-pounders, for their protection; and he had used them on one =
occasion, though his=20

passengers did not understand the reason of the attack made on the Maud.  T=
his subject had=20

been considered before the vessels sailed from Alexandria, and the commande=
r declared that he=20

could not adopt the scheme of Scott, if they were to be required to utter n=
o end of falsehoods to=20

Morris; and Louis absolutely refused to do so. They had finally compromised=
 by making the owner=20

a committee of one to confer with the subject of the difficulty when the ti=
me for action came. Like=20

the others, Morris was to be pledged to secrecy for the peace and comfort o=
f the mothers. If he=20

refused to give the pledge, the plan of Captain Scott was to be abandoned, =
and the Maud was to=20

place herself immediately under the wing of the Guardian-Mother again. The =
time for action on this=20

subject had come.  "I will go aft and have a talk with Morris; and I am onl=
y afraid he will fly off at=20

the want of confidence in him we have shown," said Louis.  "But his case is=
 not a whit different=20

from your own; for you have a mother in the cabin as well as he," added the=
 captain.  "But we=20

have concealed everything from him for months; but Morris is as good a fell=
ow as ever sailed the=20

seas, and he will be reasonable."  "I pledged myself to secrecy, and I thin=
k we had better make the=20

'Big Four' a society for the protection of this secret till the end of the =
voyage."  "We will consider=20

that at another time," replied Louis as he moved aft.  He found Morris stil=
l looking about in order to=20

solve what was a mystery to him, as it must have been to the engineers and =
the cook; but they=20

were paid employes, and it was not proper for them to ask any questions.  "=
Anything broken down,=20

Louis?" asked Morris, as his watch-mate took a seat at his side.  "Nothing =
at all," replied the=20

owner. "Do you believe, Morris, that you could keep a very important secret=
 if the peace and=20

happiness of your best friends on earth depended upon it?"  "I know I could=
, even from my mother,=20

from whom I never kept a secret except once, when I heard the doctor say so=
mething about the=20

health of Blanche last winter, not long before we sailed in the yacht. I kn=
ew that it would worry the=20

life out of her," replied Morris very seriously.  "This is a case just like=
 that; and if the secret came=20

out it would worry the life out of your mother and mine, and perhaps seriou=
sly affect the health of=20

Miss Blanche."  "There is my hand, and I will pledge myself to any honest s=
ecret you may impart=20

to me; for I know you would not lead me to do anything wrong."  "I would ju=
mp overboard before I=20

would lead you astray, Morris," protested Louis as he took the offered hand=
, and the pledge was=20

exchanged.  It required two hours to tell the whole story of the operations=
 of Captain Mazagan,=20

begun at Constantinople four months before, including the discovery of the =
plot of the conspirators=20

in the cafe at Gallipoli.  Morris was astonished at the explanation given h=
im of several incidents=20

with which he was familiar. He quite agreed with Louis as to the necessity =
of keeping the secret;=20

for his mother would worry herself into a fit of sickness if she learned th=
e truth. He agreed that=20

there was no alternative between abandoning the excursion, which would be a=
 great grief to him,=20



and confining the secret to those who now knew it; and he repeated his pled=
ge with more=20

earnestness than before.     CHAPTER IV  THE POSITION OF THE THREE STEAMERS=
   The=20

conference in the standing-room of the Maud ended, and all the "Big Four" w=
ere in possession of=20

the secret upon the keeping of which the continuation of the delightful exc=
ursion voyage=20

depended. They stood on a perfect equality now, and each was as wise as the=
 others. When Louis=20

went forward, Morris went with him; and after the result of the interview h=
ad been announced,=20

Scott grasped the hand of the newly initiated, and Felix followed his examp=
le.  "I can see that you=20

are all glad to keep me no longer in the dark," said Morris. "You must have=
 been walking on glass=20

all the time for fear that I should break through, and upset your plan to k=
eep me behind the=20

curtain."  "That is so," replied the captain. "We had to shut up tight whil=
e you were in the pilot-

house; and as Louis is in your watch, I stopped the Maud partly to give him=
 a chance to talk with=20

you, and partly to carry out the manoeuvre agreed upon."  "But I can't see =
why it was considered=20

necessary to keep me in the dark," added Morris. "Am I supposed to be any m=
ore leaky than the=20

rest of you?"  "I don't believe any one thought so," replied Louis. "You re=
member that at Gallipoli,=20

Flix and I went ashore in one of the two harbors, taking Don with us to tal=
k Turkish, though His=20

Highness and Captain Mazagan did their business in French, which they suppo=
sed no one near=20

them could speak or understand; and I happened to be the only one of our pa=
rty who took in all=20

that was said. When we returned to the Guardian-Mother I told Captain Ringg=
old all about it, in the=20

presence of Flix. The commander immediately directed us to say not a word a=
bout it to any=20

person. Even Captain Scott was kept in the dark till he and I were on the v=
erge of a quarrel in=20

Pournea Bay."  "That is putting it a little too strong, Louis," interposed =
the captain. "I should not=20

have quarrelled with you under any circumstances; I could not have done so.=
"  "But I interfered=20

with you in your command because I understood the situation, and you did no=
t; and Captain=20

Ringgold told me to tell you all there was to be told," Louis explained. "B=
ut he was not willing you=20

should be posted, Morris; for he feared that you might unintentionally betr=
ay the secret to your=20

mother. We have got along so far without lying, and I believe the commander=
 would throw up the=20

voyage rather than have any of us go beyond simple concealment without fals=
ehood. As he says,=20

we are acting a lie, though we are doing it for the health, comfort, and ha=
ppiness of those we love=20

the best on earth. The biggest lies are sometimes told without the utteranc=
e of a vocal word."  "I=20

am satisfied, fellows, and I am=20


_
that you were Western-born. I always supposed afterward that you regretted =
either the fact or the=20

mention of it, since you never told me any more."  "Perhaps I didn't tell m=
ore because there was=20

so little to tell. I had a boyhood like other boys--or, no, possibly it was=
n't quite the usual. I was born=20

on the 'Circle-Bar,' when the ranch was--as it still is, I believe--a hard =
day's drive for a bunch of=20

prime steers distant from the nearest shipping-corral on the railroad. At t=
welve I could 'ride line,'=20

'cut out,' and 'rope down' like any other healthy ranch-bred youngster, and=
 since the capital was at=20

that time only in process of getting itself surveyed and boomed into existe=
nce I had never seen a=20

town bigger than Painted Hat."  "And what happened when you were twelve?" q=
ueried Gantry. He=20

was not abnormally curious, but Blount's communicative mood was unusual eno=
ugh to warrant a=20

quickening of interest.  "The greatest possible misfortune that can ever co=
me to a half-grown boy,=20

Dick--my mother died."  Gantry's own boyhood was not so deeply buried in th=
e past as to make=20

him forgetful of its joys and sorrows. "That was hard--mighty hard," he ass=
ented. Then: "And pretty=20

soon your father married again?"  "Not for some years," Blount qualified. "=
But for me the heavens=20

were fallen. I was sent away to school, to college, to Europe; then I came =
here to the Law School.=20

In all that time I've never seen the 'Circle-Bar' or my native State--in fa=
ct, I have never been west=20

of Chicago."  Gantry was astonished and he admitted it in exclamatory phras=
e. As a railroad man,=20

continent-crossing travel was to him the merest matter of course. Though he=
 might Sunday-over at=20

the Winnebasset Country Club on the North Shore, it was well within the pos=
sibilities that the=20

following week-end might find him sweltering in New Orleans or buttoning hi=
s overcoat against the=20

raw evening fogs of San Francisco.  "Never been west of Chicago?" he echoed=
. "Never been--"=20

He stopped short, beginning to realize vaguely that there must be strong re=
asons; reasons which=20

might lie beyond the pale of a college friendship, and the confidences bego=
tten thereby, in the=20

rendering of them.  "No," said Blount.  "Then the senator's--that is--er--y=
our father's political life=20

has never touched you."  The friendly smile rippled again at the corners of=
 Blount's steady gray=20

eyes, but this time it was shot through with a faint suggestion of the Blou=
nt grimness.  "It has=20

touched me on the sympathetic side, Dick. I saw a large-hearted, open-hande=
d old cattle-king=20

wading good-naturedly into the muddy stream of politics to gratify an ambit=
ion that wasn't at all his=20

own--a woman's ambition. In order that the woman might mix and mingle in Wa=
shington society=20

for a brief minute or two, he got himself elected to fill out an unexpired =
term of two months in the=20

United States Senate--bought the election, some said. That was three years =
ago, wasn't it?--a=20

long time, as political incidents or accidents go. But Washington hasn't fo=
rgotten. When I was=20

down there last winter the five-o'clock-tea people were still recalling Mrs=
. Blount's gowns and the=20

wild-Western naivete of 'The Honorable Senator Sage-Brush.'"  Gantry was ch=
uckling softly when=20

the half-bitter admission had got itself fully made.  "Land of love, Evan!"=
 he said, "you may be an=20

educated post-graduate all right, with the proper Boston degree of culture =
laid on and rubbed=20

down to a hard-glaze finish, but you've got a lot to learn yet--about the s=
enator and his politics, I=20

mean. Why, Great Snipes, man! he isn't in it a little bit for the social fr=
ills and furbelows; he never=20

was. Let me intimate a few things: Politically speaking, David Blount is by=
 long odds the biggest=20

man in his State to-day. He can have anything he wants, from the head of th=
e ticket down. You=20

spoke rather contemptuously just now of his two months in the Senate; you p=
robably didn't know=20

that he might have gone back if he had wanted to; that he actually did a mu=
ch more difficult thing--

named his successor."  David Blount's son stood up and put his shoulders ag=
ainst one of the=20



veranda pillars. From the new view-point he could look through the reading-=
room windows and on=20

into the assembly-room where the dancers were keeping time to the measures =
of a two-step. But=20

he was not thinking of the dancers when he said:  "It's a sheer miracle, Di=
ck, your dropping down=20

here to-night like the _deus ex machina_ of the old Greek plays. You've rea=
d this telegram"--

holding up the folded message--"it is just possible that you can tell me wh=
at lies behind it. Why has=20

my father sent it at this particular time and in those words? He knows perf=
ectly well that my plans=20

for settling here in Boston were definitely made more than a year ago."  "I=
 can tell you the situation=20

out in the greasewood country, if that's what you want to know," said Gantr=
y after a thoughtful=20

pause.  "Make it simple," was Blount's condition, adding: "What I don't kno=
w about the business or=20

the political situation in the West would fill a much larger book than the =
one you were speaking of=20

a few minutes ago."  "'Business or political,' you say; they are Siamese tw=
ins nowadays," returned=20

the railroad man, with a short laugh. Then: "The outlook for us out yonder =
in the greasewood hills=20

is precisely what it is in a dozen other States this year--east, west, nort=
h and south--everything=20

promising a renewal of the unreasoning, bull-headed legislative fight again=
st the railroads. I=20

suppose our own case is typical. As everybody knows, the Transcontinental R=
ailway has=20

practically created two-thirds of the States through which it passes--made =
them out of whole cloth.=20

Where you left sage-brush and bare hills and unfenced cattle ranges a dozen=
 years ago you will=20

now find irrigation, tilled farms, orchards, rich mines--development everyw=
here, with a rapidly=20

growing population to help it along. To make all this possible, the railroa=
d took a chance; it was a=20

mighty long chance, and somebody has to pay the bills."  "I know," smiled B=
lount; "the bill-paying=20

is summed up in some railroad man's clever phrase, 'all the tariff the traf=
fic will stand.' I can=20

remember one year when my father rose up in his wrath and drove his beef ca=
ttle one hundred=20

and fifty miles across the Transcontinental tracks to the Overland Central.=
"  "That was in the old=20

days," protested Gantry, who was loyal to his salt. "As the State has fille=
d up, we've tried to meet=20

the situation half-way, as a straight business proposition. Fares and tarif=
fs have been lowered from=20

time to time, and--"  "You are not making it simple enough by half," warned=
 Blount quizzically.=20

"You are getting further away from my telegram every minute."  Gantry pause=
d to relight his cigar.=20

"I don't know how your telegram figures in it specially, but I do know this=
: the legislature to be=20

elected this fall in our State will be chosen entirely without regard to th=
e old party lines. There is=20

only one issue before the people and that is the Transcontinental Railway. =
The 'Paramounters,' as=20

they call themselves, taking the name from the assumption that it is the pa=
ramount duty of the=20

voter to pinch any business interest bigger than his own, would like to leg=
islate us out of existence;=20

as against that we shall beat the tomtom and do our level best to stay on t=
op of earth."  "Naturally,"=20

Blount agreed, then half-absently, and with his eyes still resting upon the=
 merrymakers twirling like=20

paired the highest of motives. Now I should like to know something about th=
e manoeuvre in which=20

you are engaged."  Captain Scott explained it in full. Felix had gone to hi=
s station in the bow, to=20

observe the movements of the Guardian-Mother and the Fatime. From there he =
had gone to the=20

hurricane deck, in order to obtain a better view. After an absence of half =
an hour he came into the=20

pilot-house again, with his glass under his arm; for it had now become the =
emblem of his=20

occupation.  "The ship is so far off that I can't tell whether or not she i=
s still rushing things; but I=20

judge by her distance that the engine is making things lively in the fire-r=
oom," said he.  "How about=20

the Fatime?" asked the captain. "I can still see her."  "The Fatty is sodje=
ring."  "What do you mean=20



by that, Flix?"  "She is wasting her time, and appears to be making not mor=
e than four knots,"=20

replied Felix. "I judge that Captain Mazagan does not feel quite at home." =
 "You think our=20

movements bother him?" suggested Louis.  "Not the least doubt of that! The =
ship is going off at=20

sixteen knots an hour, and will soon be hull down, and we are lying here 'l=
ike a painted ship upon=20

a painted ocean.'"  "Coleridge!" exclaimed Morris, amused to hear Felix quo=
te from a poem.  "In=20

other words, he can't make out what we are driving at; for the Maud has alw=
ays kept under the=20

wing of the Guardian-Mother," added the captain. "But it is about time to g=
ive him something to=20

think of."  As he spoke, Captain Scott rang the gong in the engine-room to =
go ahead, and the=20

screw began to turn again.  "Now keep your weather eye open tight, Flix!" a=
nd he threw the wheel=20

over, and fixed his gaze upon the compass in front of him. "You needn't wat=
ch the G.-M. very=20

closely, but give me the earliest notice of any change in the course of the=
 pirate; for I can hardly=20

make her out now."  "How far is it from here to Port Said?" asked the looko=
utman.  "To where? I=20

don't know where Port Sed is," replied the captain, pronouncing the word as=
 Felix did.  "You don't=20

know where the entrance to the Suez Canal is!" exclaimed the lookout.  "Tha=
t is what you mean, is=20

it?"  "Of course it is; and that is what I said," protested Felix.  "You sa=
id Port Sed."  "I know it; if S-

a-i-d don't spell Sed, what does it spell?" demanded Felix.  "It spells S-a=
-h-i-d out here when you=20

mean the port at the entrance of the Suez Canal," replied the captain quiet=
ly and with a smile.=20

"Oh, you have become an Arabian scholar!" exclaimed Felix with a hearty lau=
gh.  "Honestly, Flix, I=20

did not understand what you meant. I have studied up the navigation in this=
 region," continued=20

Captain Scott, as he took from a drawer in the case on which the binnacle s=
tood a small plan of=20

the port in question. "Look at that, Flix, and tell me what the diaeresis o=
ver the i in Said is for."  "It=20

means that the two vowels in the word are to be pronounced separately, and =
I stand corrected,"=20

answered Felix promptly.  "I did not mean to correct you; for I make too ma=
ny blunders myself to=20

pick up another fellow for doing so. I only wanted to explain why I did not=
 understand you. I had=20

got used to pronouncing it Sah-eed, and Sed does not sound much like it, an=
d I did not take in=20

what you meant, and thought you were talking about some port in the island =
of Cyprus, where we=20

are bound."  "I accept your apology, Captain, and shift all the guilt to my=
 own shoulders. Now may=20

I ask how far it is from here to Port Sah-eed?" replied Felix very good-nat=
uredly.  "It is 101.76=20

miles, by which, of course, I mean knots. I figured it up from a point nort=
h of Rosetta," added the=20

navigator.  "Won't you throw off the fraction?"  "No; if you run one hundre=
d and one miles only, you=20

will fetch up three-quarters of a knot to the westward of the red light at =
the end of the breakwater."=20

"That is putting a fine point on it; but I will go on the hurricane deck an=
d see what the Fatty is=20

about," replied Felix.  "You have not rung the speed bell, Captain Scott, s=
ince you started the=20

screw," suggested Louis.  "I did not intend to do so yet a while," replied =
the captain. "I want to=20

know what the Fatty is about, as Felix calls her; and I think we had better=
 translate her heathen=20

name into plain English."  "Flix's name would apply better to Uncle Moses a=
nd Dr. Hawkes than to=20

the Moorish steamer."  "We had a girl in our high school who bore that name=
, though she was a=20

full-blooded New Yorker; but the master always insisted upon putting the ac=
cent on the first=20

syllable, declaring that was the right way to pronounce it. I know we have =
always pronounced the=20

word Fat'-ee-may, and that is where Flix got the foundation for his abbrevi=
ation."  "Fatty it is,=20

Captain, if you say so. I wonder what the Fatty is about just now?" added L=
ouis.  "Flix will soon=20

enlighten us on that subject, for he has a wonderfully sharp pair of eyes."=
  "Do you really believe=20



we shall get over to Cyprus, Captain Scott?" asked Louis, looking sharply i=
nto the eyes of the=20

navigator.  "Why should we not?"  "Because I don't believe Captain Ringgold=
 intends to turn us=20

loose on the Mediterranean, and let us go it on our own hook, or rather on =
your own hook; for you=20

are the commander, and all the rest of us have to do is to obey your orders=
," said Louis; and the=20

little tiff between them had gently and remotely suggested to him that Capt=
ain Scott had some=20

purpose in his mind which he would not explain to anybody.  His hint that i=
f he were in command=20

of the Guardian-Mother he would make a hole in the side of the Fatime, poin=
ted to something of=20

this kind, though probably it was nothing more than a vague idea. He had su=
ggested the plan upon=20

which the ship and her consort were then acting, and perhaps it had some po=
ssibility of which the=20

commander had not yet dreamed.  "Can you tell me why that steam-yacht of ov=
er six hundred tons=20

is crowding on steam, and running away towards Port Said, while we are, by =
Captain Ringgold's=20

order, headed for Cyprus?" asked the captain.  "Of course I can. He expects=
 by this means to=20

draw off the Fatty, and set her to chasing the Maud, so that the party will=
 not be bothered with any=20

conspiracies while we are going through the canal," replied Louis.  "What t=
hen?"  "If the Fatty=20

chases us, the Guardian-Mother will put in an appearance before any harm co=
mes to the Maud, or=20

to any one on board of her."  "Precisely so; that is the way the business i=
s laid out," replied=20

Captain Scott; but he looked just as though something more might be said wh=
ich he did not care to=20

say.  "But it remains to be shown whether the Fatty will follow the Maud or=
 the ship," added Louis.=20

"She will not follow the Guardian-Mother," said the navigator very decidedl=
y.  "How do you know,=20

Captain? You speak as positively as though Captain Mazagan had told you pre=
cisely what he=20

intended to do."  "Of course he has told me nothing, for I have not seen hi=
m. Common-sense is all=20

I have to guide me."  They were about to go into a further discussion of th=
e question when Felix=20

came tumbling down the ladder from the upper deck as though he was in a hur=
ry.  "What has=20

broken now, Flix?" demanded the captain.  "Nothing; but the question is set=
tled," replied the=20

lookoutman, stopping at the front window of the pilot-house, as though he h=
ad something=20

important to say. "The ship looks like a punctuation mark on the sea, and"-=
-  "Is it a full stop?"=20

asked Captain Scott.  "I don't know; but I think not. She is so far off tha=
t I can't make out=20


_
distant assembly-room: "And my father--how does he stand?"  "The idea of yo=
ur having to ask me=20

how the senator stands in his own State!" exclaimed Gantry. "But really, Ev=
an, I'd give a good bit=20

of hard cash to be able to tell you in so many words just where he does sta=
nd. There are a good=20

many people in our neck of woods who would like mighty well to know. It wil=
l make all the=20

difference in the world when it comes to a show-down."  "Why will it?"  "Be=
cause, apart from the=20

railroad and the anti-railroad factions, there is a very complete and smoot=
hly running machine=20

organization."  "And my father is identified with the machine?"  Again Gant=
ry choked over the=20

singular lack of information discovering itself in Blount's question.  "Lan=
d of glory!" he ejaculated.=20

"Where have you been burying yourself, Evan? Didn't I just tell you that he=
 is the biggest man in=20

the State? Oh, no"--with heavy irony--"he isn't identified with the machine=
--not at all; he merely=20

owns it and runs it. We may think we can swing a safe majority in the legis=
lature, and the 'antis'=20

may be just as firmly convinced that they can. But before either side can t=
urn a wheel it will have to=20

walk up to the captain's office and get its orders."  "Ah," said Blount, an=
d a little later: "Thank you,=20

Dick, I am pretty badly out of touch with the Western political situation, =
as you've discovered."=20

Then he changed the subject abruptly. "How long will your traffic meeting l=
ast?"  "We practically=20

finished to-day. An hour or two on Monday will wind it up."  "After which y=
ou'll go West?"  "After=20

which I shall go West by the Monday noon train if I can make it. You couldn=
't hire me to stay in=20

Boston an hour longer than I have to."  Silence for a time until Blount bro=
ke in upon Gantry's=20

tapping of the dance-music rhythm with: "If I can close up a few unfinished=
 business matters and=20

get ready I may go with you, Dick. Would you mind?"  "Yes; I should mind so=
 much that I'd willingly=20

miss a train or so and worry out a few more of the chilly Boston hours rath=
er than lose the chance=20

of having you along."  "That is good of you, I'm sure. I should bore myself=
 to death if I had to travel=20

alone."  Blount's rejoinder might have passed for a mere friendly commonpla=
ce if it had not been=20

for the rather curiously worded telegram. But it was a goodly portion of Ga=
ntry's business in life to=20

put two and two together, and that phrase in the senator's message about a =
woman's apron-string=20

interested him. Moreover, it was subtly suggestive.  "Ever meet your father=
's--er--the present Mrs.=20

Blount, Evan?" he asked.  "No." Blount may have been Western-born, but the =
chilling=20

discouragement he could crowd into the two-letter negation spoke eloquently=
 of his Eastern=20

training.  Gantry was rebuffed but not disheartened.  "She is a mighty fine=
 woman," he ventured.=20

"So I have been given to understand." This time Blount's reply was icy. But=
 now Gantry's eyes=20

were twinkling and he pressed his advantage.  "You'll have to reckon pretty=
 definitely with her if=20

you go out to the greasewood country, Evan. Next to your father, she is the=
 court of last resort;=20

indeed, there are a good many people who insist that she _is_ the court--th=
e whether she is=20

moving or not; but she is not sending as much smoke out of her funnel as sh=
e was."  "Then your=20

news is a little indefinite."  "As indefinite as a broken barometer. But I =
did not come down to report=20

upon the ship alone," added the lookoutman.  "Give out the text, and go on =
with the sermon."=20

"The text is in the back part of Jonah, where Job swallowed the whale. The =
Fatty has come about=20

and is now under a full head of steam, as nearly as I can judge," said Feli=
x, who thought he was=20

treated with too much levity over a serious subject. "I couldn't see her co=
mpass, but the arrow-

head is directly under the mark, according to my figuring of it."  "Don't b=
e too nautical, Flix; but I=20

suppose you mean that she is headed directly for the Maud," replied the cap=
tain. "That is precisely=20

what I have been satisfied from the beginning she would do."  "Then Morris =
may enter on his log-



slate that the chase began at 11.15 A.M.," said Louis as he glanced at the =
clock over the binnacle.=20

"Not just yet, Morris," replied Captain Scott, who seemed to have no appreh=
ension that the Moor=20

would overhaul the Maud. "Let me have your glass, Flix; and it is your tric=
k at the wheel, Louis."=20

He took the spy-glass and left the pilot-house. They saw him climb the ladd=
er to the hurricane=20

deck, and it was evident that he intended to take a look for himself.  "He =
does not accept my=20

report," said Felix with a laugh.  "But he said just now that you had wonde=
rfully sharp eyes, Flix,"=20

added Louis.  "Yet he will not trust them."  But the captain returned in a =
few minutes, and reported=20

what steamers were in sight, with the added information that none of them w=
ere headed to the=20

north-east; his shipmates could not see the significance of his information=
. He rang the speed bell,=20

and Morris noted the time on the slate.     CHAPTER V  LOUIS BELGRAVE HAS S=
OME=20

MISGIVINGS   Captain Scott had evidently visited the hurricane deck with th=
e spy-glass for the=20

purpose of scanning the sea within eight or ten miles of the Maud, as his r=
eport was that no=20

steamers going in a northeasterly direction were in sight. He did not say t=
hat he feared any=20

interference on the part of such vessels if any were near. At eleven o'cloc=
k it was time for Felix to=20

take his trick at the wheel; Morris's watch, consisting of himself and Loui=
s, were off duty.  It was a=20

very democratic routine that prevailed on board of the little steamer; for =
the captain was no bigger=20

man than the two seamen before the mast, and was obliged to take his turn o=
n the lookout; but the=20

arrangement had been made by the boys, all had agreed to it, and no one cou=
ld complain. Scott=20

went to his place in the bow, taking the glass with him. He had given out t=
he course to his=20

successor at the wheel, and the Maud was now going at full speed.  The dign=
ity of the quarter-

deck does not permit an officer, much less a seaman, to ask questions of hi=
s superior. This sacred=20

limit on board of a ship was entirely constructive so far as the Maud was c=
oncerned; for she was=20

provided with no such planking, and the dignity was applicable only to the =
persons to whom the=20

quarter-deck is appropriated. But Captain Ringgold was a strict disciplinar=
ian, having=20


_
There is one ditch out of which the most persistent and gladsome mocker may=
 not drive his victim,=20

and that is the ditch of silence. Blount said nothing. Nevertheless, Gantry=
 tried once more.  "Not=20

interested, Evan?"  Blount turned and looked his companion coldly in the ey=
es.  "Not in the=20

slightest degree, Dick. Will you take that for your answer now, and remembe=
r it hereafter?"=20

"Sure," laughed the railroad man. And then, to round out the forbidden topi=
c by adding worse to=20

bad: "I didn't know it was a sore spot with you. How should I know? But, as=
 I say, you'll have to=20

reckon with her sooner or later, and--"  "Let's talk of something else," sn=
apped Blount.  Gantry=20

found a match and relighted his cigar. When he began again he was still thi=
nking of the "apron-

string" clause in the senator's telegram.  "I can't understand how any man =
with Western blood in=20

his veins could ever be content to marry and settle down in this over-civil=
ized neck of woods," he=20

remarked, looking down upon the parked automobiles and around at the countr=
y-club evidences of=20

the civilization.  "Can't you?" smiled Blount, with large lenience. One of =
the things the civilization=20

had done for him was to make him good-naturedly tolerant of the crudeness o=
f the outlander.  "No,=20

I can't," asserted the Westerner. Then he added: "Of course, I don't know t=
he Eastern young=20

woman even by sight. She may be all that is lovely, desirable, and enticing=
--if a man could hope to=20

live long enough to get really well acquainted with her."  "She is," declar=
ed Blount, with the air of=20

one who had lived quite long enough to know.  Once more Gantry was putting =
two and two=20

together. Blount's determination to go West and grow up with the country--h=
is father's country--

was apparently a very sudden one. Had the decision turned entirely upon the=
 senator's telegram?=20

Gantry, wise in his generation, thought not.  "You say that as if you'd bee=
n taking a few lessons,"=20

he laughed. Then, with the friendly impudence which only a college comrades=
hip could excuse: "Is=20

she here to-night?"  "No," said Blount, unguardedly making the response whi=
ch admitted so much=20

more than it said.  "Tell me about her," Gantry begged. "I don't often read=
 a love story, but I like to=20

hear 'em."  If it had been any one but Gantry, Blount would probably have h=
ad a sharp attack of=20

reticence, with outward symptoms unmistakable to the dullest. But the time,=
 the surroundings, and=20

the exceeding newness of Patricia's "No" combined to break down the barrier=
s of reserve.  "There=20

isn't much to tell, Dick," he began half humorously, half in ill-concealed =
self-pity. "I've known her=20

for a year, and I've loved her from the first day. That is Chapter One; and=
 Chapter Two ends the=20

story with one small word. She says 'No.'"  "The during the War of the Rebe=
llion.  The young=20

navigators had imbibed this deference from the officers on board of the Gua=
rdian-Mother, and it=20

had become, as it were, a part of their nautical being. It had never been i=
ncorporated in any=20

regulation, but it was just as potent as though it had been set forth in an=
 order from the=20

commander. Captain Scott did not explain what other steamers headed in the =
same direction as=20

the Maud had to do with the present voyage, and it was not in order to make=
 any inquiries; but=20

Louis Belgrave would have been very glad to know what was passing through t=
he mind of his=20

superior officer at this time.  The young commander "made no sign," and all=
 that could be done=20

was to wait until events developed themselves. Morris and Louis were at lib=
erty to go where they=20

pleased, and do what they liked, provided they did not interfere with the r=
outine of the steamer.=20

Both of them were desirous of understanding the situation, and they went up=
on the upper deck in=20

order to obtain a better view of the other vessels.  Morris had a field-gla=
ss which he carried with=20

him. Like everything else the magnate of the Fifth Avenue provided for the =
members of his family,=20

it was of the best quality, and had proved to be a powerful instrument. He =
first looked for the=20



Guardian-Mother; but he could not make her out. The trend of the coast was =
to the southward,=20

beyond Damietta, and she had either gone out of the reach of the glass, or =
she was concealed by=20

the intervening land. The Fatime was very distinctly to be seen, headed for=
 the Maud, and there=20

could be no doubt at all in regard to her intentions. She was in pursuit of=
 the Maud, and her=20

movements very plainly indicated that she was engaged in a mischievous miss=
ion.  "It begins to=20

look serious, don't it, Louis?" asked Morris, after both of them had used t=
he field-glass.  "It would=20

look so if the Guardian-Mother were not somewhere in the vicinity," replied=
 Louis. "Captain=20

Mazagan has waited till she is well out of sight; and I have no doubt he is=
 wondering why our two=20

vessels have separated. At any rate, he has bitten at the bait prepared for=
 him without seeing the=20

hook it conceals."  "I don't see why the plan is not succeeding as well as =
could be desired,"=20

suggested the first officer. "Of course Captain Ringgold does not mean to l=
eave us to fall into the=20

hands of this pirate, as you all call her."  "It was distinctly the underst=
anding that she was to come=20

between us and any possible harm."  "Something may happen to prevent her fr=
om doing so."  "Of=20

course there is no knowing what may happen," Louis admitted. "I do not see =
what can possibly=20

occur to prevent her from following us to Cyprus, if we go there."  "Isn't =
it settled that we are to go=20

there?" asked Morris, who had not=20


_
that's a good sign, isn't it? Haven't I heard somewhere that they always sa=
y 'No' at first?"  Blount=20

laughed in spite of himself. Gantry, the Dick Gantry of the college period,=
 had always been a=20

man's man, gay, light-hearted, and care-free to the outward eye, but in rea=
lity one who was=20

carrying burdens of poverty and distress which might well have crushed an o=
lder and a stronger=20

man. There had been no time for sentiment then, and Blount wondered if ther=
e had been in any=20

later period.  "I am afraid I can't get any comfort out of that suggestion,=
" he returned. "When Miss=20

Patricia Anners says 'No,' I am quite sure she means it."  "Think so?" said=
 Gantry, still=20

sympathetic. "Well, I suppose you are the best judge. Tough, isn't it, old =
man? What's the=20

obstacle?--if you can tell it without tearing the bandages off and saying '=
Ouch!'"  "It is Miss=20

Anners's career."  "H'm," was the doubtful comment; "I'm afraid you'll have=
 to elaborate that a little=20

for me. I'm not up in the 'career' classification."  "She has been studying=
 at home and abroad in=20

preparation for social-settlement work in the large cities. Of course, I kn=
ew about it; but I thought--I=20

hoped--"  "You hoped it was only a young heard the manoeuvre discussed befo=
re the commander=20

of the ship.  "It is not absolutely settled; for the Fatty might take to he=
r heels, and no doubt would=20

do so if she discovered the Guardian-Mother in her wake. Mazagan knows very=
 well that she can=20

make four knots to the Moorish craft's three; for that is just the ratio we=
 figured out between them.=20

With three or four knots the lead she could overhaul her in an hour."  "But=
 the pirate could make=20

her out in clear weather ten or a dozen miles off. But what was Captain Sco=
tt's idea in running for=20

the island of Cyprus?"  "In order to have room enough for his manoeuvre."  =
"Have you kept the run=20

of the Maud's course, Louis?"  "I have not; I am not so much of a sailor as=
 you are, my boy, and I=20

don't figure on sailing the craft unless required to do so," replied Louis.=
 "But why do you ask that=20

question?"  "Because I think the captain has changed the course of the Maud=
, and is headed more=20

to the northward," answered Morris.  "What makes you think so? He gave out =
a north-east course=20

to Flix. You have seen no compass since that time, and the sun is clouded i=
n. I see that Captain=20

Scott is no longer at the bow; he must have gone into the=20
