makes a hole in the wall of the house, enters, and steals the casket of gem=

had left. Charudatta wakes to find casket and thief gone. His wife gives hi=

ACT V., entitled _The Storm_. Evening of the third day.--Charudatta appears=
 in the garden of his=20

house. Here he receives a servant of Vasantasena, who announces that Vasant=

way to visit him. Vasantasena then appears in the street with the courtier;=
 the two describe=20

alternately the violence and beauty of the storm which has suddenly arisen.=
 Vasantasena knowing=20

the use of astuteness, he knows also the importance of good faith. He has a=
 sense of the balance=20

of European power, and anticipates Montesquieu in his theory of the influen=
ce of climates on=20

peoples. There is something of pity, something of irony, in the view which =
he takes of the joyless=20

lot of the great ones of the earth. Having ascertained how few of the combi=
nations of events can=20

be controlled by the wisest calculation, he takes refuge in a faith in Prov=
idence; he finds God=20

necessary to explain this entangled world; and yet his morality is in great=
 part that which tries good=20

and evil by the test of success. By the intensity of his thought Commines s=
ometimes becomes=20

striking in his expression; occasionally he rises to a grave eloquence; occ=
asionally his irony is=20

touched by a bitter humour. But in general he writes with little sentiment =
and no sense of beauty,=20

night at Charudatta's house.  ACT VI., entitled _The Swapping of the Bulloc=

verse was elaborated and reduced to rule; ballade, chant royal, lai, virela=
i, rondeau were the=20

established forms, and lyric verse was often used for matter of a didactic,=
 moral, or satirical=20

tendency. Even Ovid was tediously moralised (_c_. 1300) in some seventy tho=

Chretien Legouais. Literary societies or _puys_[1] were=20

passions in their own persons; if their art is mechanical, yet through it w=
