out of solid granite, Priam scrubbed his finger-nails with a nail-brush lar=

fellows. I went to the door, and when they saw me there, half a hundred old=
 hats were raised and=20

hands were waved in token of farewell.  I thought of our previous fears and=
 of the hard things that=20

had been said, and was ashamed. Again the truth of that humane old proverb =
came home to me:=20

"Almost everybody is a good fellow if you treat him right."  And Blackamoor=
?  A few days later=20

Blackamoor deserted us. A large flock of his wild kindred was mustering in =

autumn migration. We concluded that he had joined his tribe--and were not i=

PARROT THAT HAD BEEN TRAINED TO FIRE A CANNON  By Sir Samuel W. Baker  Ther=
e are=20

no people who surpass the natives of India in the training of elephants or =
other wild animals. For=20

many ages the custom has prevailed among the native princes of that country=
 of educating not=20

only the elephant and the dog, but the leopard and the falcon to assist the=
m in the chase.  The=20

Gaekwar of Baroda, during my sojourn in his State, most kindly furnished me=
 with opportunities of=20

witnessing the excellent training of his falcons, hunting leopards, or chee=
tahs, and other animals.=20

We were also allowed to inspect the immense collection of jewels belonging =
to the Gaekwar.=20

These were in such numbers and variety that I quite lost my respect for dia=
monds and rubies,=20

although one of the former had actually been purchased for $450,000.  The g=
old and silver=20

batteries of field-guns were also exhibited. There are only four of these c=
annon, two of which are=20

solid gold four-pounders, fitted with an internal tube of steel. The carria=
ges are plated with gold,=20

and the harness for the team of oxen is heavily ornamented with the same pr=
ecious metal. Gold=20

horns are fitted upon those of the oxen employed, and these animals are sel=
ected for their=20

immense size and general perfection of appearance.  The silver guns, carria=
ges, limbers, harness,=20

etc., were precisely similar.  The most interesting artilleryman in his Hig=
hness's service was a=20

small green parrot. This bird was one of many which had been trained to the=
 various exercises of=20

a field-gun, and it was exhibited by its native tutor in our presence.  A l=
arge table was placed in the=20

arena where rhinoceros, buff aloes, and rams had been recently struggling f=
or victory in their=20

various duels, and a far more entertaining exhibition was exchanged for the=
 savage conflicts....=20

Upon this table stood a model brass cannon about eight inches in length of =
barrel, and a calibre=20

equal to a No. 12 smooth-bore gun. The rammer and sponger lay by the side o=
f the small field-

piece.  About a dozen green parrots were spectators, who were allowed to re=
main on perches,=20

while the best-trained gunner was to perform in public before at least thre=
e thousand Putney High=20

Street at night; two omnibus horses stepped strongly and willingly out of a=
 dark side street, and=20

under the cold glare of the main road they somehow took on the quality of e=
questrian sculpture.=20

The altercation of lights was in the highest degree complex. Priam understo=
od immediately, from=20

the man's calm glance at the picture, and the position which he instinctive=
ly took up to see it, that=20

he was accustomed to looking at pictures. The visitor did not start back, n=
or rush forward, nor=20

dissolve into hysterics, nor behave as though confronted by the ghost of a =
murdered victim. He=20

just gazed at the picture, keeping his nerve and holding his tongue. And ye=
t it was not an easy=20

picture to look at. It was a picture of an advanced experimentalism, and wo=
uld have appealed to=20

nothing but the sense of humour in a person not a connoisseur.  "Sell!" exc=
laimed Priam. Like all=20

shy men he could hide his shyness in an exaggerated familiarity. "What pric=
e this?" And he=20

pointed to the picture.  There were no other preliminaries.  "It is excessi=
vely distinguished,"=20

murmured Mr. Oxford, in the accents of expert appreciation. "Excessively di=
stinguished. May I ask=20

how much?"  "That's what I'm asking you," said Priam, fiddling with a paint=
 rag.  "Hum!" observed=20



Mr. Oxford, and gazed in silence. Then: "Two hundred and fifty?"  Priam had=
 virtually promised to=20

deliver that picture to the picture-framer on the next day, and he had not =
expected to receive a=20

penny more than twelve pounds for it. But artists are strange organisms.  H=
e shook his head.=20

Although two hundred and fifty pounds was as much as he had earned in the p=
revious twelve=20

months, he shook his grey head.  "No?" said Mr. Oxford kindly and respectfu=
lly, putting his hands=20

behind his back. "By the way," he turned with eagerness to Priam, "I presum=
e you have seen the=20

portrait of Ariosto by Titian that they've bought for the National Gallery?=
 What is your opinion of it,=20

_maitre_?" He stood expectant, glowing with interest.  "Except that it isn'=
t Ariosto, and it certainly=20

isn't by Titian, it's a pretty high-class sort of thing," said Priam.  Mr. =
Oxford smiled with appreciative=20

content, nodding his head. "I hoped you would say so," he remarked. And swi=
ftly he passed on to=20

Segantini, then to J.W. Morrice, and then to Bonnard, demanding the _maitre=
's_ views. In a few=20

moments they were really discussing pictures. And it was years since Priam =
had listened to the=20

voice of informed common sense on the subject of painting. It was years sin=
ce he had heard=20

anything but exceeding puerility concerning pictures. He had, in fact, accu=
stomed himself not to=20

listen; he had excavated a passage direct from one ear to the other for suc=
h remarks. And now he=20

drank up the conversation of Mr.=20


_
his ministers, and friends, including ourselves, being seated in a raised s=
tructure similar to the=20

grand stand of an English racecourse, which commanded the entire arena, the=
 parrots being=20

immediately beneath.  The gunner was placed upon the table, and at once too=
k its stand by the=20

gun, and, in an attitude of attention, waited for orders from its native ma=
ster.  The word of=20

command was given, and the parrot instantly seized the sponger in its beak,=
 and inserting it within=20

the muzzle without the slightest difficulty, vigorously moved it backwards =
and forwards, and then=20

replaced it in its former position.  The order was now given "to load." A c=
artridge was lying on the=20

table, which the bird immediately took within its beak, and dexterously ins=
erted in the muzzle; it=20

then seized the rammer, and, with great determination of purpose and force,=
 rammed the cartridge=20

completely home, giving it several sharp taps when at the breech. The parro=
t replaced the rammer=20

by the side of the sponger, and waited for further orders, standing erect c=
lose to the rear of the=20

gun.  The trainer poured a pinch of priming powder upon the touch-hole, and=
 lighted a small port-

fire; this he gave to the parrot, which received it in its beak at a right =
angle, and then stood by its=20

gun, waiting for the word.  "Fire!" ... At that instant the parrot applied =
the match, and the report of=20

the cannon was so loud that most people started at the sound; but the prett=
y green gunner never=20

flinched--the parrot stood by its gun quite unmoved. The trainer took the p=
ort-fire, which it had=20

never dropped from its beak, and gave an order to sponge the gun, which was=
 immediately=20

executed, the bird appearing to be quite delighted at its success.    THE S=
ANDPIPER'S TRICK  By=20

Celia Thaxter  One lovely afternoon in May I had been wandering up and down=
, through rocky=20

gorges, by little swampy bits of ground, and on the tops of windy headlands=
, looking for flowers,=20

and had found many: --large blue violets, the like of which you never saw; =
white violets, too,=20

creamy and fragrant; gentle little houstonias; gay and dancing erythroniums=
, and wind-flowers=20

delicately tinted, blue, straw-color, pink, and purple. I never found such =
in the mainland valleys; the=20

salt air of the sea deepens the colors of all flowers. I stopped by a swamp=
 which the recent rains=20

had filled and turned to a little lake. Light green iris-leaves cut the wat=
er like sharp and slender=20

swords, and, in the low sunshine that streamed across, threw long shadows o=
ver the shining=20

surface.  Some blackbirds were calling sweetly in a clump of bushes, and so=
ng-sparrows sang as=20

if they had but one hour in which to crowd the whole raptures of the spring=
. As I pressed through=20

the budding bayberry bushes to reach some milk-white sprays of shadbush whi=
ch grew by the=20

water-side, I startled three curfews. They flew away, trailing their long l=
egs, and whistling fine and=20

clear. I stood still to watch them out of sight. How full the air was of pl=
easant sounds! The very=20

waves made a glad noise about the rocks, and the whole sea seemed to roar a=
far off, as if half=20

asleep and murmuring in a kind of gentle dream. The flock of sheep was scat=
tered here and there,=20

all washed as white as snow by the plenteous rains, and nibbling the new gr=
ass eagerly; and from=20

near and far came the tender and plaintive cries of the young lambs.  Going=
 on again, I came to=20

the edge of a little beach, and presently I was startled by a sound of such=
 terror and distress that it=20

went to my heart at once.  In a moment a poor little sandpiper emerged from=
 the bushes, dragging=20

itself along in such a way that, had you seen it, you would have concluded =
that every bone in its=20

body had been broken. Such a dilapidated bird! Its wings drooped and its le=
gs hung as if almost=20

lifeless. It uttered continually a shrill cry of pain, and kept just out of=
 the reach of my hand,=20

fluttering hither and thither, as if sore wounded and weary. At first I was=
 amazed, and cried out,=20

"Why, friend and gossip! What is the matter?" and then stood watching it in=
 mute dismay.=20



Suddenly it flashed across me that this was only my sandpiper's way of conc=
ealing from me a=20

nest; and I remembered reading about this little trick of hers in a book of=
 natural history. The object=20

was to make me follow her by pretending that she could not fly, and so lead=
 me away from her=20

treasure. So I stood perfectly still, lest I should tread on the precious h=
abitation, and quietly=20

observed my deceitful little friend.  Her apparently desperate and hopeless=
 condition grew so=20

comical when I reflected that it was only affectation, that I could not hel=
p laughing, loud and long.=20

"Dear gossip," I called to her, "pray don't give yourself so much unnecessa=
ry trouble! You might=20

know I wouldn't hurt you or your nest for the world, you most absurd of bir=
ds!"  As if she=20

understood me, and as if she could not bear being ridiculed, up she rose at=
 once, strong and=20

graceful, and flew off with a full, round, clear note, delicious to hear.  =
Then I cautiously looked for=20

the nest, and found it quite close to my feet, near the stem of a stunted b=
ayberry bush. Mrs.=20

Sandpiper had only drawn together a few bayberry leaves, brown and glossy, =
a little pale green=20

lichen, and a twig or two, and that was a pretty enough house for her. Four=
 eggs, about as large=20

as robins', were within, all laid evenly with the small ends together, as i=
s the tidy fashion of the=20

Sandpiper family. No wonder I did not see them; for they were pale green li=
ke the lichen, with=20

brown spots the color of the leaves and twigs, and they seemed a part of th=
e ground, with its=20

confusion of soft neutral tints. I couldn't admire them enough, but, to rel=
ieve my little friend's=20

anxiety, I came very soon away; and as I came, I marvelled much that so ver=
y small a head should=20

contain such an amount of cunning.    HOW DID THE CANARY DO IT?  By Celia T=
haxter  A little=20

friend of mine, who was going away for the winter, asked me to take charge =
of one of her canaries=20

till she returned in the spring. The bird was a foreigner, born and bred in=
 Fayal, and brought across=20

the water in his youth, a gray-green and golden little creature, whose name=
 was Willie.  I gladly=20

consented, and one day Willie was brought over from Jamaica Plains, a dista=
nce of ten miles, and=20

deposited in my parlor. His cage was closely covered with brown paper durin=
g the journey, and he=20

came in the cars, by the roundabout way of Boston.  At first he seemed some=
what lonely and lost,=20

but soon grew very happy and content in his new home; and well he might be,=
 for he had all his=20

wants supplied, and did not lack companions.  I had two canaries, a robin, =
and a song-sparrow,=20

and they soon began to make beautiful music all together.  The sun could no=
t rise without shining=20

into the parlor windows; it lingered there all day, till the last glow of t=
he evening-red faded out of=20

the sky. At two windows the light streamed through green leaves and gay flo=
wers, and made a=20

most cheerful atmosphere, in which no bird could possibly help singing. The=
 song-sparrow's clear,=20

friendly notes seemed to bring May to the very door; and the robin executed=
, _sotto voce,_ all his=20

fine out-of-door melodies, and put one into an April mood with his sweet, m=
elancholy rain-song.=20

Willie could not choose but be happy. So they all sang and chirruped togeth=
er the whole winter=20

through, and cheered us in that cold, sad season. Slowly the earth turned d=
aily more and more=20

toward the sun, and before we were ready to realize so much joy, the "willo=
w-wands" were=20

spangled with "downy silver," and the alder catkins began to unwind their l=
ong spirals, and swing=20

pliant in the first winds of March. Then the melting airs of April set the =
brooks free, the frogs began=20

to pipe, and there was rare music! Birds came in flocks, the soft green gra=
ss stole gradually over=20

the land, and dandelions shone gay in the meadows. When beneath a southern =
window the=20

flowering almond blossomed, I kept the windows open during fine weather, an=
d left the bird cages=20

on the sill the whole day. Little wild birds came and sat on the grapevine =
trellis above, and=20



twittered and talked with the captives, and sometimes alighted on the cages=
; the pink almond=20

sprays waved round them, and all were, or seemed to be, as happy as the day=
 is long.  Willie's=20

little mistress returned about this time, and I only awaited a proper oppor=
tunity to return my=20

charge, safe and well, into her hands. I congratulated myself on his state =
of health and spirits, and=20

thought how glad she would be to see him again. But, alas! for human calcul=
ations. One afternoon=20

I went, as usual, to take in the cage for the night: there was Dick, the ro=
bin; and Philip, the=20

sparrow; and slender Rupert, my own canary, and his mate; but Willie of Fay=
al, the green and=20

golden stranger, was gone, cage and all. I looked out of the window; there =
lay the cage upon the=20

ground, empty. Imagine my consternation! Had some strange, prowling cat dev=
oured--? I was in=20

despair at the thought.  "If it had been any one but Willie," I said, again=
 and again. He had been=20

intrusted to my care; what should I say when he was required of me? In real=
 sorrow I wrote to my=20

youthful friend and told her all. She mourned her bird as dead, but only fo=
r a day; for what do you=20

think happened? The most surprising thing! You never will guess; so I shall=
 tell you all, at once.=20

Willie was not devoured; he escaped from his cage, and flew unerringly back=
 to his former home,=20

ten miles from mind. He grew warmer, more enthusiastic, more impassioned. A=
nd Mr. Oxford=20

listened with ecstasy. Mr. Oxford had apparently a natural discretion. He s=
imply accepted Priam,=20

as he stood, for a great painter. No reference to the enigma why a great pa=
inter should be painting=20

in an attic in Werter Road, Putney! No inconvenient queries about the great=
 painter's previous=20

history and productions. Just the frank, full acceptance of his genius! It =
was odd, but it was=20

comfortable.  "So you won't take two hundred and fifty?" asked Mr. Oxford, =
hopping back to=20

business.  "No," said Priam sturdily. "The truth is," he added, "I should r=
ather like to keep that=20

picture for myself."  "Will you take five hundred, _maitre_?"  "Yes, I supp=
ose I will," and Priam=20

sighed. A genuine sigh! For he would really have liked to keep the picture.=
 He knew he had never=20

painted a better.  "And may I carry it away with me?" asked Mr. Oxford.  "I=
 expect so," said Priam.=20

"I wonder if I might venture to ask you to come back to town with me?" Mr. =
Oxford went on, in=20

gentle deference. "I have one or two pictures I should very much like you t=
o see, and I fancy they=20

might give you pleasure. And we could talk over future business. If possibl=
y you could spare an=20

hour or so. If I might request----"  A desire rose in Priam's breast and fo=
ught against his timidity.=20

The tone in which Mr. Oxford had said "I fancy they might give you pleasure=
" appeared to indicate=20

something very much out of the common. And Priam could scarcely recollect w=
hen last his eyes=20

had rested on a picture that was at once unfamiliar and great.   _Parfitts'=
 Galleries_   I have=20

already indicated that the machine was somewhat out of the ordinary. It was=
, as a fact,=20

exceedingly out of the ordinary. It was much larger than electric carriages=
 usually are. It had what=20

the writers of 'motoring notes' in papers written by the wealthy for the we=
althy love to call a=20

'limousine body.' And outside and in, it was miraculously new and spotless.=
 On the ivory handles=20

of its doors, on its soft yellow leather upholstery, on its cedar woodwork,=
 on its patent blind=20

apparatus, on its silver fittings, on its lamps, on its footstools, on its =
silken arm-slings--not the=20

minutest trace of usage! Mr. Oxford's car seemed to show that Mr. Oxford ne=
ver used a car twice,=20

purchasing a new car every morning, like stockbrokers their silk hats, or t=
he Duke of Selsea his=20

trousers. There was a table in the 'body' for writing, and pockets up and d=
own devised to hold=20

documents, also two arm-chairs, and a suspended contrivance which showed th=
e hour, the=20

temperature, and the fluctuations of the barometer; there was also a speaki=
ng-tube. One felt that if=20



the machine had been connected by wireless telegraphy with the Stock Exchan=
ge, the leading=20

studios and the Houses of Parliament, and if a little restaurant had been c=
onstructed in the rear,=20

Mr. Oxford might never have been under the necessity of leaving the car; th=
at he might have=20

passed all his days in it from morn to latest eve.  The perfection of the m=
achine and of Mr.=20

Oxford's attire and complexion caused Priam to look rather shabby. Indeed, =
he was rather shabby.=20

Shabbiness had slightly overtaken him in Putney. Once he had been a dandy; =
but that was in the=20

lamented Leek's time. And as the car glided, without smell and without nois=
e, through the=20

encumbered avenues of London towards the centre, now shooting forward like =
a star, now=20

stopping with gentle suddenness, now swerving in a swift curve round a vehi=
cle earthy and=20

leaden-wheeled, Priam grew more and more uncomfortable. He had sunk into a =
groove at Putney.=20

He never left Putney, save occasionally to refresh himself at the National =
Gallery, and thither he=20

invariably went by train and tube, because the tube always filled him with =
wonder and romance,=20

and always threw him up out of the earth at the corner of Trafalgar Square =
with such a strange=20

exhilaration in his soul. So that he had not seen the main avenues of Londo=
n for a long time. He=20

had been forgetting riches and luxury, and the oriental cigarette-shops who=
se proprietors' names=20

end in 'opoulos,' and the haughtiness of the ruling classes, and the still =
sterner haughtiness of their=20

footmen. He had now abandoned Alice in Putney. And a mysterious demon seize=
d him and=20

gripped him, and sought to pull him back in the direction of the simplicity=
 of Putney, and struggled=20

with him fiercely, and made him writhe and shrink before the brilliant phen=
omena of London's=20

centre, and indeed almost pitched him out of the car and set him running as=
 hard as legs would=20

carry to Putney. It was the demon which we call habit. He would have given =
a picture to be in=20

Putney, instead of swimming past Hyde Park Corner to the accompaniment of M=
r. Oxford's=20

amiable and deferential and tactful conversation.  However, his other demon=
, shyness, kept him=20

from imperiously stopping the car.  The car stopped itself in Bond Street, =
in front of a building with=20

a wide archway, and the symbol of empire floating largely over its roof. Pl=
acards said that=20

admission through the archway was a shilling; but Mr. Oxford, bearing Priam=
's latest picture as=20

though it had cost fifty thousand instead of five hundred pounds, went stra=
ight into the place=20

without paying, and Priam accepted his impressive invitation to follow. Age=
d military veterans=20

whose breasts carried a row of medals saluted Mr. Oxford as he entered, and=
, within the=20

penetralia, beings in silk hats as faultless as Mr. Oxford's raised those h=
ats to Mr. Oxford, who did=20

not raise his in reply. Merely nodded, Napoleonically! His demeanour had gr=
eatly changed. You=20

saw here the man of unbending will, accustomed to use men as pawns in the c=
hess of a=20

complicated career. Presently they reached a private office where Mr. Oxfor=
d, with the assistance=20

of a page, removed his gloves, furs, and hat, and sent sharply for a man wh=
o at once brought a=20

frame which fitted Priam's picture.  "Do have a cigar," Mr. Oxford urged Pr=
iam, with a quick return=20

to his earlier manner, offering a box in which each cigar was separately en=
cased in gold-leaf. The=20

cigar was such as costs a crown in a restaurant, half-a-crown in a shop, an=
d twopence in=20

Amsterdam. It was a princely cigar, with the odour of paradise and an ash a=
s white as snow. But=20

Priam could not appreciate it. No! He had seen on a beaten copper plate und=
er the archway these=20

words: 'Parfitts' Galleries.' He was in the celebrated galleries of his for=
mer dealers, whom by the=20

way he had never seen. And he was afraid. He was mortally apprehensive, and=
 had a sickly=20

sensation in the stomach.  After they had scrupulously inspected the pictur=
e, through the clouds of=20



incense, Mr. Oxford wrote out a cheque for five hundred pounds, and, cigar =
in mouth, handed it to=20

Priam, who tried to take it with a casual air and did not succeed. It was s=
igned 'Parfitts'.'  "I dare=20

say you have heard that I'm now the sole proprietor of this place," said Mr=
. Oxford through his=20

cigar.  "Really!" said Priam, feeling just as nervous as an inexperienced y=
outh.  Then Mr. Oxford=20

led Priam over thick carpets to a saloon where electric light was thrown by=
 means of reflectors on=20

to a small but incomparable band of pictures. Mr. Oxford had not exaggerate=
d. They did give=20

pleasure to Priam. They were not the pictures one sees every day, nor once =
a year. There was the=20

finest Delacroix of its size that Priam had ever met with; also a Vermeer t=
hat made it unnecessary=20

to visit the Ryks Museum. And on the more distant wall, to which Mr. Oxford=
 came last, in a place=20

of marked honour, was an evening landscape of Volterra, a hill-town in Ital=
y. The bolts of Priam's=20

very soul started when he caught sight of that picture. On the lower edge o=
f the rich frame were=20

two words in black lettering: 'Priam Farll.' How well he remembered paintin=
g it! And how=20

masterfully beautiful it was!  "Now that," said Mr. Oxford, "is in my humbl=
e opinion one of the finest=20

Farlls in existence. What do you think, Mr. Leek?"  Priam paused. "I agree =
with you," said he.=20

"Farll," said Mr. Oxford, "is about the only modern painter that can stand =
the company that that=20

picture has in this room, eh?"  Priam blushed. "Yes," he said.  There is a =
considerable difference,=20

in various matters, between Putney and Volterra; but the picture of Volterr=
a and the picture of=20

Putney High Street were obviously, strikingly, incontestably, by the same h=
and; one could not but=20

perceive the same brush-work, the same masses, the same manner of seeing an=
d of grasping, in=20

a word the same dazzling and austere translation of nature. The resemblance=
 jumped at one and=20

shook one by the shoulders. It could not have escaped even an auctioneer. Y=
et Mr. Oxford did not=20

refer to it. He seemed quite blind to it. All he said was, as they left the=
 room, and Priam finished his=20

rather monosyllabic praise--  "Yes, that's the little collection I've just =
got together, and I am very=20

proud to have shown it to you. Now I want you to come and lunch with me at =
my club. Please do. I=20

should be desolated if you refused."  Priam did not care a halfpenny about =
the desolation of Mr.=20

Oxford; and he most sincerely objected to lunch at Mr. Oxford's club. But h=
e said "Yes" because it=20

was the easiest thing for his shyness to do, Mr. Oxford being a determined =
man. Priam was afraid=20

to go. He was disturbed, alarmed, affrighted, by the mystery of Mr. Oxford'=
s silence.  They arrived=20

at the club in the car.   _The Club_   Priam had never been in a club befor=
e. The statement may=20


_
after he disappeared from my window, he was heard pecking at the window of =
the little girl's=20

chamber, but no one noticed him; so he stayed about the house till morning,=
 and flew in when the=20

window was opened, and was found perched on the cage of his old companion. =
 Great was=20

everybody's astonishment, as you may imagine. There was no mistaking him,--=
it was Willie, and=20

no other.  Yes, really and truly. Now, how do you suppose he found his way =
over all those miles of=20

unfamiliar country, straight to that chamber window? _What_ guided him? Did=
 he fly high or low?=20

Probably not high; for his wings were unused to flying at all, and conseque=
ntly not strong; but they=20

bore him over woods and fields, over streets and people, over hundreds of h=
ouses, till at last his=20

tired eyes beheld the tower and gables of his old dwelling-place rising fro=
m among the pleasant=20

woods, and then he knew he might rest in safety.  But how _could_ he find t=
he way? Supposing=20

birds to have means of communicating with each other by speech, how would h=
e have put his=20

questions, wishing to ask his way? Meeting a thrush, or sparrow, or any oth=
er dainty feathered=20

creature, he might perhaps have hailed it with,--"Good morrow, comrade;" bu=
t he couldn't have=20

said, "Can you tell me the way to Jamaica Plains?" or, "Do you know where t=
he little girl lives to=20

whom I belong? Her name is May, and she has golden hair; can you tell me ho=
w to find her?" Do=20

you think he could? Yet he did find her, and until last summer, was still l=
iving in that pretty=20

chamber among the green trees.  Some time, perhaps, we shall understand tho=
se things; but until=20

then, Willie's journey must remain one of the mysterious incidents in natur=
al history.    A=20

RUNAWAY WHALE  By Captain O.G. Fosdick  "Now, boys," said Captain Daniel, "=
draw your skiff=20

up beside the _Greyhound,_ and I'll tell you a story of how I was once run =
away with by a whale."=20

We boys did as we were bid, even meet with incredulity, but it is true. He =
had left the land of clubs=20

early in life. As for the English clubs in European towns, he was familiar =
with their exteriors, and=20

with the amiable babble of their supporters at _tables d'hote,_ and his des=
ire for further knowledge=20

had not been so hot as to inconvenience him. Hence he knew nothing of clubs=
.  Mr. Oxford's club=20

alarmed and intimidated him; it was so big and so black. Externally it rese=
mbled a town-hall of=20

some great industrial town. As you stood on the pavement at the bottom of t=
he flight of giant steps=20

that led to the first pair of swinging doors, your head was certainly lower=
 than the feet of a being=20

who examined you sternly from the other side of the glass. Your head was al=
so far below the sills=20

of the mighty windows of the ground-floor. There were two storeys above the=
 ground-floor, and=20

above them a projecting eave of carven stone that threatened the uplifted e=
ye like a menace. The=20

tenth part of a slate, the merest chip of a corner, falling from the lofty =
summit of that pile, would=20

have slain elephants. And all the facade was black, black with ages of carb=
onic deposit. The=20

notion that the building was a town-hall that had got itself misplaced and =
perverted gradually left=20

you as you gazed. You perceived its falseness. You perceived that Mr. Oxfor=
d's club was a=20

monument, a relic of the days when there were giants on earth, that it had =
come down unimpaired=20

to a race of pigmies, who were making the best of it. The sole descendant o=
f the giants was the=20

scout behind the door. As Mr. Oxford and Priam climbed towards it, this uni=
que giant, with a=20

giant's force, pulled open the gigantic door, and Mr. Oxford and Priam walk=
ed imperceptibly in,=20

and the door swung to with a large displacement of air. Priam found himself=
 in an immense=20

interior, under a distant carved ceiling, far, far upwards, like heaven. He=
 watched Mr. Oxford write=20

his name in a=20


_
tideway. We clambered on board the _Greyhound_ and, seating ourselves or th=
e transom, waited=20

for Captain Daniel to begin. Taking a match from his waistcoat pocket and l=
ighting a long clay=20

pipe, he spoke:  Along in the fifties I was cabin-boy on the whaling-ship _=
Nimrod_, Alarson Coffin,=20

master. We were cruising on the coast of Brazil when, one day, the lookout,=
 stationed at the=20

masthead, reported a accomplished, Mr. Oxford led him past enormous vistas =
to right and left, into=20

a very long chamber, both of whose long walls were studded with thousands u=
pon thousands of=20

massive hooks--and here and there upon a hook a silk hat or an overcoat. Mr=
. Oxford chose a=20

couple of hooks in the expanse, and when they had divested themselves suffi=
ciently he led Priam=20

forwards into another great chamber evidently=20
