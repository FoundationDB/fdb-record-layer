orkshops.  5. But since, on account of the proximity of the stone-quarries =
of Grotta Rossa, Palla, and the others that are nearest to the city, necess=
ity drives us to make use of their products, we must proceed as follows, if=
 we wish our work to be finished without flaws. Let the stone be taken from=
 the quarry two years before building is to household of my childhood, once=
 a big and noisy family, no one remained but the governess Mademoiselle Mar=
ie, or, as she was now called, Marya Gerasimovna, an absolutely insignifica=
nt person. She was a precise little old lady of seventy, who wore a light g=
rey dress and a cap with white ribbons, and looked like a china doll. She a=
lways sat in the _
beneath them huge fires of burning sulphur or alum or asphalt. So the fire =
and the heat of the=20

flames, coming up hot from far within through the fissures, make the soil t=
here light, and the tufa=20

found there is spongy and free from moisture. Hence, when the three substan=
ces, all formed on a=20

similar principle by the force of fire, are mixed together, the water sudde=
nly taken in makes them=20

cohere, and the moisture quickly hardens them so that they set into a mass =
which neither the=20

waves nor the force of the water can dissolve.  2. That there is burning he=
at in these regions may=20

be proved by the further fact that in the mountains near Baiae, which belon=
gs to the Cumaeans,=20

there are places excavated to serve as sweating-baths, where the intense he=
at that comes from=20

far below bores its way through the earth, owing to the force of the fire, =
and passing up appears in=20

these regions, thus making remarkably good sweating-baths. Likewise also it=
 is related that in=20

ancient times the tides of heat, swelling and overflowing from under Mt. Ve=
suvius, vomited forth=20

fire from the mountain upon the neighbouring country. Hence, what is called=
 "sponge-stone" or=20

"Pompeian pumice" appears to have been reduced by burning from another kind=
 of stone to the=20

condition of the kind which we see.  3. The kind of sponge-stone taken from=
 this region is not=20

produced everywhere else, but only about Aetna and among the hills of Mysia=
 which the Greeks=20

call the "Burnt District," and in other places of the same peculiar nature.=
 Seeing that in such places=20

there are found hot springs and warm vapour in excavations on the mountains=
, and that the=20

ancients tell us that there were once fires spreading over the fields in th=
ose very regions, it seems=20

to be certain that moisture has been extracted from the tufa and earth, by =
the force of fire, just as it=20

is from limestone in kilns.  4. Therefore, when different and unlike things=
 have been subjected to=20

the action of fire and thus reduced to the same condition, if after this, w=
hile in a warm, dry state,=20

they are suddenly saturated with water, there is an effervescence of the he=
at latent in the bodies=20

of them all, and this makes them firmly unite and quickly assume the proper=
ty of one solid mass.=20

There will still be the question why Tuscany, although it abounds in hot sp=
rings, does not furnish a=20

powder out of which, on the same principle, a wall can be made which will s=
et fast under water. I=20

have therefore thought best to explain how this seems to be, re-use it unde=
r the terms of the=20

The Lottery Ticket     THE WIFE  I  I RECEIVED the following letter:  "DEAR=
 SIR, PAVEL=20

ANDREITCH!  "Not far from you--that is to say, in the village of Pestrovo--=
very distressing=20

incidents are taking place, concerning which I feel it my duty to write to =
you. All the peasants of=20

that village sold their cottages and all their belongings, and set off for =
the province of Tomsk, but=20

did not succeed in getting there, and have come back. Here, of course, they=
 have nothing now;=20

everything belongs to other people. They have settled three or four familie=
s in a hut, so that there=20

are no less than fifteen persons of both sexes in each hut, not counting th=
e young children; and=20

the long and the short of it is, there is nothing to eat. There is famine a=
nd there is a terrible=20



pestilence of hunger, or spotted, typhus; literally every one is stricken. =
The doctor's assistant says=20

one goes into a cottage and what does one see? Every one is sick, every one=
 delirious, some=20

laughing, others frantic; the huts are filthy; there is no one to fetch the=
m water, no one to give them=20

a drink, and nothing to eat but frozen potatoes. What can Sobol (our Zemstv=
o doctor) and his lady=20

assistant do when more than medicine the peasants need bread which they hav=
e not? The District=20

Zemstvo refuses to assist them, on the ground that their names have been ta=
ken off the register of=20

this district, and that they are now reckoned as inhabitants of Tomsk; and,=
 besides, the Zemstvo=20

has no money.  "Laying these facts before you, and knowing your humanity, I=
 beg you not to=20

refuse immediate help.  "Your well-wisher."  Obviously the letter was writt=
en by the doctor with the=20

animal name* or his lady assistant. Zemstvo doctors and their assistants go=
 on for years growing=20


_
be raised.  5. The same kinds of soil are not found in all places and count=
ries alike, nor is stone=20

found everywhere. Some soils are earthy; others gravelly, and again pebbly;=
 in other places the=20

material is sandy; in a word, the properties of the soil are as different a=
nd unlike as are the various=20

countries. In particular, it may be observed that sandpits are hardly ever =
lacking in any place within=20

the districts of Italy and Tuscany which are bounded by the Apennines; wher=
eas across the=20

Apennines toward the Adriatic none are found, and in Achaea and Asia Minor =
or, in short, across=20

the sea, the very term is unknown. Hence it is not in all the places where =
boiling springs of hot=20

water abound, that there is the same combination of favourable circumstance=
s which has been=20

described above. For things are produced in accordance with the will of nat=
ure; not to suit man's=20

pleasure, but as it were by a chance distribution.  6. Therefore, where the=
 mountains are not=20

earthy but consist of soft stone, the force of the fire, passing through th=
e fissures in the stone, sets=20

it afire. The soft and delicate part is burned out, while the hard part is =
left. Consequently, while in=20

Campania the burning of the earth makes ashes, in Tuscany the combustion of=
 the stone makes=20

carbuncular sand. Both are excellent in walls, but one is better to use for=
 buildings on land, the=20

other for piers under salt water. The Tuscan stone is softer in quality tha=
n tufa but harder than=20

earth, and being thoroughly kindled by the violent heat from below, the res=
ult is the production in=20

some places of the kind of sand called carbuncular.  [Illustration: TRAVERT=

e top of the rock=20

o which the rock has=20

nd, with their=20

varieties and points of excellence. Next comes the consideration of stone-q=
uarries from which=20

dimension stone and supplies of rubble to be used in building are taken and=
 brought together. The=20

stone in quarries is found to be of different and unlike qualities. In some=
 it is soft: for example, in=20

the environs of the city at the quarries of Grotta Rossa, Palla, Fidenae, a=
nd of the Alban hills; in=20

others, it is medium, as at Tivoli, at Amiternum, or Mt. Soracte, and in qu=
arries of this sort; in still=20

others it is hard, as in lava quarries. There are also numerous other kinds=
: for instance, in=20

Campania, red and black tufas; in Umbria, Picenum, and Venetia, white tufa =
which can be cut with=20

a toothed saw, like wood.  2. All these soft kinds have the advantage that =
they can be easily=20

worked as soon as they have been taken from the quarries. Under cover they =
play their part well;=20

but in open and exposed situations the frost and rime make them crumble, an=
d they go to pieces.=20

On the seacoast, too, the salt eats away and dissolves them, nor can they s=
tand great heat either.=20

But travertine and all stone of that class can stand injury whether from a =
heavy load laid upon it or=20

from the weather; exposure to fire, however, it cannot bear, but splits and=
 cracks to pieces at=20

once. This is because in its natural composition there is but little moistu=
re and not much of the=20

earthy, but a great deal of air and of fire. Therefore, it is not only with=
out the earthy and watery=20

elements, but when fire, expelling the air from it by the operation and for=
ce of heat, penetrates into=20

its inmost parts and occupies the empty spaces of the fissures, there comes=
 a great glow and the=20

stone is made to burn as fiercely as do the particles of fire itself.  3. T=
here are also several=20

quarries called Anician in the territory of Tarquinii, the stone being of t=
he colour of peperino. The=20

principal workshops lie round the lake of Bolsena and in the prefecture of =
Statonia. This stone has=20

innumerable good qualities. Neither the season of frost nor exposure to fir=
e can harm it, but it and=20

yet continue to receive their salaries from people who are living upon froz=
en potatoes, and=20



consider they have a right to judge whether I am humane or not.       *Sobo=
l in Russian means=20

"sable-marten."--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.  Worried by the anonymous letter and by=
 the fact that=20

peasants came every morning to the servants' kitchen and went down on their=
 knees there, and=20

that twenty sacks of rye had been stolen at night out of the barn, the wall=
 having first been broken=20

in, and by the general depression which was fostered by conversations, news=
papers, and horrible=20

weather--worried by all this, I worked listlessly and ineffectively. I was =
writing "A History of=20

Railways"; I had to read a great number of Russian and foreign books, pamph=
lets, and articles in=20

the magazines, to make calculations, to refer to logarithms, to think and t=
o write; then again to=20

read, calculate, and think; but as soon as I took up a book or began to thi=
nk, my thoughts were in=20

a muddle, my eyes began blinking, I would get up from the table with a sigh=
 and begin walking=20

about the big rooms of my deserted country-house. When I was tired of walki=
ng about I would=20

stand still at my study window, and, looking across the wide courtyard, ove=
r the pond and the bare=20

young birch-trees and the great fields covered with recently fallen, thawin=
g snow, I saw on a low=20

hill on the horizon a group of mud-coloured huts from which a black muddy r=
oad ran down in an=20

irregular streak through the white field. That was Pestrovo, concerning whi=
ch my anonymous=20

correspondent had written to me. If it had not been for the crows who, fore=
seeing rain or snowy=20

weather, floated cawing over the pond and the fields, and the tapping in th=
e carpenter's shed, this=20

bit of the world about which such a fuss was being made would have seemed l=
ike the Dead Sea; it=20

was all so still, motionless, lifeless, and dreary!  My uneasiness hindered=
 me from working and=20

concentrating myself; I did not know what it was, and chose to believe it w=
as disappointment. I had=20

actually given up my post in the Department of Ways and Communications, and=
 had come here=20

into the country expressly to live in peace and to devote myself to writing=
 on social questions. It=20

had long been my cherished dream. And now I had to say good-bye both to pea=
ce and to=20

literature, to give up everything and think only of the peasants. And that =
was inevitable, because I=20

was convinced that there was absolutely nobody in the district except me to=
 help the starving. The=20

people surrounding me were uneducated, unintellectual, callous, for the mos=
t part dishonest, or if=20

they were honest, they were unreasonable and unpractical like my wife, for =
instance. It was=20

impossible to rely on such people, it was impossible to leave the peasants =
to their fate, so that the=20

only thing left to do was to submit to necessity and see to setting the pea=
sants to rights myself.  I=20

began by making up my mind to give five thousand roubles to the assistance =
of the starving=20

peasants. And that did not decrease, but only aggravated my uneasiness. As =
I stood by the=20

window or walked about the rooms I was tormented by the question which had =
not occurred to me=20

before: how this money was to be spent. To have bread bought and to go from=
 hut to hut=20

distributing it was more than one man could do, to say nothing of the risk =
that in your haste you=20

might give twice as much to one who was well-fed or to one who was making m=
oney out of his=20

fellows as to the hungry. I had no faith in the local officials. All these =
district captains and tax=20

inspectors were young men, and I distrusted them as I do all young people o=
f today, who are=20

materialistic and without ideals. The District Zemstvo, the Peasant Courts,=
 and all the local=20

institutions, inspired in me not the slightest desire to appeal to them for=
 assistance. I knew that all=20

these institutions who were busily engaged in picking out plums from the Ze=
mstvo and the=20

Government pie had their mouths always wide open for a bite at any other pi=
e that might turn up.=20


_
lasts to a great age, because there is only a little air and fire in its na=
tural composition, a moderate=20

amount of moisture, and a great deal of the earthy. Hence its structure is =
of close texture and=20

solid, and so it cannot be injured by the weather or by the force of fire. =
 4. This may best be seen=20

from monuments in the neighbourhood of the town of Ferento which are made o=
f stone from these=20

The idea occurred to me to invite the neighbouring landowners and suggest t=
o them to organize in=20

my house something like a committee or a centre to which all subscriptions =
could be forwarded,=20

and from which assistance and instructions could be distributed throughout =
the district; such an=20

organization, which would render possible frequent consultations and free c=
ontrol on a big scale,=20

would=20


_
large statues exceedingly well made, images of smaller size, and flowers an=
d acanthus leaves=20

gracefully carved. Old as these are, they look as fresh as if they were onl=
y just finished. Bronze=20

workers, also, make moulds for the casting of bronze out of stone from thes=
e quarries, and find it=20

very useful in bronze-founding. If the quarries were only near Rome, all my=
 views. But I imagined=20

the lunches, the dinners, the suppers and the noise, the waste of time, the=
 verbosity and the bad=20

taste which that mixed provincial company would inevitably bring into my ho=
use, and I made haste=20

to reject my idea.  As for the members of my own household, the last thing =
I could look for was=20

help or support from them. Of my father's=20
