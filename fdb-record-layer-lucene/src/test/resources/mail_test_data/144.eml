mes. That is what they=20

would say in London, and she meant it was not to be made ducks and drakes o=
n.  I was a little=20

astonished, more especially when my associate boldly told her that, upon hi=
s honour, he would do=20

it for the money. Of course I could not there and then contradict him, and =
in effect say he was a=20

jolly humbug to let in a thrifty woman and her spouse in such a mode, so I =
held my peace until I=20

got him alone. Then I protested. He replied, "Oh, gammon! make the old boy =
and girl spend. They=20

won't do any good with their money if they don't drop it here; and, after a=
ll, rely upon it, I will make=20

them shell out three or five thousand pounds more if it is wanted." I argue=

associate was firm. He said, "We have gone too far into the matter to go ba=
ck. We shall both of us=20

be ruined in our professions if we run away from the stake. I say, that we =
must go in and win, and=20

make the old boy pay."  I have heard it said that "Necessity is the mother =
of invention." I believe=20

the proverb is familiar to most of my readers. I am going to supply another=
 illustration of it.  I was=20

 rest of the day. I felt=20

that we must go in and win, or we must not go in at all, but must run away.=
 Then my associate and=20

partner would stick by the candidate, and perhaps really succeed in doing a=
s he said must be=20

done--that was, gladden the hearts of the candidate and his wife by a trium=
ph at the poll, and get=20

the requisite amount of money to pay him for the operation. About the forme=
r part of the business I=20

was not at all certain; but if, on the other hand, he failed, which was mor=
e likely, could I rid myself=20

from the responsibility by merely withdrawing at the present stage of affai=
rs? I resolved to go on,=20

and make the best use of the little legal knowledge I had obtained, so as t=
o keep out of harm's=20

way. I was ultimately able to devise what I then thought, and still think, =

irit, so that the _ruse_=20

was, as the reader will see, entirely successful. As far as I could, of cou=
rse, I directly=20

superintended the details of my scheme.  Residing in the neighbourhood of S=
oho was a man of=20

considerable ability, who, as I was informed, and have now good reasons for=
 believing, could talk=20

and write with great ease and facility. What his political principles were =
I do not know, nor did I=20

then care about any more than he did himself. He was ready to accept the en=
gagement which I=20

offered him. For a price he agreed to become a third candidate for the repr=
esentation of N----.  My=20

man--the new candidate--and I, after quitting the lodgings of the former, w=
ent to an adjacent=20

nd paper, cigars, and a=20

bottle of wine, we concocted an address to "the free and independent electo=
rs" of the borough we=20

were to humbug. This was taken to a printer, who, for a little more than or=
dinary pay, got it into=20

type, and printed off five hundred copies within three hours.  We next paid=
 a visit to the shop of a=20

well-known clothes-dealer not far off, whose name has a flavour of Hebrew i=
n its orthography,=20

where our candidate got rigged out in admirable style; although at an expen=

little extravagant. When thus costumed in the habit of a gentleman, he real=

(such a sum as he had not been in the enjoyment of, I fancy, for a very lon=
