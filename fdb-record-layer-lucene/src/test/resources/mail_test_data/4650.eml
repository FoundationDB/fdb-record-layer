Verily God is my Lord and your Lord: therefore worship ye Him: this is a right way, _leading to 

Paradise_. But the sects have differed among themselves; _that is, the Christians have differed 

concerning Jesus, as to whether he be the son of God, or a deity with Him, or the third of three_. 

And woe unto them who have disbelieved _in that which hath been stated, or in other matters_, on 

account of the assembly of a great day, _the day of resurrection, and its terrors_. How will they 

hear, and how _will they_ world, historians can say no more of him than that he was a safe and 

conservative ruler, never achieving any marked success, and yet never incurring serious disaster. 

As a man he was cold, personally unattractive and unsympathetic, possessed of unquestioned 

physical courage, and yet at times fatally timid and irresolute; easily influenced,' especially by the 

one power which one might fancy most distasteful to Eleanor, the Church, for he was devout to the

her husband. But her blood was too hot for that; she was full of ambition and of energy and 

relentless determination to realize that ambition. As Queen of France there was no great role for 

her to play. She was young, and for the moment Louis and his counsellors governed France, while 

she was satisfied with less ambitious

will make connection with the troubadours of her native land, with whom her family and her ducal 

court of Bordeaux were traditionally associated. The exact dates of her friendship with various 

troubadours we do not, of course, know; but we do know that she made rather frequent trips to her 

beloved Bordeaux during these years, and that she was commonly recognized as a patroness of 

the troubadours.  We next hear of Eleanor in a role not altogether in keeping with her troubadour 

affiliations: one does not
