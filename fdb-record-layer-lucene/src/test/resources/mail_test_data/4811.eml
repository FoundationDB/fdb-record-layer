after." And, having thus given his decided opinion, Mr. Lowndes again took =
up his _Times_, and=20

wheeled his chair round to the fire.  "And O mamma!" exclaimed little Selin=
a, running forward from=20

a corner of the room in which she had been standing, a deeply interested sp=
ectator of all that had=20

passed, "Norah _could not_ have taken the  "Don't let's bother about them. =
You will be sending=20

me away soon, too, and I shall deserve it. Brute that I am. You were so tir=
ed, and I--"  "Oh, I'm=20

better now," I said. "Of course I must send you away by and by, but not qui=
te yet. First, I want to=20

ask if you weren't glad when you saw the jewels?"  "Jewels?" echoed Raoul. =
"What jewels?"  "You=20

don't mean to say you haven't yet opened the little bag I gave you at the t=
heatre?" I exclaimed.=20

Raoul looked half ashamed. "Dearest, don't think me ungrateful," he said, "=
but before I=20

," pleaded the eager=20

little witness, whose presence in the room had been until now forgotten by =
her mother. "When I=20

broke the tumbler, Martha said, 'Never mind, miss, you need say nothing abo=
ut it;' but Norah told=20

me never to hide anything from you, for it was always best to speak out the=
 truth boldly: and I did=20

what Norah said, and you were not very angry, mamma."  "I am never very ang=
ry except where=20

there is deceit and dishonesty," said the lady, fondly stroking back the li=
ght ringlets from the brow=20

of her darling.  "And you are sure that Norah did not take the money, mamma=
, for she _said_ that=20

she did not even see it."  "I am sure," answered the lady decidedly, "as su=
re of her innocence as I=20

am of your own." Bending her keen eyes on Martha, she continued, sternly, "=
You had better do=20

what you can to repair your fault by a frank confession."  "Indeed, indeed,=
 ma'am, but I never saw,=20

or touched, or thought of the sovereign; it's very hard that it should be p=
ut upon me," cried Martha,=20

bursting into passionate tears. "I was not the first to enter into that roo=
m; I don't see why _I_ am=20

suspected."  "And yet I cannot but feel suspicions so strong," said the lad=
y, "that I cannot retain in=20

me--that lie. It lit a fire in my brain. I forgot all about the bag, and ha=
ven't thought of it again till this=20

minute."  At last I laughed with sincerity. "Oh, Raoul, Raoul, you're not f=
it for this work-a-day world!=20

Well, I'm glad, after all, that I shall be with you, when you see what that=
 little insignificant bag=20

which you've forgotten all this tune has in it. Take it out of your pocket,=
 and let's open it together."=20

For the moment I was almost happy; and that Raoul would be happy, I knew.  =
His hand went to=20

the inner pocket of his coat, into which I had seen him put the brocade bag=
. But it did not come out=20

again. It groped; and his face flushed. "Good heavens, Maxine," he said, "I=
 hope you weren't in=20

for I've lost it. You=20

My knees seemed to give way under me. I half fell onto a sofa.  "Raoul," I =
said, in a queer stifled=20

voice, "the bag had in it the Duchess de Montpellier's diamonds."     IVOR =
