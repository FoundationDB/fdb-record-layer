Overland. Since all east-bound trains stopped at the coal-mines to coal the=
 engines, the way of=20

escape would be open.  Something more than a wordless, space-devouring half=
-hour beyond this,=20

Blount applied the brakes and dropped his passenger at the rear of the smal=
l iron-roofed building=20

which served as the railroad station for the coal-mines. Far to the rear on=
 the twenty-two-mile=20

 the western horizon.=20

"Go and blacken your face and hands at one of the slack dumps and pass your=
self for a miner=20

quitting his job," was Blount's parting suggestion; but the hollow-eyed fug=
itive had a last word to=20

say, too, and he said it.  "I've been t' hell and back, as I told you, and =
'twas f'r on'y th' wan thing:=20

give me your word, Evan Blount, that you'll chop th' damn' tree down and le=
t it lie where it falls!=20

That's all I'm askin', this trip."  "You needn't lose any sleep worrying ab=
out that," was the curt reply;=20

and without waiting for the train arrival, Blount turned the car and sent i=
t racing on the way back to=20

the city.  By all the tests he knew how to apply, he was little better than=

he pressed on, pushing=20
