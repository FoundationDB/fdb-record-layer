citizen Chauvelin?"  "Oh!" replied the other, "you know well enough what I mean--I am no fool, 

what?... or the Revolution would have no use for me. If after my many failures she still commands 

my services and employs me to keep my eyes and ears open, it is because she knows that she 

can count on me. I do keep my eyes and ears open, citizen Adet or Martin-Roget, whatever you 

like to call yourself, and also my mind--and I have a way of putting two and two together to make 

four. There are few people in Nantes who do not know that old Jean Adet, the miller, was hanged 

four years ago, because his son Pierre had taken part in some kind of open revolt against the 

tyranny of the ci-devant duc de Kernogan, and was not there to take his punishment himself. I 

knew old Jean Adet.... I was on the Place du Bouffay at Nantes when he was hanged...."  But 

already Martin-Roget had jumped to his feet with a muttered blasphemy.  "Have done, man," he 

said roughly, "have done!" And he started pacing up and down the narrow of perseverance, 

standing on three or four bundles of hay, and much coaxing--for the creature had evidently taken it 

into its head that the old woman had come there to fondle it--perhaps to feed it with sugar after the 

manner of Elspie.  She managed the thing at last, however, and led the horse up towards the 

house.  Now, while she had been thus engaged the family had left, and the half-breeds--having 

combined their forces--had arrived.  Ben Nevis was the first house the scoundrels came to. 

Dismounting, and finding the place deserted, they helped themselves to whatever was attractive 

and portable--especially to a large quantity of Canada twist tobacco, which old Duncan had found 

it impossible to carry away.  Then they applied fire to the mansion, and, in a wonderfully short time 

Ben Nevis was reduced to a level with the plain.  Another party treated Prairie Cottage in a similar 

manner.  It was when the first volume of black smoke rose into the sky that Old Peg came to the 

edge of the bushes that fringed the creek and discovered that Ben Nevis had suddenly become 

volcanic!  She instantly

throat and to squeeze the life out of him. "Think you," he added hoarsely, "that I need reminding of 

that?"  "No. I do not think that, citizen," replied Chauvelin calmly, "I only desired to warn you." 

"Warn me? Of what?"  Nervous, agitated, restless, Martin-Roget had once more gone back to his 

seat: his hands were trembling as he held them up mechanically to the blaze and his face was the 

colour of lead. aware of the state of matters, and rightly judged that the family must have escaped, 

else there would have been some evidence of resistance.  Fortunately the old woman had not yet 

passed quite from the shelter of the bushes.  She drew back with a degree of caution worthy of a 

Red-skin, leading the horse with her.  When well out of sight she paused for the purpose of 

meditation.  What was now to be done!  As we have said, she possessed decision of character in 

an eminent degree.  She never at any time
