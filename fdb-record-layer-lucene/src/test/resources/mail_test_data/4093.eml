philodendron monstera at Magnesia there is the temple of Diana by Hermogene=

at the corners, opposite the antae, it has two columns, and that it has arc=
hitraves not only in front,=20

as in the case of the temple in antis, but also one to the right and one to=
 the left in the wings. An=20

example of this is the temple of Jove and Faunus in the Island of the Tiber=
.  4. The amphiprostyle=20

is in all other respects like the prostyle, but has besides, in the rear, t=
he same arrangement of=20

columns and pediment.  5. A temple will be peripteral that has six columns =
in front and six in the=20

her back and shaking shoulders, I said:  "What a baby you are, Natalie! Fie=
, fie! Listen, Natalie:=20

when you realize how serious and responsible a business it is you will be t=
he first to thank me. I=20

assure you you will."  In my own room I set to work without haste. The exer=
cise books were not=20

bound, the pages were not numbered. The entries were put in all sorts of ha=
ndwritings; evidently=20

any one who liked had a hand in managing the books. In the record of the su=

there was no note of their money value. But, excuse me, I thought, the rye =

so constructed that in front and in the rear there are in each case eight c=

each side, including the corner columns. The walls of the cella in front an=

directly over against the four middle columns. Thus there will be a space, =
the width of two=20

intercolumniations plus the thickness of the lower diameter of a column, al=

walls and the rows of columns on the outside. There is no example of one ro=

Then, "Given to A. M. Sobol 32 roubles." When was it given? For what purpos=

Where was the receipt? There was nothing to show, and no making anything of=

proceedings, these papers would only obscure the case.  "How naive she is!"=
 I thought with=20

surprise. "What a child!"  I felt both vexed and amused.  V  My wife had al=

very good. The business=20

which had so worried and interested me was at last in my hands; I was doing=
 what the others=20

would not and could not do; I was doing my duty, organizing the relief fund=
 in a practical and=20

business-like way.  Everything seemed to be going in accordance with my des=
