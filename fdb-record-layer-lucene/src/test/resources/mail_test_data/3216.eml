"Is it possible," queries further on the author, thus answering the intimat=
e thought of every=20

Christian and Occultist who reads and studies his work:       Is it possibl=
e that the events of=20

humanity do run co-ordinately     with these number forms? If so, while Jes=
us Christ, as an=20

astronomical figure, was true to all that has been advanced, and     more, =
possibly, He may, as a=20

man, have filled up, under the     numbers, answers in the sea of life to p=
redestined type. The=20

personality of Jesus does not appear to have been destroyed,     because, _=
as a condition_, he=20

was answering to astronomical forms     and relations. The Arabian says, "Y=
our destiny is written=20

in the     stars."(254)   Nor is the "personality" of Apollonius "destroyed=
" for the same reason. The=20

case of Jesus covers the ground for the same possibility in the cases of al=
l Adepts and Avataras--

such as Buddha, Shankaracharya, Krishna, etc.--all of these as great and as=
 historical for their=20

respective followers and in their countries, as Jesus of Nazareth is now fo=
r Christians and in this=20

land.  But there is something more in the old literature of the early centu=
ries. Iamblichus wrote a=20

biography of the great Pythagoras.       The latter so closely resembles th=
e life of Jesus that it may=20

be     taken for a travesty. Diogenes Laertius and Plutarch relate the     =
history of Plato according=20

to a similar style.(255)   Why then wonder at the doubts that assail every =
scholar who studies all=20

these lives? The Church herself knew all these doubts in her early stages; =
and though only one of=20

her Popes has been known publicly and openly as a Pagan, how many more were=
 there who were=20

too ambitious to reveal the truth?  This "mystery," for mystery indeed it i=
s to those who, not being=20

Initiates, fail to find the key of the perfect similitude between the lives=
 of Pythagoras, Buddha,=20

Apollonius, etc.--is only a natural result for those who know that all thes=
e great characters were=20

Initiates of the same School. For them there is neither "travesty" nor "cop=
y" of one from the other;=20

for them they are all "originals," only painted to represent one and the sa=
me subject: the mystic,=20

and at the same time the public, life of the Initiates sent into the world =
to save portions of=20

humanity, if they could not save the whole bulk. Hence, the same programme =
for all. The assumed=20

"immaculate origin" for each, referring to their "mystic birth" during the =
Mystery of Initiation, and=20

accepted literally by the multitudes, encouraged in this by the better info=
rmed but ambitious clergy.=20

Thus, the mother of each one of them was declared a virgin, conceiving her =
son directly by the=20

Holy Spirit of God; and the Sons, in consequence, were the "Sons of God," t=
hough in truth, none=20

of them was any more entitled to such recognition than were the rest of his=
 brother Initiates, for=20

they were all--so far as their mystic lives were concerned--only "the epito=
misers of the history of=20

the same Sun," which epitome is another mystery within the Mystery. The bio=
graphies of the=20

external personalities bearing the names of such heroes have nothing to do =
with, and are quite=20

independent of the private lives of the heroes, being only the mystic recor=
ds of their public and,=20

parallel therewith, of their _inner_ lives, in their characters as Neophyte=
s and Initiates. Hence, the=20

manifest sameness of the means of construction of their respective biograph=
ies. From the=20

beginning of Humanity the Cross, or Man, with his arms stretched out horizo=
ntally, typifying his=20

kosmic origin, was connected with his psychic nature and with the struggles=
 which lead to=20

Initiation. But, if it is once shown that (_a_) every true Adept had, and s=
till has, to pass through the=20

seven and the twelve trials of Initiation, symbolised by the twelve labours=
 of Hercules; (_b_) that=20

the day of his real birth is regarded as that day when 106 N. Y., 298.  [33=
