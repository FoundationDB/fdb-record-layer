to be lighted in the=20

tranquil streets and to show at the windows. The evening was chilly, and Ri=
ntoul was cold with=20

agitation and anxiety. He felt more disconsolate than any Peri as he stood =
outside, and looking up=20

saw the windows all closed so carefully, the shutters barred, the curtains =
drawn. There was no=20

chance for him through these manifold mufflings, and he did not venture to =
go and ask for her,=20

though she was so necessary to him,--not only his love and his affianced wi=
fe, as he said to=20

himself, but his only confidant--the sole creature in the world to whom he =
dared to speak of that=20

which filled his mind and heart. It was with the most forlorn sense of aban=
donment and desolation=20

that he turned his face towards the house in which he was so important, and=
 so much love awaited=20

him, but where nobody knew even the A B C of his history. His only confidan=
t was offended Nora,=20

who had vowed to see him no more.     CHAPTER XLVI.   After this there ensu=
ed a brief pause in=20

the history of the family in all its branches: it was a pause ominous, sign=
ificant--like the momentary=20

hush before a storm, or the torrent's smoothness ere it dashes below. The h=
ouse of Lindores was=20

like a besieged stronghold, mined, and on the eve of explosion. Trains were=
 laid in all directions=20

under its doomed bastions, and the merest breath, a flash of lightning, a t=
ouch of electricity=20

anywhere, would be enough to bring down its defences in thunders of ruin. I=
t seemed to stand in a=20

silence that could be felt, throwing up its turrets against the dull sky--a=
 foreboding about it which=20

could not be shaken off. From every side assaults were preparing. The one s=
ole defender of the=20



stronghold felt all round him the storm which was brewing, but could not te=
ll when or how it was to=20

burst forth. Lord Lindores could scarcely have told whence it was that this=
 vague apprehension=20

came. Not from any doubt of Rintoul, surely, who had always shown himself f=
ull of sense, and=20

stood by him. Not from Edith--who had, indeed, been very rebellious, but ha=
d done her worst. And=20

of delicacy, not to frighten her--to go very softly; but Carry would be ame=
nable, as she had always=20

been. And thus he endeavoured to quiet the apprehensions within him.  There=
 was one thing,=20

however, which the whole family agreed upon, which was, in an uneasy sense,=
 that the presence=20

of Beaufort in their neighbourhood was undesirable. If they agreed in nothi=
ng else they agreed in=20

this. It was a shock to all of them to find that he had not departed with M=
illefleurs. Nothing could be=20

more decided than Rintoul was in this respect. So far as that went, he was =
evidently disposed to=20

take to the full the same view as his father. And Edith, though she had bee=
n so rebellious, was=20

perfectly orthodox here. It was not for some time after the departure of Mi=
llefleurs, indeed, that the=20

ladies made the discovery, not only that Beaufort was still at Dalrulzian, =
but that he had been at=20

Tinto. The latter fact had been concealed from Lord Lindores, but it added =
sadly to the=20

embarrassment and trouble of the others. They were all heavy with their sec=
rets--all holding back=20

something--afraid to divulge the separate course which each planned to take=
 for themselves. A=20

family will sometimes go on like this for a long time with the semblance of=
 natural union and=20



household completeness, while it has in reality dropped to pieces, and hold=
s together only out of=20

timidity or reluctance on the part of its members to burst the bonds of tra=
dition, of use and wont.=20

But on one point they were still united. Carry was the one subject upon whi=
ch all were on the alert,=20

and all agreed. Rintoul had no eyes for Edith's danger, and Edith--notwiths=
tanding many an=20

indication which would have been plain enough to her in other circumstances=
--never even=20

suspected him; but about Carry the uneasiness was general. "What is that fe=
llow doing hanging=20

about the place?--he's up to no good," Rintoul said, even in the midst of h=
is own overwhelming=20

embarrassments. "I wonder," was Lady Lindores's way of putting it--not with=
out a desire to make it=20

apparent that she disapproved of some one else--"I wonder how John Erskine,=
 knowing so much=20

as he does, can encourage Mr Beaufort to stay." "Mamma! how can you suppose=
 he encourages=20

him--can he turn him out of his house?" cried Edith, flaming up in instant =
defence of her lover, and=20

feeling her own guilt and hidden consciousness in every vein. There was no =
tender lingering now=20

upon Beaufort's name, no hesitation or slip into the familiar "Edward." As =
for Rintoul, he had been=20

providentially, as he felt, delivered from the necessity of speaking to his=
 father of his own=20

concerns, by being called away suddenly to the aid of a fellow officer in t=
rouble. It tore his heart,=20

indeed, to be out of reach of Nora; but as Nora would not see him, the loss=
 was less than it might=20

have been, and the delay a gain. Edith's story was in abeyance altogether; =

 neighbours--it was=20

decorous to refrain even from the very mild current of society in the count=
ry. And this, indeed, it=20

was which made the pause possible. Lord Lindores was the only member of the=
 family who carried=20

on his usual activities unbroken, or even stimulated by the various catastr=
ophes that had occurred.=20

He was more anxious than ever about the county hospitals and the election t=
hat must take place=20

next year; and he began to employ and turn to his own advantage the importa=
nt influence of the=20

Tinto estate, which he, as the little heir's grandfather, was certainly ent=
itled, he thought, to=20

consider as his own. Little Tommy was but four; and though, by a curious ov=
ersight, Lord Lindores=20

had not been named as a guardian, he was, of course, in the circumstances, =
his daughter's=20

natural guardian, who was Tommy's. This accession of power almost consoled =
