already filled to overflowing, I am counting on his loss as my gain; becaus=
e his happiness is=20

shipwrecked, I'm looking to get my share of the spoils! Out upon me for a s=
elfish, covetous fellow!"=20

exclaimed the indignant tar. "That same prosperous gale that I thought so m=
uch of seems to be=20

blowing me right on that sandbank of love of money, from which I've been wa=
rning others. I must=20

take care to sheer off myself!"  The road along which the school-master of =
Colme was passing, led=20

him by the cottage of Sands the clerk, and he glanced, as he went by, at th=
e untidy, weed-grown=20

garden, the window with the broken pane stuffed with rags, which told a sad=
 tale of sorrow and=20

neglect. The cottage was rather a large and good one, and a few years back =
had worn an=20

appearance of comfort and prosperity, such as befitted the home of the resp=
ectable Clerk of=20

Colme. Franks remembered the lines stretched out along the garden, whitened=
 with linen hung out=20

to dry; for Nancy Sands, a strong and active woman, had added many a pound =
to her husband's=20

gains by her skill in laundry-work. Now one of the poles lay rotting on the=
 ground; a broken, dirty=20

cord, hanging loose from the wall, was all that remained of the lines. Fami=
lies no longer cared to=20

trust Nancy Sands with their washing, and, if report spoke truth, the poor =
clerk had sometimes to=20

iron his own shirts himself, to keep up the decent appearance indispensable=
 to one in his station.=20

Ned Franks had not gone many yards past the dwelling of Sands, when he saw =
before him the=20

poor man himself, advancing slowly, as if there were little to attract him =
towards his home. The=20

figure of the Clerk of Colme, by its peculiar stiffness and formality, was =
easily recognized at a=20

distance. He always dressed in black, and so appropriate did the cloth appe=
ar to the wearer, that=20

no one could imagine John Sands appearing in any less grave attire. Even in=
 his best days the=20

Clerk of Colme had seemed as if he could never look happy. The closely crop=
ped hair, black and=20

almost as thick as the fur of a beaver, was seen above a thin, sallow face,=
 always so solemn and=20

serious that it was supposed to be incapable of smiling. There had been som=
e thought, years=20

before the beginning of this story, of appointing John Sands as school-mast=
er at Colme; but there=20

was not one of the scholars who would not have regarded such an appointment=
 with exceeding=20

dislike and disgust. The boys were certain that the old raven, as they call=
ed the clerk, must have=20

been brought up in an undertaker's shop, and been cradled in a coffin; they=
 believed that he had=20

never laughed when a baby, nor played at cricket or football when a boy; in=
deed, a doubt was=20

expressed as to whether the clerk had ever been a boy at all, but had not r=
ather grown out of a=20

Liliputian man, clad in a tiny black coat, and miniature white neck-cloth. =
No one was very intimate=20

with John Sands; no one ever addressed him by his Christian name, or though=
t of clapping him on=20

the shoulder, or telling him a bit of good news, or asking him to "come and=
 share pot-luck." Yet=20

nothing could be said against the clerk, except that he did not rule his ow=
n house well, and was=20

thought to be henpecked by Nancy.  When the sailor (for such Franks still c=
onsidered himself, and=20

was considered by other to be, though he had not been afloat for years) saw=
 John Sands coming=20

towards him, he had something of a feeling of shame; it seemed to his kindl=
y, honest nature as if=20

he had done his neighbor wrong by even thinking of taking his place. Franks=
 lifted his cap with a=20

courteous "Good-day," as he was about to pass John Sands, but the clerk sto=
od stock-still on the=20

path, and clearly did not wish to be passed.  "Mr. Franks," he said, to the=
 sailor, "if you could spare=20

me a few minutes, I should like to have a quiet talk with you. The church i=
s hard by; will you come=20

with me into the vestry?"  Now Franks was in great haste to get home; he wa=
s impatient to tell his=20

wife of his wondrous success with Bat Bell; besides, having given away his =
breakfast, he was=20



exceedingly hungry; for, having risen at four o'clock that morning, and hav=
ing eaten nothing since=20

an early breakfast, his sharp appetite reminded him that it was long past h=
is usual dinner-time.=20

Franks had calculated on having just a quarter of an hour in which to satis=
fy hunger, and tell all his=20

news, before his pupils would gather again for afternoon lessons. Had John =
Sands not been in=20

treaty. I had brought with me from London a loaded revolver, warned by the =
Foreign Secretary that=20

to do so would be a wise precaution; and I was ready to make use of it if n=
ecessary.  I was=20

beginning to be very hungry, but that was a detail of no importance, for I =
had no time to waste in=20

eating. I went to the railway-station and looked about until I found a port=
er whose face I had seen=20

when I got out of the train. He had, in fact, appeared under the window of =
my compartment,=20

offering himself as a luggage carrier and had been close behind me when my =
late travelling=20

companion walked by my side. Questioned, he appeared not to remember; but h=
is wits being=20

sharpened by the gift of a franc, he reflected and recalled not only my fea=
tures but the features of=20

the little man, whom he described with sufficient accuracy. What had become=
 of _le petit=20

Monsieur_ he was not certain, but fancied he had eventually driven away in =
a cab accompanied by=20

two other gentlemen. He recollected this circumstance, because the face of =
the cabman was one=20

that he knew; and it was now again in the station, for the _voiture_ had re=
turned. Would he point=20

out the _cocher_ to me? He would, and did, receiving a second franc for his=
 pains.  The cab driver=20

proved to be a dull and surly fellow, like many another _cocher_ of Paris, =
but the clink of silver and=20

the sight of it mellowed him. I began by saying that I was in search of thr=
ee friends of mine whom I=20

was to have met when the boat train came in, but whom I had unfortunately m=
issed. I asked him to=20

describe the men he had driven away from the station at that time, and thou=
gh he did it clumsily,=20

betraying an irritating lack of observation when it came to details, still =
such information as I could=20

draw from him sounded encouraging. He remembered perfectly well the place a=
t which he had=20

deposited his three passengers, and I decided to take the risk of following=
 them.  When I say=20

"risk," I mean the risk that the man I was starting to chase might turn out=
 not to be the man I=20

wished to follow. Besides, as they had been driven to Neuilly, the distance=
 was so great that, if I=20

went there in a cab, and found at last that I had made a mistake, I should =
have wasted a great=20

deal of valuable time on the wrong tack. If the driver had remembered the n=
ame of the street, and=20

the number of the house at which he had paused, I would have hired a motor =
and flashed out to=20

the place in a few minutes; but, despite a suggested bribe, he could say no=
 more than that, when=20

he had come to a certain place, one of his passengers had called, "Turn dow=
n the next street, to=20

the left." He had done so, and in front of a house, almost midway along tha=
t street, he had been=20

bidden to stop. He had not bothered to look at the name of the street; but,=
 though he was not very=20

familiar with that neighbourhood, various landmarks would guide him to the =
right place, when he=20

came to pass them again.  Having heard all he had to say, I reluctantly mad=
e up my mind that I=20

could do no better than take the man as my conductor; and accordingly, with=
 a horse already tired,=20

I drove to Neuilly. There, the landmarks were not deceiving, as I was half =
afraid they would be;=20

and in a quiet street of the suburb, we stopped at last before a fair-sized=
 house with lights in many=20

windows. Evidently it was a _pension_.  Of the man-servant who answered my =
ring, I enquired if=20

three English gentlemen had lately arrived. He replied that they had, and w=
ere dining. Would=20

Monsieur give himself the pain of waiting a few minutes, until dinner shoul=
d be over?  My answer=20

was to slip a five franc piece into the servant's hand, and suggest that I =
should be shown at once=20



into the dining-room, without waiting.  My idea was to catch my birds while=
 they fed, and take them=20

by surprise, lest they fly away. If I pounced upon them in the midst of a m=
eal, at least they could=20

not escape before being recognised by me: and as to what should come after =
recognition, the=20

moment of meeting must decide.  The five franc piece worked like a charm. I=
 was promptly=20

ushered into the dining-room, and standing just inside the door, I swept th=
e long table with a quick,=20

eager glance. About eighteen or twenty people were dining, but, though seve=
ral were=20

unmistakably English, I saw no one who resembled my travelling companions. =
 Everyone turned=20

and stared. There was no face of which I had not a good view. In a low voic=
e I asked the servant=20

which were=20


_
quiet talk; but the sailor was sorry for Nancy's husband, and only reminded=
 the clerk that lessons=20

would begin again at two, and that the school-master must be at his post.  =
Franks doubted=20

whether Sands had even noticed this hint. The clerk turned back, and, at a =
slower pace than was=20

pleasant to his hungry companion, proceeded towards the village church, not=
 uttering a single=20

word as he went. The two passed along the little walk which led to the back=
 door which opened=20

into the vestry. The clerk very slowly, at least so it seemed to Franks, dr=
ew the large key out of his=20

pocket, and fitted it into the lock. The creaking door was opened, and the =
two men entered the=20

little room which looked so neat, solemn, and silent, with the light from t=
he diamond-paned window=20

falling on its green cloth-covered table, with the heavy desk, and the big =
registry book upon it. It is=20

probable that the clerk felt more at home in this place than in his own che=
erless dwelling; here at=20

least there was peace.  There were in the mind of Ned Franks very pleasant =
recollections=20

connected with that vestry-room. The very chair which he now took had been =
occupied by his=20

bride, when, for the last time, she had signed herself "Persis whom he had =
spoken. He pointed=20

them out, and added that, though they had come only that day from England, =
they were old=20

patrons, well known in the house.  As I lingered, deeply disappointed, the =
elderly proprietor of the=20

_pension_, who superintended the comfort of his guests, trotted fussily up =
to enquire the=20

stranger's business in his dining-room. I explained that I had hoped to fin=
d friends, and was so=20

polite that I contrived to get permission for my cabman to have a peep thro=
ugh the crack of the=20

door. When he had identified his three passengers, all hope was over. I had=
 followed the wrong=20

men.  There was nothing to do but go back to the Gare du Nord, and question=
 more porters and=20

cabmen. Nobody could give me any information worth having, it seemed; yet t=
he little man must=20

have left the station in a vehicle of some sort, as he had a great deal of =
small luggage. Since I=20

could learn nothing of him or his movements, however, and dared not, becaus=
e of Maxine and the=20

British Foreign Secretary, apply to the police for help, I determined to lo=
se no more time before=20

consulting a private detective, a man whose actions I could control, and to=
 whom I need tell only=20

as much of the truth as I chose, without fear=20


_
and there, but two days ago, their first-born babe had been registered as r=
eceived by baptism into=20

the church. The clerk also seemed to have the latter event in his mind; for=
, as he seated himself=20

under the window, with his back to the light, he observed, in the slow, mea=
sured tone which he=20

always used, "Your child was christened in this church on last Saturday, Mr=
. Franks."  "If that is all=20

he has to say to me," thought the half-famished sailor, "I need scarcely ha=
ve lost my dinner for it;"=20

but he waited, with what patience he could command, for the next slow sente=
nce which might drop=20

from the lips of John Sands.  These two men, who had once been rival aspira=
nts for the post of=20

school-master at Colme, formed a singular contrast to each other,--Sands, w=
ith that primly-cut=20

hair, which lay like a judge's black cap on his head, and his face as grave=
 as if he were that judge=20

pronouncing sentence; Franks, with light brown locks, which seemed to curl =
themselves round=20

with very good-humor, and bright blue eyes, always ready to sparkle with fu=
n, as well as to beam=20

with kindness. No one could wonder at the preference felt by the boys for t=
he one-armed sailor,=20

though he had not half the learning of Sands. We know that _he that hath a =
merry heart hath a=20

continual feast_; and where such a heart dragged out of me.  At my own hote=
l I enquired of the=20

manager where I could find a good private detective, got an address, and mo=
tored to it, the speed=20

bracing my nerves. Fortunately, (as I thought then) Monsieur Anatole Girard=
 was at home and able=20

to receive me. I was shown into the plain but very neat little sitting-room=
 of a flat on the fifth floor of=20

a big new apartment house, and was impressed at first glance by the clever =
face of the dark, thin=20

Frenchman who politely bade me welcome. It was cunning, as well as clever, =
no doubt: but then, I=20

told myself, it was the business of a person in Monsieur Girard's professio=
n to be cunning.  I=20

introduced myself as Mr. Sanford, the name I had been told to give at the E=
lysee Palace Hotel.=20

This seemed best, as it was in the hotel that I had been recommended to Mon=
sieur Girard, and=20

complications might arise if George Sandford suddenly turned into Ivor Dund=
as. Besides, as there=20

were a good many things which I did not want brought to light, Sandford see=
med the man to fit the=20

situation. Later, he could easily disappear and leave no trace.  I said tha=
t I had been robbed of a=20

thing which was of immense value to me, but as it was the gift of a lady wh=
ose name must not on=20

any account appear in the case, I did not wish to consult the police. All I=
=20
