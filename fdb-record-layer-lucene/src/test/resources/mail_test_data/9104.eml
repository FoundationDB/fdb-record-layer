Tell me who he is then--since you know him--so that I may duly beware of hi=

tell you who he fire-raisin' cut-throats.  It iss the fortune of war--whate=

"Carry away whatever you like," replied Grant, quietly, "only be off at onc=

 is there where you least expect him under a disguise you would scarcely dr=

I will not tell you who he fire-raisin' cut-throats.  It iss the fortune of=
 war--whatever, and we can't affoord to leave our weemen an' bairns defence=
less.  So we accept your terms, if we are not hindered from carryin' away o=
ur arms."  "Carry away whatever you like," replied Grant, quietly, "only be=
 off at once, or I'll _
given his life and a safe conduct into Spain on the condition that he gave =
me--Martin-Roget--letters=20

of personal introduction to various high-born _emigres_ in Holland, in Germ=
any and in England.=20

Armed with these I am invulnerable. I have been presented to His Royal High=
ness the Regent,=20

and to the elite of English society in Bath. I am the friend of M. le duc d=
e Kernogan now and the=20

accredited suitor for his daughter's hand."  "His daughter!" broke in Chauv=
elin with a sneer, and=20

his pale, keen eyes had in them a spark of malicious mockery.  Martin-Roget=
 made no immediate=20

retort to the sneer. A curious hot flush had spread over his forehead and h=
is ears, leaving his=20

cheeks wan and livid.  "What about the daughter?" reiterated Chauvelin.  "Y=
vonne de Kernogan=20

has never seen Pierre Adet the miller's son," replied the other curtly. "Sh=
e is now the affianced=20

wife of Martin-Roget the millionaire banker of Brest. To-night I shall pers=
uade M. le duc to allow=20

my marriage with his daughter to take place within the week. I shall plead =
pressing business in=20

Holland and my desire that my wife shall accompany me thither. The duke wil=
l consent and=20

Yvonne de Kernogan will not be consulted. The day after my wedding I shall =
be on board the=20

_Hollandia_ with my wife and father-in-law, and together we will be on our =
way to Nantes where=20

Carrier will deal with them both."  "You are quite satisfied that this plan=
 of yours is known to no=20

one, that no one at the present moment is aware of the fact that Pierre Ade=
t, the miller's son, and=20

Martin-Roget, banker of Brest, are one and the same?"  "Quite satisfied," r=
eplied Martin-Roget=20

emphatically.  "Very well, then, let me tell you this, citizen," rejoined C=
hauvelin slowly and=20

deliberately, "that in spite of what you say I am as convinced as that I am=
 here, alive, that your real=20

identity will be known--if it is not known already--to a gentleman who is a=
t this present moment in=20

Bath, and who is known to you, to me, to the whole of France as the Scarlet=
 surprisingly, so that it=20

not only broke into a gallop, but set off at racing speed as it used to do =
when young.  The Indian=20

was badly mounted, and gradually lost ground, whereupon he sent after the f=
ugitives several more=20

arrows which all fell wide of the mark.  The change to Old Peg was as a rep=
rieve from death!  The=20

trot had almost dislocated her bones, and shaken her up like an addled egg,=
 and the change to=20

racing speed afforded infinite relief.  She could scarcely credit her sense=
s, and she felt a tendency=20

to laugh again as she glanced over her shoulder.  But that glance removed t=
he tendency, for it=20

revealed the Indian warrior, in all his paint and feathers and streaming sc=
alp-locks, in hot pursuit,=20

while the whiz of another arrow close past her ear convinced our heroine th=
at it was not a dream.=20

The jolting to which the poor old creature was subjected had disturbed her =
costume not a little.=20

Her shawl came nearly off, and, holding on by one pin, fluttered like a fla=
g of defiance.  Her=20

slippers, which were of the carpet pattern, were left behind on the prairie=
 to perplex the wolves,=20

and her voluminous hair--once a rich auburn, but now a pearly grey--having =
escaped its cap and=20

fastenings, was streaming out gaily in the breeze, as if to tempt the finge=
rs and knife of the=20

pursuer.  A stern-chase is a long one, whether ashore or afloat.  Pursuer a=
nd pursued went rapidly=20

down the Settlement until they came in sight of the band which had come to =
rescue Peg.  They=20

received her with a wild cheer of surprise and joy, which turned the Red-sk=
in to the right-about,=20

and sent him back to his friends much faster than he had come.  On receivin=
g his report, the half-

breeds at once dashed off in pursuit of the settlers, and did not draw rein=
 until they reached the=20

place where the Scotchmen had made a stand.  The latter were greatly outnum=
bered, at least in=20

fighting men, but they showed such a resolute front, that Cuthbert Grant, t=
he half-breed leader,=20

again interfered to prevent bloodshed if=20


_
Martin-Roget laughed and shrugged his shoulders.  "Impossible!" he retorted=
. "Pierre Adet no=20

longer exists ... he never existed ... much.... Anyhow, he ceased to be on =
that stormy day in=20

September, 1789. Unless your pet enemy is a wizard he cannot know."  "There=
 is nothing that my=20

pet enemy--as you call him--cannot ferret out if he has a mind to. Beware o=
f him, citizen Martin-

Roget. Beware, I tell you."  "How can I," laughed the other contemptuously,=
 "if I don't know who he=20

is?"  "If you did," retorted Chauvelin, "it wouldn't help you ... much. But=
 beware of every man you=20

don't know; beware of every forbearance, he turned to Duncan McKay senior, =
who was the=20

settlers' spokesman, and said--  "If you will go peaceably away out of the =
colony, we will spare=20

you, but if you show fight your blood be on your own heads, for I cannot re=
strain my men much=20

longer."  "Iss it sparin' us you will be talkin' of, Cuthbert Grant?" answe=
red the Highlander, with=20

scorn.  "Wow! but if it wass not for the weemen an' children that's with us=
, you would hev a goot=20

chance o' bein' in need o' sparin' yoursels; an' it iss not much o' the blo=
od o' the Grants, either,=20

that's in _your_ veins, or ye would scorn to consort wi' such=20
