the ground the money which Captain Kidd had supplied him for his own needs,=
 and as=20

compensation for his services until his return. The axes and shovels, also,=
 were secreted in the=20

woods.  It was past midnight when they returned to the ship, which set sail=
 at break of day towards=20

the north. By sunset they reached Albemarle Sound, the rendezvous of some c=
ompanion=20

buccaneers; and there waited for several days feasting and engaging in jovi=
al pastimes.=20

Meantime, a small sloop was procured for Captain Redfield; and, having been=
 supplied with=20

necessary provisions and household comforts, and manned by four sturdy men =
who knew naught=20

of the buried treasure, but engaged for the service on goodly pay, it saile=
d for the captain's new=20

home near Money Island.  Upon reaching their destination, the pioneer resid=
ents set to work at=20

once to construct temporary quarters, and were soon provided with a comfort=
able house.=20

According to the plans of the Commander-in-Chief, the men who accompanied C=
aptain Redfield=20

were to understand that they were to engage in any service that might come =
to hand. They were to=20

clear the land and till it, build houses and fences, and do such other work=
 as might tend to prepare=20

the locality for a more permanent settlement in case it should be desired t=
o inaugurate such an=20

enterprise.  The sloop gave them communication with the outside world, enab=
ling them to visit=20

Charleston, where a colony had been lately planted, and the several settlem=
ents to the north. It=20

also afforded Captain Redfield opportunity to find a wife, whom he brought =
to Rindout, as he styled=20

his new home. There the party lived in the quiet enjoyment of a life with n=
ature, which abundantly=20

supplied, during the frequent periods of recreation, every facility for hun=
ting, fishing, and other=20

sports.  One year passed, and another reached its seventh month; and the pa=
rty had experienced=20

nothing to arouse more than a passing interest. There had been no visitors =
to their settlement, not=20

even an Indian.  On one October morning, however, a ship was seen  But this=
 was a notable=20

discovery; and it set her quick and fertile brain working in a hundred diff=
erent ways; but mostly she=20

bethought her of one John C. Huysen and of a certain newspaper-office on Fi=
fth Avenue, Chicago,=20

111.  'Well, there,' she said to herself, as the result of these rapid cogi=
tations, 'if Jack Huysen's=20

good for anything--if he wants to say he has done me a service--if he wants=
 to show he has the=20

spirit of a man in him--well, _now's his chance_.'                         =
         *CHAPTER II.*=20

*CONFESSIONS.*   It was but another instance of the curiously magnetic infl=
uence of this man's=20

personality that she instantly and unhesitatingly assumed that what he wrot=
e must be of value.=20

Now every second human being, as well she knew, writes verses at one period=
 of his life, and=20

these are mostly trash; and remain discreetly hidden, or are mercifully bur=
ned. But what Ronald=20

wrote, she was already certain, must be characteristic of himself, and have=
 interest and definite=20

worth; and what better could she do than get hold of some of these things, =
and have them=20

introduced to the public, perhaps with some little preliminary encomium wri=
tten by a friendly hand?=20

She had heard from the little Maggie that Ronald had never sent any of his =
writings to the=20

newspapers; might not this be a service?  She could not offer him a soverei=
gn because he=20

happened to be in the boat when she caught her first salmon; but fame--the =
appeal to the wide-

reading public--the glory of print?  Nay, might they not be of some commerc=
ial value also?  She=20

knew but little of the customs of the Chicago journals, but she guessed tha=
t a roundabout hint=20

conveyed to Mr. John C. Huysen would not be without effect.  And what were =
the subjects, she=20

asked herself, that Ronald wrote about? In praise of deerstalking, for one =
thing, and mountain-

climbing, and out-of-door life, she felt assured: you could see it in his g=
ait and in his look; you=20



could hear it in his laugh and his singing as he went along the road.  Poli=
tics,=20


_
This was a sight which caused a considerable stir among them. Captain Redfi=
eld debated the=20

question within himself whether or not it was the ship of the Commander-in-=
Chief, and if it would=20

be wise to go out and pay her a visit. But he hesitated, not wishing to jeo=
pardize the commission=20

imposed upon him.  Finally, a boat was seen approaching the shore, bearing =
a flag at its prow. In=20

due course this was recognized as the ensign of Captain Kidd; and everythin=
g wag hastily=20

arranged to receive the leader with due honor and welcome.  As the boat dre=
w near, though, it=20

was discovered that he was not among the occupants; but on a seat at the st=
ern, and with=20

dignified mien, sat Max Brisbau, an old shipmate of Captain Redfield's, and=
 a former companion in=20

the service of Captain Kidd.  Brisbau alighted, and, extending his hand to =
Captain Redfield with=20

suave complacency, stated that he had came upon a little service for Captai=
n Kidd, and would=20

later savour running through his talk; and he took abundant interest in pub=
lic affairs.  Or perhaps=20

he would be for recording the charms of some rustic maiden--some 'Jessie, t=
he Flower o'=20

Dumblane'--some blue-eyed and rather silent and uninteresting young person,=
 living alone in a=20

glen, and tending cattle or hanging out things to dry on a hedge?  Well, ev=
en a song would be=20

something.  The _Chicago Citizen_ might not pay very much for it, but the g=
reat and generous=20

public might take kindly to it; and if Jack Huysen did not say something fr=
iendly about it, then she=20

would know the reason why.  But the stiffest struggle Miss Carry ever had w=
ith any salmon was=20

mere child's play compared with the fight she had with Ronald himself over =
this matter.  At first he=20

was exceedingly angry that she should have been told; but then he laughed, =
and said to her that=20

there were plenty of folk in Scotland as elsewhere who wrote idle verses, b=
ut that they had the=20

common=20
