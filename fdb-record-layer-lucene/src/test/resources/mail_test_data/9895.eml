Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael=
 S. Hart was the=20

originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a writing to the Czar to =
arrange a plan for an=20

offensive campaign, the French had advanced upon the British and Prussian c=
antonments, and=20

the firing had begun. Wellington=E2=80=99s letter was dated the 15th of Jun=
e, and by the evening of the=20

18th--one of the most momentous days in the world=E2=80=99s history--Napole=
on was a ruined and=20

despairing fugitive.  It was only natural if, after the first outburst of e=
xulting joy at the overthrow of=20

the common enemy, the Russians remembered Moscow and the glories of the Ger=
man=20

campaigns, and said sadly each to the other, =E2=80=9CAh, why were not we t=
here?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI do not grudge the=20

English their laurels,=E2=80=9D said the captain of the Chevalier Guard. =
=E2=80=9CThey are a gallant race, and have=20

been true throughout to the cause of Europe and of freedom. But why were no=
t _we_ at hand,=20

instead of Blucher and those Prussians, to stand by them breast to breast?=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe can only say,=20

captain, it was the will of God,=E2=80=9D answered Ivan. =E2=80=9CHe sent t=
he English and the Prussians to Belgium,=20

and kept us here. He knows--and all the world knows too--that the Czar was =
as ready for the work=20

as Wellington or Blucher, and would have done it quite as well.=E2=80=9D  T=
he Czar himself recognized in=20

this event the hand of God, and was satisfied. He had learned a lesson perh=
aps more difficult than=20

that of being ready to do any work required of him--he was =E2=80=9Cready _=
not_ to do.=E2=80=9D Without an=20

afterthought of jealousy he saw the work he had begun completed by another,=
 to whom was given=20

the crowning glory of dealing the fatal blow to the enemy _he_ had first gr=
appled with and=20

overthrown. The heart-felt joy with which he gave thanks for the victory of=
 Waterloo was deepened=20

by the thought that the blood of his Russians, shed so freely before in the=
 cause of Europe, had=20

now been mercifully spared.  Three weeks afterwards the allied sovereigns e=
ntered Paris once=20

more, and Louis Dix-huit returned in their wake. A second time had the way =
to his capital been=20

made safe for him by his =E2=80=9Cdear friends the enemies,=E2=80=9D as he =
sarcastically and ungratefully styled his=20

deliverers.  The Chevalier Guard attended their imperial master, and Ivan h=
ad the intense joy of a=20

reunion with his young bride. His return was far more speedy than they had =
either of them dared to=20

hope, and their hearts were filled with thankfulness. Madame de Salgues had=
 removed from=20

Versailles into the city, where she had taken a small house in a fashionabl=
e quarter, and Ivan=20

obtained permission to reside with his friends.  Many things had happened d=
uring his absence; he=20



had much to hear as well as to tell. The =E2=80=9CHundred Days=E2=80=9D had=
 left their impress upon all the=20

household. Madame de Salgues told him she had come to Paris as much from a =
determination to=20

defy =E2=80=9CGeneral Buonaparte=E2=80=9D as from a sense of the insecurity=
 of a town like Versailles in such=20

troublous times. Henri, strange to say, had reaped advantage from the gener=
al confusion. When=20

the power of Napoleon was re-established, Madame de Talmont deplored that t=
he army, as a=20

career for her son, was of course out of the question; and Henri thought th=
is a favourable moment=20

for broaching the ideas he had already uttered in confidence to Ivan. They =
were received much=20

better than he had ventured to expect; and he was now, with his mother=E2=
=80=99s consent, studying under=20

a celebrated architect. =E2=80=9COne must sometimes sacrifice one=E2=80=99s=
 feelings,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9Cthough _never_=20

one=E2=80=99s principles. And, after all, what to do? The army is no longer=
 a place for a man of honour; the=20

bar you do not like; and to the Church there is at least one objection,--I =
do not wish the noble=20

name of Talmont to die with you.=E2=80=9D  Emile was now a resident under t=
he roof of his grandmother; he=20

had ceased to wear the uniform of the Ecole Polytechnique. With a few other=
 students who made=20

their imperialism very obtrusive during the Hundred Days, he had the honour=
 of sharing in the=20

downfall of his hero by being expelled at the return of the Bourbons. This =
ended not only his=20

military and scientific education, but, at least for the present, his hopes=
 of obtaining a commission.=20

A day or two after his arrival, Ivan inquired for M. de Sartines and his da=
ughter, whom he had not=20

yet seen.  =E2=80=9CNo doubt they will be here to-morrow,=E2=80=9D Madame d=
e Salgues answered. =E2=80=9CThey know you=20

are with us. Besides, we are their near neighbours now, and they seldom lea=
ve us three days=20

without a visit.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWish they would leave us three weeks!=
=E2=80=9D said Emile. =E2=80=9CThat little girl is a perfect=20

nuisance.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy dear boy, how very ungallant you are!=E2=80=
=9D Madame de Salgues observed. =E2=80=9CStill,=E2=80=9D she=20

added, =E2=80=9CI must own that Mademoiselle St=C3=A9phanie is not by any m=
eans improved.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot altogether=20

_her_ fault, poor child!=E2=80=9D put in Cl=C3=A9mence.  =E2=80=9COh, _you_=
 always speak for her, ma cousine, because=20

she is like your shadow,=E2=80=9D said Emile. =E2=80=9CThree mornings in th=
e week, at least, Prince Ivan, she=20

comes here. =E2=80=98Papa,=E2=80=99 she says,=E2=80=9D and the lad imitated=

speeches; and that, to a child, is absolute cruelty.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWho=
 _did_ encourage them during the=20

Hundred Days, you mean to say,=E2=80=9D Emile resumed. =E2=80=9CWhile the E=
mperor was in power, you were all=20

of you glad to hear, even from the lips of a child, whom no one could punis=
h or seriously blame,=20

the impertinences the grown-up Legitimists were longing to utter, but dared=
 not.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CSome of us,=E2=80=9D=20

said Madame de Salgues with dignity, =E2=80=9Cnever condescended to conceal=
 our opinions. You will do=20

me the justice to remember, Emile, that I gave to every one, as my chief re=
ason for coming into=20

Paris, my desire to show the usurper I was not afraid of him.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CAs if the Emperor--=E2=80=9D Emile began=20

indignantly, but fortunately checked himself in time, and turned off his an=
noyance with a laugh.=20

=E2=80=9CYou forget, my dear grandmother,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cthat t=
here was another reason yet more potent. The=20

truth is, Prince Ivan, we came into town to avoid that poor M. de Cranfort.=
 Since the auspicious=20

morning when my cousin became Madame la Princesse, the unfortunate gentlema=
n has not been=20

quite in possession of his senses. It is reported that he carries two loade=
d pistols about with him,=20

and threatens to shoot first Cl=C3=A9mence and then himself.=E2=80=9D  Ever=
y one present laughed heartily,=20

assuring Ivan there was not a word of truth in the story.  =E2=80=9CAs much=
, I suppose,=E2=80=9D said Ivan in a low=20

voice to Emile, =E2=80=9Cas in another story you told me once--about M. de =
Sartines.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am glad enough=20

now _that_ was false,=E2=80=9D Emile answered graciously. =E2=80=9CThat chi=
ld would have been the death of=20

Cl=C3=A9mence. I hope M. de Sartines, if he does marry, will marry a dragon=
, able to keep her in order.=20

But really,=E2=80=9D he added, =E2=80=9CM. de Cranfort is not quite sane. I=
 have heard him say the most=20

extraordinary things; and, do you know, he was for some years at Charenton?=
=E2=80=9D After a short=20

pause, he resumed suddenly--=E2=80=9CPrince Ivan, how is the Emperor Alexan=
der?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIn excellent health,=E2=80=9D=20

said Ivan cheerfully.  =E2=80=9CI am truly rejoiced to hear it.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CVery kind of you,=E2=80=9D returned Ivan smiling, but=20

with a slight air of surprise at his emphatic manner.  =E2=80=9CBecause,=E2=
=80=9D resumed Emile, in a tone of=20

mystery, =E2=80=9Cas we are all friends here, I may observe that we have he=
ard rumours--extraordinary=20

rumours.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDo you mean about his illness at Vienna? It is =
true he had a fall from his horse, and--=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9COh, _that_ is nothing. That is not what I mean. But the strangest =
things are said of him here, and=20

sorts of =E2=80=98_on dits_=E2=80=99 are rife about him. People say he has =
become very singular,--a fanatic, a=20

pietist, and I know not what else; that a certain crazy old lady--=E2=80=9D=

Madame de Salgues and Madame de Talmont almost at the same moment. Cl=C3=A9=

anxiously at Ivan, and Henri started up indignantly. =E2=80=9CI, at least, =
will not stay to listen to such folly,=E2=80=9D=20

he said.  =E2=80=9CA truce, for once, to your championship of the Czar,=E2=
=80=9D said Emile. =E2=80=9CI suppose Prince Ivan=20

may speak now.=E2=80=9D  Ivan might have answered angrily, but for certain =
words which thrilled through=20

his heart, taking all the bitterness out of Emile=E2=80=99s reckless taunts=

that Madame de Krudener=20

makes the Emperor Alexander fast and wear sackcloth; or that she has persua=
ded him he is the=20



white angel of peace, and Napoleon the black demon of war; or that--but, as=
 I say, these may be=20

foolish stories. Still it seems to be undeniable that the consummate artist=
