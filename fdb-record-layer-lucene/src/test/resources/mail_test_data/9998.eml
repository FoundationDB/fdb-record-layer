CHAPTER VI  DODGING A MAGNATE AND WHAT CAME OF IT  Next morning, good commu=
ter=20

that he was, Skinner made his customary dash for his train.  Honey was used=
 to this, but she was=20

not prepared for what followed on this particular morning.  Skinner had onl=
y got halfway down to=20

the gate when he saw Stephen Colby's car coming down the road.  Here was th=
e multi-millionaire,=20

with whom he had talked on terms of equality the night before, making for t=
he Pullman end of his=20

train--here was he, Skinner, in his shabby old clothes.  Would Colby recogn=
ize him or would n't=20

he?  First, Skinner was afraid he would n't, then he was afraid he would.  =
He decided not to=20

chance it.  He darted back into the vestibule, drew the door half to, and w=
aited until the magnate's=20

car had passed; then he emerged from his hiding-place and made one of his c=
haracteristic heel-

and-toe sprints for the depot.  When he got there, he hurried into the smok=
er--the laboring man's=20

club.  Skinner repeated this somewhat eccentric advance, retreat, and quick=
 dash maneuver for=20

three successive days, dodging the formidable car of the magnate, and hopin=
g that Honey might=20

not be at her customary place at the front window to watch him off to his t=
rain.  At first, he was=20

amused.  It was a joke on himself, he thought.  But repetition presently du=
lled the edge of comedy.=20

On the fourth occasion of this apparently unaccountable behavior on Skinner=
's part, the "cage=20

man" began to meditate the matter.  Would he have to do this dodging act ev=
ery day, like a=20

fugitive, he wondered?  It was dawning upon him that his shabby clothes had=
 made him a fugitive=20

from respectability.  By jingo!  He sat up straight as he realized for the =
first time that he was the=20

only poorly dressed commuter of whom Meadeville might boast.  He had prided=
 himself that he'd=20

never given a cuss what other people thought of his clothes, so long as his=
 bank account was=20

intact.  By Jove!  Perhaps he'd never known what they thought because they =
were too polite to tell=20

him!  If he'd had no one but himself to consider, Skinner would have made t=
he plunge and bought=20

a new business suit right away--even in the face of what that might entail.=
  And his experience with=20

the dress suit had taught him that every purchase was fraught with complex =
possibilities. But how=20

could he spring it on Honey--chief guardian of the bank account?  Honey, to=
o, pondered Skinner's=20

curious dash out and back, the first day he did it.  She had her suspicions=
, but said nothing.  She=20

simply waited until the following morning to confirm them.  And when the wh=
ole combination of=20

circumstances--Skinner's advance, Colby's car appearing down the road, Skin=
ner's retreat--was=20

repeated, it was as plain as an open book to the perspicacious little lady.=
  Dearie was shabby, and=20

for the first time in his life he had realized the disadvantage of it.  She=
 was secretly glad, for she=20

had always felt that Dearie's thrift with regard to clothes was misplaced. =
 But she could never get=20

him to see it that way.  The mere flashing by of Stephen Colby had done mor=
e for Skinner in that=20

particular than years of affectionate solicitude on her part.  "Really," sh=
e mused, "some men have=20

to be blasted out of a rut with dynamite!"  From recent experience, Honey d=
educed that Skinner=20

would shy at any new purchase, with its ramifying possibilities.  Then how =
to prepare the way?=20

Honey was an arch diplomat--and--Honey was a great cook.  Honey met Skinner=
 at the door the=20

evening of the fourth day and gently drew him into the dining-room.  "Look!=
" she cried, pointing to=20

the table.  "Oysters!--and later--beefsteak!  Think of it!  Beefsteak!"  Sk=
inner noted with some relief=20

that it was the same formula she had used on a previous memorable occasion.=
  What could it=20



presage?  Was it possible that his soul and her soul had but a single thoug=
ht?  Had he betrayed=20

himself by his shuttle-like performance of the past four mornings?  Had she=
 observed him, and=20

was she "wise"?  The matter of the business suit was upper-most in the mind=
 of each. But as it=20

was something that involved a further assault upon their financial strongho=
ld, it was a subject that=20

must be approached with great tact.  Each, dreading an avalanche of reproac=
h, waited for the=20

other to speak.  And it was not until Skinner had finished his second demi-=
tasse that he began,=20

using the suggestive rather than the assertive form of speech, a form frequ=
ently used in the=20

"feeling-out" process.  He knew that he could tell by the way Honey receive=
d his suggestion=20

whether to go ahead or gracefully to change the subject and save his face. =
 "I notice, Honey, that=20

Colby and Crawford and the rest of that bunch wear dark business suits," he=
 ventured.  "Dark, but=20

generally with a fine, threadlike stripe, and ties to match always," Honey =
said softly.  "And the=20

simplest jewelry," she went on,--"inexpensive jewelry!"  Then they both fel=
l silent.  "I know what=20

you're thinking about," Skinner ventured again, not unwilling to shift the =
burden.  "What?"  "You=20

want me to get a new business suit.  Now, don't deny it."  He made the "don=
't deny it" suggest a=20

warning, almost a threat.  But now that the ice was broken, Honey did n't t=
ake the plunge.  Instead,=20

she felt her way in.  "You have n't had one for ever so long--and that was =
only a _cheap_ one."  "I=20

would n't need one now if I did n't have to live up to that darned dress su=
it you made me buy."=20

Honey sighed.  "Think of the cost," Skinner went on, still using the sugges=
tive form and leaving=20

himself an avenue of escape, if necessary.  Honey threw her head back and l=
ooked resolutely into=20

Skinner's eyes. "Cost or no cost, you must have one!"  Skinner had accompli=
shed his purpose and=20

had at the same time avoided the odium of doing so.  But Honey had no such =
scruples.  She had=20

taken the initiative and she was going to see the thing through to the limi=
t.  "But we must be very=20

careful about the socks and ties--for, of course, you know, Dearie, you mus=
t get socks and ties,"=20

she went on.  "I have figured it all out."  "You have, you fraud?" said Ski=
nner.  Honey pouted=20

reproachfully, and he hastened to add, "I, too, have figured it all out."  =
"You fraud!"  Honey came=20

over and put her head on Skinner's shoulder.  "Are n't we the great little =
conspirators, you and I?"=20

said Dearie, as he stroked Honey's glossy hair.  "Yes, each one conspiring =
all alone by himself=20

against the other."  Next day Skinner bought a new business suit, and accor=
dingly jotted down:--=20

_Dress-Suit Account_             _Debit_                         _Credit_  =
  Extension dress-suit plant!   One=20

business suit! .... $50.00   The first morning Skinner wore his new suit to=
 business, he left the=20

house for the depot with head erect.  He did n't give a rap whether Colby s=
aw him or not.  But=20

good luck always attends the indifferent in spirit.  Colby's car flashed by=
 and the multi-millionaire=20

nodded genially to the "cage man," which elated the latter, for he liked Co=
lby--felt that in a way he=20

was a man after his own heart.  But Skinner was too wise to attempt to forc=
e himself on the=20

magnate.  If there were to be any further cultivation of mutual acquaintanc=
e, he resolved to let=20

Colby take the initiative.  He would wait.  As Skinner entered the office o=
f McLaughlin & Perkins,=20

Inc., conscious of his new clothes and suffering somewhat from stage fright=
, he sensed something=20

in the air of the great room that was devoted to the fluttering femininity =
of the concern, something=20

humorous.  But as he was a man of authority there, there was no outward man=
ifestation of the=20

same.  The messenger boys from outside, however, were not subject to the ru=
les of McLaughlin &=20

Perkins, Inc.  "Gee," Skinner heard Mickey, the "littlest," whisper to Jimm=
y of the Postal, "pipe de=20

new glad rags on de cage man!"  And Postal, duly impressed, admonished, "Yo=
u better not burn=20



any wood in here now 'cause he'll git after you."  Then, in a whisper, "He =
never did before 'cause=20

he never had any breeches on an' he did n't dare to run out."  "How do you =
know dat?"  "You=20

never seen him below de middle of his vest, did you?"  "From down here, loo=
kin' up, wid dat=20

winder in de way, I never seen him much below his collar," whispered Mickey=
, the "littlest."  "Well,=20

den, you never knew whether he had breeches on or not," pursued the young l=
ogician.  Skinner's=20

lips trembled as he overheard, but he took no official notice.  Instead, he=
 frowned hard at his cash-

book.  But when the boys had gone, he turned his face away from the flutter=
ing femininity in the=20

big room and his form shook with emotion.  After a bit, he took out his lit=
tle book and wrote:--=20

_Dress-Suit Account_             _Debit_                         _Credit_  =
                                    The best=20

laugh I ever                                     had--in this or any of my =
                                    previous=20

existences.  Later in the day, Skinner crossed to the office of Ransome & C=
ompany, on a matter of=20

business for the firm.  There was no one there when he entered but the offi=
ce boy.  But the=20

youngster, from force of habit, when he saw Skinner, the acquiescent one, s=
aid, "Mr. Ransome's=20

very busy this morning."  "So am _I_ very busy," Skinner jerked out.  "Just=
 tell him I'm here."  The=20

boy looked at Skinner in surprise, then without a word shambled into the in=
side office.  Presently, a=20

tall, pompous man entered and looked about for somebody to take his name to=
 Ransome.  As the=20

boy emerged from the private office, he caught sight of this gentleman and =
darted back.  In a few=20

moments he returned and spoke to Skinner.  "Mr. Ransome'll see _you_ just a=
s soon as he's=20

finished with this gentleman," indicating the pompous one.  But the new bus=
iness clothes had=20

knocked all the acquiescence out of Skinner.  In their spic-and-spanness th=
ey fairly shrieked for=20

respect.  "See here, boy," Skinner exclaimed angrily, "you tell Mr. Ransome=
 that I was here before=20

this gentleman and that I want him to see me now or not at all!"  "But--"  =
"Go!" said Skinner.  "My=20

firm is important if I'm not," he muttered as the boy disappeared.  And as =
Ransome was seller to,=20

instead of a buyer from, McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc., he came out immediatel=
y, rubbing his hands.=20

"Why, Mr. Skinner, I did n't know you were in a hurry."  "Personally, I'm n=
ot," replied Skinner, "but=20

my firm's time is valuable."  "Of course--of course--come right in."  When =
he got back to his cage,=20

Skinner jotted down in his little book:--                     _Dress-Suit A=
ccount_             _Debit_=20

_Credit_                                      One victory over detested    =
                                 office boy!  Good=20

moral effect.                                     Shan't waste any more tim=
e                                     hereafter=20

just to accommodate                                     pompous individuals=
!   "Say, Mac," said Perkins at=20

luncheon, "did you notice our Skinner's brand-new attire?"  "Yes, Perk," sa=
id the senior partner,=20

"and I 'm mighty glad of it.  I was always ashamed of him--the way he dress=
ed."     CHAPTER VII=20

SKINNER AND THE "GOLD BUGS"  A new and unforseen, but perfectly logical, de=
velopment=20

from the purchase of the new business suit awaited Skinner a few days later=
.  It came about in this=20

way.  He was making his customary heel-and-toe sprint for the depot when St=
ephen Colby came=20

bowling along in his 60 H.P.  That gentleman nodded to Skinner, pulled up, =
and took him in.=20

"You're late," he said genially.  "I am, by Jove, and thank you for the lif=
t," said Skinner.  "I've been=20

wanting to tell you a story," said Colby.  "I had it on my list the other n=
ight, but somehow I did n't=20

get to it.  You know, you can't always follow the list you make out.  Stori=
es have got to be apropos=20

of something somebody else says, so my list always gets mixed up and I miss=
 telling some of the=20

best ones."  It was one of the multi-millionaire's pleasures to regale his =
friends with anecdotal=20

matter of his own experience.  But before he had finished this particular s=
tory, they had reached=20



the depot.  The train had already pulled in and Colby, still talking, led t=
he way into the Pullman.=20

Skinner hesitated on the threshold of that unaccustomed domain, but he felt=
 that the magnate=20

expected him to go in with him, and he followed.  In the "cage man" Colby f=
ound a fresh audience.=20

All the way into town he talked about his past efforts, from the time he sl=
ept under the grocery-

store counter until he reached the Presidency of the Steel Company, and Ski=
nner, fascinated and=20

sympathetic, "listened" his way into the magnate's esteem.  Quite a number =
of the other "gold=20

bugs"--as Skinner had dubbed them--whom he had seen at the Crawford affair =
were in the=20

Pullman. They nodded to Skinner in a cordial way, which put him at once at =
his ease, and he soon=20

felt quite as much at home in the Pullman as he had in the smoker.  That ni=
ght he told Honey all=20

about it.  "It only costs twenty-five cents extra," he said apologetically.=
  "That's nothing.  I'm glad=20

you did it, Dearie.  You must do it every day."  "Very well," said Skinner.=
  A few days later Skinner=20

said to Honey, as he stretched his long legs under the table and sipped his=
 second demi-tasse,=20

"Well, Honey, I've joined the Pullman Club for keeps.  It only costs a doll=
ar and a half a week."=20

"It's well worth the money," said Honey.  Skinner regarded his beautiful li=
ttle wife through half-

closed eyes. He was puzzled.  What curious change had been wrought in this =
exponent--this=20

almost symbol--of thrift that she should actually encourage him in the purs=
uit of the ruinous course=20

into which he'd been thrust by the wonderful dress suit!  He said nothing, =
but he jotted down in his=20

little book:--                     _Dress-Suit Account_             _Debit_=
                         _Credit_    To=20

operating expenses:     $1.50 a week.   The trip into town in the Pullman e=
ach day was a social=20

event with Skinner.  He looked forward to it and what he learned was each n=
ight a subject of=20

gossip at the dinner table.  "It's a regular 'joy ride' and I'm getting all=
 kinds of good out of it," said=20

he timber-yard, heard a sound as of a person moaning within. Entrance to th=
e yard is obtained=20

through a pair of wooden gates, which are in a very dilapidated condition, =
being practically off their=20

hinges. Indeed, by persons of the neighbourhood they are regarded as unsafe=
, and as likely soon=20

to fall to pieces. The policeman, passing through these gates and going som=
e distance into the=20

yard--his course being guided by the faint moaning which had first arrested=
 his attention--saw=20

before him a woman in a frightful state. She was bleeding from a deep wound=
 at the back of her=20

neck, which must have been inflicted some hours previously, and was not suf=
ficiently sensible to=20

understand or reply to the questions addressed to her. Without delay the po=
liceman procured=20

assistance, and the woman was conveyed to St. Thomas's Hospital, where she =
was examined by=20

the surgeon, who pronounced the wound she had received fatal, giving it as =
his opinion that she=20

could not live twenty-four hours. Her pockets, which bore the appearance of=
 having been rifled,=20

contained nothing which afforded a clue to her name or address, nor were he=
r clothes marked in a=20

way which would lead to her identification. At ten o'clock this morning the=
 woman recovered=20

consciousness, and being made sensible that death was approaching, requeste=
d the presence of=20

a magistrate, to whom she made her dying deposition, which we give here wor=
d for word:  "'My=20

name is Maria Baily. I was in the employ of a wealthy lady, Mrs. Quinlan. I=
 was acquainted with a=20

man who called himself Captain Ablewhite, but that is not his right name, a=
nd I don't know what is.=20

He promised to marry me, and he prevailed upon me to steal a diamond bracel=
et of great value. It=20

was worth forty or fifty thousand pounds. What I did with the bracelet afte=
r I took it from the jewel-

safe of my mistress has been described in all the papers. We were stopping =
at the Langham=20

Hotel. A man was waiting outside on the night I stole it, and I went and ga=
ve it to him, and then I=20



ran away from my service to a room Captain Ablewhite had taken for me in Le=
man Street,=20

Whitechapel. Captain Ablewhite told me that the man to whom I gave the brac=
elet was named=20

Jeremiah Pamflett, and that his master, a rich money-lender, Miser Farebrot=
her, was going to lend=20

money on it. Three days after I stole the bracelet Captain Ablewhite took m=
e away to Germany,=20

and I remained with him some time.  "'He told me that Jeremiah Pamflett had=
 cheated him; that he=20

had promised to get four thousand pounds from Miser Farebrother for the bra=
celet, and that=20

Jeremiah Pamflett had given him only two hundred. When the account was put =
into the=20

newspapers that the bracelet I had stolen was of no value, and that the sto=
nes in it were false,=20

Captain Ablewhite said it was not true, and that the bracelet I had given t=
o Jeremiah Pamflett was=20

the real one. Then Captain Ablewhite quarrelled with me, and deserted me. N=
ot knowing what to=20

do, I returned to London and found out Jeremiah Pamflett. I thought it woul=
d have been difficult to=20

find him, but it was very easy, because his master had been murdered, and t=
here was a great trial=20

just over, in which Miser Farebrother's daughter had been found guilty of t=
he murder of her father.=20

Jeremiah Pamflett tried to escape from me; but I would not let him, and the=
 end of it was that he=20

confessed he had the bracelet in his possession; and he proposed that he, h=
is mother, and I=20

should all go away together to America, where he would be able to sell the =
diamonds, and where,=20

changing our names, we could live in safety. We were to meet last night at =
Nine Elms, and he and=20

his mother were there when I arrived. So that we could talk together undist=
urbed, he took me to=20

the place in which I was discovered, and there we had a quarrel. He wanted =
to give me ten=20

pounds only, and said that he would send me more after he got safely away. =
I was in a great=20

passion, and I asked him if Miser Farebrother had given him four thousand p=
ounds for the=20

bracelet--which money he said he had given to Captain Ablewhite--how it was=
 that it was now in=20

his possession. He said that was his business; and then we got to higher wo=
rds, and I accused=20

him of murdering Miser Farebrother so that he might rob him. Then Jeremiah =
Pamflett said: "Do=20

you want to know the truth? I did kill him; and that is how I got the brace=
let back again. But you=20

shall not live to tell anybody else. I will kill you as I killed the miser!=
" As he said that, he plunged a=20

knife into me, and I fell to the ground. The last words I heard were what h=
is mother said: "She is=20

dead; you have killed her. Let us get away as quick as possible." I do not =
remember anything=20

more. I know I am dying. And I swear to God that I have told nothing but th=
e truth!'  "Maria Baily=20

signed this deposition, and then almost immediately became unconscious. The=
 latest reports are=20

to the effect that she cannot live through the night.  "Thus, in a strange =
and providential manner, a=20

frightful injustice has been averted. It is singular that on the very day o=
n which Jeremiah Pamflett=20

committed this second murder, other evidence was obtained of the innocence =
of the young lady=20

who, by an error of justice, was pronounced guilty of the murder of her fat=
her. The strongest=20

evidence against the unfortunate and cruelly-wronged lady was supplied by a=
 friend who had a=20

deep affection for her. We refer to the evidence of Tom Barley, a policeman=
, who swore that he=20

saw in the grounds of Parksides, at the time of the murder of the miser, a =
woman in a blue dress.=20

Such a dress did Miss Farebrother wear when she went from her aunt's house =
in London, with the=20

intention of asking her father for some assistance by which her aunt's fami=
ly could be extricated=20

from a temporary difficulty. It is now proved that Tom Barley is colour-bli=
nd, and that the woman he=20

really saw had on a pink dress, such as Mrs. Pamflett, Jeremiah Pamflett's =
mother, wore on that=20

occasion. This strange discovery opens up a fruitful field of speculation. =
Other evidence is also=20



forthcoming which indubitably establishes Miss Farebrother's innocence.  "T=
here is now no reason=20

to doubt that the story related by Mrs. Pamflett of the events of the night=
 on which Miser=20

Farebrother met his death was from first to last a cunningly invented fabri=
cation. Part of this=20

evidence is supplied by a gentleman who has been absent from England on bus=
iness, and who=20

testifies that Jeremiah Pamflett did not return to Miser Farebrother's Lond=
on office until seven=20

o'clock of the morning of the murder. It will be remembered that Jeremiah P=
amflett swore that he=20

returned at eleven o'clock on the previous night. He and his mother are at =
large: they could=20

scarcely have had time and opportunity to effect their escape, as a watch w=
as kept upon all the=20

outgoing trains to the Continent last night. The police are on the alert, a=
nd it is to be hoped, in the=20

interests of justice, that the criminals will soon be arrested and put upon=
 their trial for their=20

diabolical crimes."     CHAPTER XVII.  CHIEFLY CONCERNING FANNY.   Of all P=
hoebe's friends=20

and well-wishers there was only one who did not openly share in the joy occ=
asioned by her=20

release. Congratulations poured in from all sides, even from strangers at a=
 distance, whose letters=20

of sympathy were delivered by smiling postmen at Aunt Leth's house at least=
 half a dozen times a=20

day. Phoebe's escape from her dread peril was, indeed, universally hailed w=
ith thankfulness and=20

gratitude. Everybody was glad; the newspapers found in it a fruitful theme =
for grave disquisition;=20

and Phoebe became a heroine in the best and sweetest sense of the term. As =
for Uncle Leth's=20

day-dreams, as he walked to his bank in the morning and home from his day's=
 labours in the=20

evening, imagination could not excel them in delightfulness. Sunshine reign=
ed in his home and in=20

the hearts of all he loved.  The one friend who held aloof was Tom Barley. =
No person was more=20

profoundly grateful than he at the proclamation of Phoebe's innocence; but =
he contracted a horror=20

of himself as being the principal cause of his dear young mistress's suffer=
ings. All appeals to him=20

to soften this hard judgment were vain; he would scarcely listen to them, a=
nd when, against his=20

will, he was compelled to do so, they had no effect upon him.  "It ain't a =
bit of good speaking to=20

me," he said, moodily; "I don't deserve to live. And I shouldn't care to bu=
t for one thing."  That one=20

thing was a fierce burning desire to bring Jeremiah Pamflett and his wicked=
 mother to justice. For,=20

strange to say, all the vigilance of the police had proved fruitless; the w=
retches were still at liberty,=20

and not the slightest clue to their hiding-place had been discovered. A mon=
th had passed since=20

Phoebe's release, and they had successfully evaded pursuit. It was believed=
 by some that they=20

had escaped from the country; but Tom Barley held a different opinion. He w=
as still in the force--a=20

capable, faithful public servant, zealous and judicious in the performance =
of his duties, and=20

regarded with esteem by his superiors; but a blight had fallen upon his lif=
e--a blight which he felt=20

would not be removed until, through him, and through him alone, justice was=
 satisfied. This idea=20

grew into a kind of disease in him. It seemed as if he could exist without =
sleep. When not on duty=20

he was indefatigable in hunting up clues, in making secret inquiries, in ke=
eping watch in out-of-the-

way places for the monsters of iniquity at whose door a double murder lay. =
He took no person into=20

his confidence; he would accept no assistance; and he devoted every spare m=
inute to the design=20

upon which he had set his heart. His friends did not relinquish their effor=
ts to woo him to a more=20

peaceful and better frame of mind. Accompanied by Fred Cornwall, Phoebe wen=
t to him, and=20

begged him not to torment himself with self-reproach. He listened to her in=
 silence, with head bent=20

down.  "Will you not speak to me, Tom?" she asked, imploringly.  "What can =
I say?" was his=20

humble response. "How can I hope that you will ever forgive me?"  "But ther=
e is nothing to forgive,=20



Tom," she said, sweetly, holding out her hand.  "It is like you to say so,"=
 he replied, "and it makes it=20

all the worse for me."  "I never knew you to be unkind to me before, Tom," =
she said.  He turned=20

away from her, and would not accept her hand. Fred Cornwall followed him, a=
nd said,  "You=20

should not make her suffer, Tom; you are inflicting great pain upon the swe=
etest lady in the world."=20

"She is that, sir," said Tom, "and more. If I could die at her feet to save=
 her a minute's pain I'd be=20

glad to do it. Look here, sir; when I bring two devils to justice I'll ask =
her to forgive me; but not till=20

then!"  'Melia Jane tried her arts upon him, and even waylaid him one night=
 in a quiet corner, with=20

a pack of cards in her hands, with which she begged to be allowed to tell h=
is fortune; but he was=20

adamant. Nevertheless, his friends would not desert him.  "He is too good a=
 fellow to be lost sight=20

of," said Fred Cornwall; "we'll win him back to us yet."  There was a brigh=
t future before Fred and=20

his dear girl. Miser Farebrother had died without a will, and Phoebe came i=
nto possession of the=20

property he left behind him. Investigation proved that it had been tampered=
 with by Jeremiah=20

Pamflett, but a competence was saved from the wreck. The greatest happiness=
 Phoebe derived=20

from this was that it enabled her to assist Aunt and Uncle Leth out of thei=
r difficulties. Happy were=20

the evenings spent in the old home in Camden Town. Affairs were prospering =
with Fred Cornwall=20

in the exercise of his profession. Events had brought his name into promine=
nce, and briefs were=20

flowing in. In a great measure he had Dick Garden to thank for this better =
turn in his fortunes. This=20

astute young fellow would not take all the credit to himself of setting jus=
tice right; he made it public=20

that it was due equally to his friend Fred, and both of them were on the hi=
gh-road to fame. Fred=20

seldom made his appearance in Aunt Leth's house without Dick, who seemed to=
 find therein some=20

great attraction. The strange and solemn experiences of the last few weeks =
had made Fanny=20

Lethbridge quieter and less lively than of old; but occasionally flashes of=
 her pleasant, saucy=20

humour peeped out, to the delight of all, and especially to the delight of =
Dick Garden, who=20

generally contrived to obtain a seat next to her. It was too soon for teasi=
ng to commence, else=20

Bob, who was suspected of having a second or third love affair on hand, mig=
ht have ventured=20

retaliation upon his sister, and, judging from what was stirring in Fanny's=
 heart, he would assuredly=20

have had the best of it. For the present, however, she was spared; the spir=
it of tender, grateful=20

love which reigned in the happy home was too profound even for innocent jes=
t. Doubtless,=20

however, the time would come when the merry equilibrium would be restored. =
 "Fred," said Dick=20

Garden, as they were walking home one night from the Lethbridges', "when ar=
e you and Miss=20

Farebrother going to get married?"  "Not settled yet," replied Fred; "nothi=
ng said about it. We must=20

let some nine or ten months pass, I suppose."  "About this time next year, =
perhaps?"  "Yes; or a=20

little earlier if I can bring it about. Thinking of anything particular, Di=
ck?"  "Yes, old fellow."  "In=20

connection with our wedding?"  "Well--partly."  "With weddings generally, t=
hen?"  "Not generally,=20

Fred, specifically. Of course a fellow doesn't know anything yet."  "Of cou=
rse not," said Fred,=20

smiling. "Shall I guess a name?"  "Try."  "Fanny?"  "Yes, Fanny," said Dick=
 Garden, and then there=20

was a little pause. "Fred, you have known them a long time?"  "I have."  "G=
ood people?"  "The=20

best, the sweetest, the most faithful and devoted. Would to Heaven the worl=
d was filled with such!"=20

"I am with you there. But what I want to ask you is about Miss Lethbridge."=
  "Fanny? Yes."  "I don't=20

wish you to betray family secrets, old fellow; but she is such a lovely gir=
l--"  "She is."  "With so=20

beautiful a nature that she could not fail to have attracted--you know what=
 I mean, Fred; I am=20

putting it rather lamely."  "An attachment?"  "Yes; but _you_ put it somewh=
at coarsely."  "Didn't=20



mean to, Dick. Quite right that you should be sensitive. Attracted? Rather!=
 A dozen at least have=20

sighed for her, and sighed in vain."  "Why?"  "Not the right ones, Dick. If=
 there is one quality above=20

another which distinguishes Fanny it is genuineness. A more genuine girl do=
esn't breathe. Dick, to=20

be admitted upon terms of intimacy with that family is a privilege."  "I es=
teem it=20


_
good commercial proposition."  "Don't talk about the commercial side of it,=
 Dearie.  Tell me about=20

the 'gold bugs.'"  "They're wonderful fellows," said Skinner, with the air =
of a man who had always=20

been accustomed to traveling with such people and was now unbending to conf=
ide familiar items=20

of special interest to some unsophisticated listener.  "You'd find them fas=
cinating."  "They 're just=20

like other men, are n't they?"  Skinner rather pitied her inexperience.  "N=
o, they're not.  They're just=20

like great, big boys.  The most natural talkers in the world--simple, direc=
t, clear."  "Do you ever=20

talk?"  This question brought Skinner back to earth again.  He was just Dea=
rie now.  "_Do_ I?=20

Say, Honey, I've been isolated in that cage of mine so long that I thought =
I'd forgotten how to talk.=20

But you'd be surprised to hear me--right in with the rest of them!"  "But y=
ou can't talk big things,=20

Dearie, like them.  You don't _know_ big things."  "Bless you, they don't t=
alk big things.  They tell=20

anecdotes.  And they talk about the time when they were boys--and their ear=
ly struggles. reason."=20

"It is. Where she gives her hand she will give her heart. They go together-=
-both or none."  "Do you=20

think--that is, have you any sort of idea--that she has met the right one a=
t last?"  "Seriously, Dick?=20

In perfect faith and honour?"  "Seriously, Fred. In perfect faith and honou=
r."  "Dick, old boy," said=20

Fred, earnestly, "I _have_ a sort of idea that she has."  "You are a shrewd=
 fellow, Fred--you have=20

a trick of observation. You know what I mean?"  "I do, Dick."  "Well, then,=
 good luck to us!"  The=20

month was November; a fog was gathering; a light mist was dissolving, and f=
alling cold and chill;=20

but Dick Garden was glowing from within. As he was buttoning his coat a man=
 brushed past them,=20

and Fred caught a glimpse of his face.  "A moment, Dick," he said, hurriedl=
y, "that is Tom Barley. I=20

must have a word with him."  He hastened after Tom, and accosted him.  "It =
_is_ you, Tom. Have=20

you any news?"  "None, sir--that is, none that I can speak of. Don't stop m=
e, please; I haven't a=20

minute to spare." These words came straggling from Tom's lips, and in his a=
nxiety he seemed=20


_
all love to tell how often their fathers licked 'em.  And they gossip about=
 their old friends and=20

things.  The ride in is not business, Honey, it's social.  There's one thin=
g I've discovered in that=20

Pullman Club," he went on.  "These fellows are n't any cleverer than many a=
 man in my position,=20

but they've realized that it's just as easy to play with blue chips as with=
 white ones--and they've got=20

the nerve to do it."  "I don't catch on."  "It's just as easy to play with =
dollars as with dimes--just as=20

easy to write an order for a thousand as for ten.  And it's easier to do bu=
siness with big men.=20

They're more imaginative, quicker to grasp."  "That's how they got there," =
Honey interjected.  "But=20

particularly, Honey, these men are all keen students of human nature.  They=
 can size a man up--

gee!  'Brown's able,' says one.  'Yes, but he's tricky,' says another.  'Ca=
rpenter's honest, but he's a=20

fool.' With the 'gold bugs' credit is a combination of honesty and ability.=
"  Skinner sipped his demi-

tasse reflectively.  "Honey, you remember what Russell Sage said in reply t=
o Horace Greeley's,=20

'Go West, young man!'  No?  Well, this is what he said: 'If you want to mak=
e money, go where the=20

money is.' _I 've_ begun to go where the money is.  See the connection?"  "=
I'm glad you have,"=20

said Honey, nodding her head.  "Those clerks you used to travel with never =
thought big thoughts=20

or they would n't have been clerks."  "But remember, Honey, I'm only a cler=
k."  "But you never did=20

belong in the clerk class."  "You're right!  I never did!  I'm beginning to=
 realize it now.  Why, do you=20

know,"--leaning over the table and counting off his words with his finger,-=
-"I've had ideas that if I 'd=20

only been able to carry out, ideas that I got right in that little cage of =
mine--"  Thus Skinner's=20

education progressed.  He took as enthusiastic a delight in studying the "g=
old bugs" as a naturalist=20

would in some very ancient, but recently discovered, insect.  "I 'm finding=
 out lots of good things in=20

that Pullman Club, Honey," said Skinner a week later at the dinner table.  =
"Every one of these=20

'gold bugs' has something under his skin.  They may be Dick Turpins and Cla=
ude Duvals and Sam=20

Basses, their methods of getting things may not be ideal, but you can't bea=
t their methods of=20

giving.  They've all got lovable qualities.  They do a lot of things that s=
how it--and they don't use a=20

brass band accompaniment either."  "For instance?" said Honey, simply and s=
weetly.  "Well," said=20

Skinner, "take old John Mackensie.  He's so close that they say his grandfa=
ther was the man who=20

chased the last Jew out of Aberdeen."  Skinner picked up the paper.  "See t=
hose initials, honey?=20

'D. C. D.'"  "I've noticed them."  "Old Mackensie, when he was a boy, came =
near starving to death.=20

A reporter got hold of his case and printed a paragraph about it just like =
those you see every day.=20

I got it on the quiet.  Mackensie was saved by an anonymous friend who sign=
ed himself 'D. C. D.'=20

He never could find out who it was.  Several years passed.  He watched the =
papers, but these=20

initials never appeared again.  So Mackensie concluded that his unknown sav=
ior was dead.  "But=20

he made up his mind to pass the good deed along and here's the romance of i=
t.  He wants=20

whoever it was that helped him to get all the credit for it.  He wants him =
to be reminded--if he=20

happens to be alive and 'broke'--that the good thought started is being pus=
hed along.  So to-day a=20

newspaper tells a story of an unfortunate girl--a starving boy picked up by=
 the police--a helpless=20

widow--a friendless old man.  The next day you read, 'Rec'd from D. C. D. $=
20.'--'D. C. D. $50'--as=20

the case may be.  That's old man Mackensie."  "And yet they say money kills=
 romance."  Honey's=20

eyes shone with appreciation.  "And there's Solon Wright," Skinner went on,=
 "another 'gold bug.'=20

For years every night he has handed a dollar to a certain shambling fellow =
outside the ferry gate."=20

"How curious!"  "Briscom told me about it.  The strange thing is, it's a ma=
n Wright used to detest=20

when he was flush.  He does n't like him even now. That's why he gives him =
the money.  Moral=20



discipline, the way he puts it.  Can you beat it?"  As a result of these ob=
servations in the Pullman,=20

Skinner jotted down in his little book:--                     _Dress-Suit A=
ccount_             _Debit_=20

_Credit_                                      Interesting discovery of     =
                                generally=20

unsuspected facts                                     in the habits of "gol=
d bugs."   While Skinner was sailing=20

over a fair sea, untroubled by anything but the growing fear that some day =
Honey might find him=20

out,--about the  "Am I mistaken in the idea that you have heard something?"=
 asked Fred.  "No, sir,=20

you are not mistaken. I am on their track."  "As you have been before, Tom?=
"  "That's true, sir,"=20

said Tom, with a sigh; "as I have been before."  "Can I assist you?"  "No, =
sir; nor any one. What I=20

do I'll do single-handed." He wrenched himself free. "Good-night, sir."  "O=
nly another word, Tom.=20

Have you any message for Miss Phoebe? She told me, if I met you, to give yo=
u her love."  "Did=20

she, sir? She's an angel of goodness. Any message, sir? Yes, this--if I don=
't live to accomplish=20

what I've set my life upon, if I don't live to ask her forgiveness myself, =
to think of me kindly=20

sometimes as a man who would gladly have died for her!"  He darted away, an=
d was lost in the=20

mist. Fred gazed thoughtfully after him, and then he rejoined Garden.  "The=
re goes an honest,=20

suffering man," he said; "thorough to the backbone. He has inflicted a mart=
yrdom upon himself,=20

and is following a will-o'-the-wisp."  But the events of the next few hours=
 were destined to prove=20

that Fred Cornwall was in error.     CHAPTER XVIII.  A LIFE-AND-DEATH STRUG=
GLE.   It was an=20

hour past midnight, and the fog had deepened so that a man could scarcely s=
ee a yard before=20

him. On the North Finchley Road it lay particularly thick, and the sky and =
surrounding space=20

seemed to be blotted out--as they certainly were from two wayfarers who plo=
dded their way slowly=20

onward through the darkness. They were a man and a woman, who, although the=
y were wrapped=20

in gloom, cast apprehensive glances on all sides, and frequently stopped to=
 listen for sounds of=20

footsteps.  "Jeremiah, my love," said the woman, shivering, "why did you in=
sist upon our leaving=20

our nice warm quarters on such a night? It will be the death of me."  "_I'l=
l_ be the death of you,"=20

growled the man, "if you call me by my name! Mind that, you old fool!"  "Do=
n't speak to me so=20

hard!" implored the woman; "no one can hear us. The night ain't fit for a d=
og to be out in it."=20

"That's the reason we're out in it," said Jeremiah, with a curse. "Hold you=
r row, if you don't want=20

me to do you a mischief!"  "Oh!" murmured Mrs. Pamflett, "that you should s=
ay such things to me=20

after all I've done for you!"  "After all you've done for me! Yes, you _hav=
e_ done for me! If it hadn't=20

been for you dragging at my heels I should have been out of this infernal s=
crape weeks ago.=20

You're a nice mother, you are! What's the use of such as you, I'd like to k=
now?"  They were so well=20

disguised that it would have been difficult even for those best acquainted =
with them to identify=20

them; hence Jeremiah's caution to his mother as to being careful with her s=
peech was not=20

unnecessary. Nevertheless, he presently spoke again, either because he deem=
ed that the=20

darkness by which they were surrounded afforded them sufficient security or=
 because he dreaded=20

the terrors of silence.  "Why did I insist upon our leaving our nice warm q=
uarters? You want me to=20

tell you that, do you?"  "Yes," she whined. "We were safe there--we were sa=
fe there!"  "We were=20

not! Had we remained we should have been nabbed by this time, and then what=
 chance would=20

have been left for us? The landlord warned me; he told me we were being hun=
ted down, and that=20

there was danger in our keeping in our hiding-place another night."  "Who h=
as hunted us down--

who, my love?"  "Yah! keep your love to yourself; I'm sick of it. Who? Ah, =
I should like to know,=20

and have him here! There'd be no more hunting down for him, I promise!"  "T=
he landlord was=20



frightened; he wanted to get rid of us."  "Frightened? Perhaps he was; but =
he would not have been=20

in a hurry to get rid of such good customers without good cause. He's had a=
 matter of a hundred=20

pounds already out of me, and he knew I had enough left to go on with a pre=
tty long time yet. But I=20

kept the diamond bracelet from him, with all his cunning. He wormed and wor=
med, but he never=20

got out of me that I had it safe about me. I was his match there. Let's hav=
e a look at it, mother. It=20

does one's heart good. It's the only thing that keeps me up."  He crouched =
down by the side of the=20

hedge and drew forth a dark lantern, which he lighted. Then he rose, and lo=
oked about him,=20

projecting the light into dark spaces around to make sure that no person wa=
s near. He saw=20

nothing, heard nothing. Down he crouched again, and from an inner pocket pu=
lled out a jewel-

case, which he opened.  "Look at them, mother--how they glitter and shine! =
Ah, you beauties,=20

there's nothing false about you! If we were safe in a foreign country, or i=
n America--I prefer=20

America, mother; looking for us there would be like looking for a needle in=
 a bottle of hay--if we=20

were safe there, with this in our pockets, we=20

"I saw our Skinner getting out of the Pullman this morning," said Perkins t=
o the senior partner.=20

"What of it?" said McLaughlin.  "I see him getting out of it every morning.=
"  "Still what of it?"=20

persisted McLaughlin.  "The Pullman habit isn't expensive--only a quarter f=
rom Meadeville."  "Oh,=20

nothing," observed Perkins.  "Nothing in itself, but new clothes and travel=
ing round in a Pullman=20

don't square with the fact that Skinner did n't get his raise."  McLaughlin=
 swung around in his chair.=20

"Say, Perk, what do you mean by these hints?  You never _did_ like Skinner.=
"  "You're mistaken,=20

Mac.  It was his clothes I did n't like."  "You've been throwing out hints,=
" McLaughlin reiterated,=20

"and bothering me so much lately about Skinner, I wish to goodness I _had_ =
raised his salary."  "I=20

know," Perkins persisted, "but see what our Skinner's habits have been in t=
he past--penurious.=20

Why the sudden change?  You know just as well as I do that a clerk can't tr=
avel around with the=20

by one, secretly,=20

secretly! It's the land for diamonds. Then I could have my fling."  Neither=
 of the pair saw or had any=20

suspicion of the shadow that was creeping through thicker shadows than itse=
lf, closer, closer,=20

closer. Neither of them saw, or had any suspicion of, the hand of doom comi=
ng nearer, nearer,=20

nearer, to strike terror to their guilty souls.  "Here, take a pull at this=
, mother," said Jeremiah,=20

handing her a bottle.  "It warms me, it warms me!" murmured Mrs. Pamflett. =
 "Don't empty the=20

bottle," cried Jeremiah, snatching it from her. "You're a selfish cat!"  "W=
hat did the landlord tell you,=20

Jeremiah, about our being hunted down?"  "There's been a man making inquiri=
es about the=20

lodgers, and offering money to find out things. He didn't know who he was, =
but it looked=20

suspicious, and we were safer out of the house than in it. Take another loo=
k at the beauties,=20

mother, before I put them away."  Closer, closer, closer crept the shadow. =
Closer, closer, closer=20

came the hand of doom.  "Do you think we _shall_ get safe away?" whispered =
Mrs. Pamflett, as=20

Jeremiah crouched, gloating over the diamonds.  "Do I think it?--I'm sure o=
f it! The police have=20

been too long off the scent for them to get on to it again. All we've got t=
o do is to be cunning,=20

cunning--"  "Jeremiah!" screamed Mrs. Pamflett.  The shadow loomed over=20


_
paper-cutter and waited.  "Tips are very good when they go right," Perkins =
went on, "but when=20

they go wrong--"  He hesitated.  "I get you.  They're dangerous to a man wh=
o is employed in a=20

fiduciary capacity," said McLaughlin very quietly.  "I believe as you do," =
urged Perkins, "that=20

Skinner is the most honest and loyal man in America--but other honest and l=
oyal men--well, darn=20

it, they're all human."  "Well?" McLaughlin observed, and waited.  "It's a =
part of wisdom to be=20

cautious.  It's just as much for his good as it is for ours.  An ounce of p=
revention, you know.=20

Besides, it's _our_ money he's handling."  "You may be right," said McLaugh=
lin, rising.  "But go=20

slow--wait a little.  I'll keep my eye on the Meadeville end of it for a wh=
ile."  Skinner not only=20

"listened" himself into the affections of Stephen Colby, but into the affec=
tions of other members of=20

the "gold-bug" set as well.  He won his way more with his ears than with hi=
s tongue.  He'd only=20

been a member of the Pullman contingent a fortnight when he and Honey were =
invited to dine with=20

the Howard Hemingways.  There they met all the vicarious members of the Pul=
lman Club--the=20

wives.  The Hemingway dinner was an open sesame to the Skinners.  The ladie=
s of the "walled-in"=20

element began to take Honey up.  They called on her. She was made a member =
of the bridge=20

club.  It cost Honey something to learn the game,--some diamond bracelet. I=
n a moment Jeremiah=20

had wrested it back again, and three human beings were engaged in a deadly =
struggle.  "I arrest=20

you," cried Tom Barley, "for the murder of Miser Farebrother and Maria Bail=
y!"  The contest was=20

unequal. Strong as Tom Barley was, Jeremiah and his mother had the strength=
 of desperation,=20

and they succeeded in flinging him off. But he fell on them again, and his =
cries for help rang loud=20

through the night.  "It's you, Tom Barley, is it?" muttered Jeremiah, as th=
e struggle was=20

proceeding. "It's you that's been hunting us down, is it?"  "Yes, it's me,"=
 said Tom Barley, getting=20

his mouth free--Mrs. Pamflett was endeavouring to stifle his cries with her=
 hand--"and as God is=20

your judge you're as good as dead!"  "Hold on to him, mother, a moment," sa=
id Jeremiah; "fix your=20

teeth in him! Say your prayers, Tom Barley; it's you that's as good as dead=
!"  "Ah!" screamed Tom,=20

and he dropped.  Jeremiah had succeeded in plucking a knife from his pocket=
, and, opening it,=20

had plunged it into Tom. He had aimed at the honest fellow's heart, but he =
had missed, and the=20

knife had gone through the upper part of the right arm, cutting it cruelly =
to the bone. It was this that=20

had caused Tom to let go his hold upon them. They took advantage of the rel=
ease, and fled=20

through the darkness. But in a moment Tom was on his feet again, and pursui=
ng them, the blood=20

flowing=20


_
losses,--but these were never charged to the dress-suit account, for a very=
 obvious reason.  So=20

popular did the Skinners become that it was seldom they dined at home.  Ski=
nner, methodical man=20

that he was, put down in his little book to the credit of the dress-suit ac=
count, not the value of the=20

dinner they got, but what they'd actually saved on each occasion.  And he b=
egan to feel that the=20

dress suit was earning good interest in cash on the investment.  The Skinne=
rs, now that they had=20

engaged in not feel the pain of it; all that he bemoaned was that his arm w=
as useless and that his=20

voice was growing weak. Before fifty yards were traversed he had seized the=
m again.  "Curse it!"=20

cried Jeremiah, "I have lost my knife."  "That's my luck," muttered Tom, cl=
inging to them.  "Help!=20

help!"  They beat him frightfully about the head, and he flung it feebly th=
is way and that in the=20

endeavour to escape the cruel blows; but he did not loose his hold of them =
again. In the blind and=20

dreadful struggle=20
