 to an unwarranted suspicion of murder. The two following cases cited by Ta=
ylor[642] well illustrate this fact:  In the case of Sellis,[643] the man w=
as generally supposed to be _
rank to our opponent, as any one may see who shall read our history of form=
er times. Beside, who=20

are they that would dare to oppose their sovereign lord, who, doing an act =
of justice according to=20

the evidence of truth, becomes a true and upright judge, as Tully showeth, =
in his second book of=20

Offices: =E2=80=98Judicis est semper verum sequi.=E2=80=99 A good judge sho=
uld give judgment according to truth.=20

=E2=80=98The same author says, in one of his orations before he went into b=
anishment,=E2=80=94=E2=80=98Nemo tam=20

facinorosus inventus est vita, ut non tamen judicum prius sententiis convin=
ceretur, quam suppliciis=20

applicaretur.=E2=80=99 No one has led so wicked a life but that a verdict h=
as been passed upon his case=20

before he was put to the torture.  =E2=80=98Thou art bounden, most potent k=
ing, to do justice; and should=20

any evil result from it, it will fall on the adverse party, on account of h=
is crimes, as I shall show to=20

you hereafter. The judgment of our LORD JESUS CHRIST will not certainly fai=
l of having its effect:=20

=E2=80=98Qui de gladio percutit, gladio peribit.=E2=80=99 Whoso kills with =
the sword shall die by the sword. And Ovid,=20

in his Art of Love, says, =E2=80=98Neque lex est =C3=A6quior ulla, quam nec=
is artifices arte perire sua.=E2=80=99 No law is=20

more just than that purposes of concealment. Some regard a wound in the bac=
k as proof against=20

suicidal origin, but it is not so much the situation of a wound as the situ=
ation taken in connection=20

with the direction which furnishes the proof against suicide in such wounds=
.  As a rule, a suicidal=20

wound, besides being in an accessible part of the body, is also in a part c=
ommonly known to be=20

rapidly mortal, as the neck and heart. But suicidal wounds are not always i=
n the situation which is=20

anatomically best for being rapidly fatal. Concealed wounds or wounds in in=
accessible parts=20

presumptive of murder may be suicidal and so placed to impute them to anoth=
er and give rise to=20

the suspicion of murder. The blood-vessels of the arms and legs may be sele=
cted as the site of a=20

suicidal wound. This situation is often regarded as uncommon, though the wr=
iter has met with it in=20

one or more cases of attempted suicide. It is illustrated in the famous cas=
e of Abdul Aziz, the=20

Sultan of Turkey. He was found dead under suspicious circumstances with two=
 oblique, ragged=20

wounds at the bend of each elbow, directed from above downward and from wit=
hin outward. The=20

joint on the left side was penetrated, while only the skin and veins=20


_
murderers should perish by their own arts.  =E2=80=98O, my lord king! open =
the gates of justice, and listen to=20

the very reasonable complaints which my lady of Orleans makes to thee, that=
 thou mayest verify in=20

thyself the words of the prophet, =E2=80=98Dilexisti justitiam et odisti in=
iquitatem propterea unxit te Deus=20

tuus oleo letici=C3=A6 pr=C3=A6 consortibus tuis;=E2=80=99 that is to say, =
Thou hast loved justice, and hast hated=20

iniquity, wherefore the Lord thy God has anointed thee with the oil of glad=
ness above thy=20

fellows;=E2=80=94and this finishes my fifth argument.  =E2=80=98My sixth an=
d last argument, for the present, is=20

founded on the conduct and demeanour of our opponent after this cruel and d=
etestable crime.=20

=E2=80=98There is nothing in this world a king should so much dread and che=
ck as the overbearing pride of=20

any subject in regard to his government; and thou, O king! oughtest to foll=
ow, in thy governance,=20

the example of the King of kings, of whom holy writ says, =E2=80=98Deus sup=
erbis resistit, humilibus autem=20

dat gratiam.=E2=80=99 God humbles the proud, and raises up the weak-hearted=
. Thou art therefore bound to=20

humble the pride of our opponent, which has increased to such a pitch as to=
 make him resist thy=20

power in the support of this his wicked deed.  =E2=80=98Oh! king of France,=
 and all ye my lords, weigh well=20

then the rebellion and disobedience of our adversary, not only against the =
commands of the king,=20

but contrary to the orders of the whole royal council. It is a well known f=
act, that the king of Sicily,=20

my lord of Berry, and several others, went lately to Amiens, side. Death wa=
s due to bleeding from=20

the ulnar artery and the veins. The clothing was soaked with blood and scis=
sors stained with blood=20

were found on the sofa. These wounds were consistent with suicide, though n=
ot what would be=20

expected. Nineteen physicians who examined the body agreed in reporting it =
as suicidal, though=20

one reason given for this opinion, namely, =E2=80=9Cthat the direction and =
nature of the wounds, as well as=20

the instrument which might have effected them, lead to the conclusion of su=
icide,=E2=80=9D was hardly a=20

valid one, for the wounds were not typical of suicide in nature, direction,=
 or position. Such wounds=20

are rarely homicidal, though at least one such case is mentioned.  Suicidal=
 incised wounds, as has=20

been said, are usually in the neck, where they may sometimes be arrested by=
 the larynx,=20

especially if it be ossified, though the incision often divides the larynx.=
 The situation of the wounds=20

is often between the larynx and the hyoid bone, and then meeting no bony re=
sistance, they may=20

divide the great vessels and even nick the vertebr=C3=A6. But it is rare to=
 be so deep, at least on both=20

sides at once. As a rule, it is deepest on the side on which it is begun an=
d ends more superficially.=20

As far as the situation of a wound is concerned, there is no wound which a =
suicide can inflict but=20

what may also be inflicted by a murderer. The reverse, however, is not true=
. We cannot always=20

certainly distinguish between suicidal and homicidal wounds from their situ=
ation.  =3DThe direction of=20

the wound=3D is one of the most=20


_
season, to attempt bringing about a reconciliation between the parties, for=
 the general good of the=20

king and kingdom; but these lords, in truth, could not effect this, though =
they signified to our=20

opponent the king=E2=80=99s commands,=E2=80=94but he contended that he woul=
d not wait upon his sovereign until=20

he should be sent for by the king himself.  =E2=80=98When the aforesaid lor=
ds advised him to obey the=20

king=E2=80=99s commands, they could scarcely obtain from him a promise not =
to come to the king with a=20

great power of men at arms; and even then he delayed his coming for fifteen=
 days. Consider, my=20

lords, what sort of obedience this is, and what fatal consequences may ensu=
e from it. After the=20

conference at Amiens, what was his conduct? Why, he assembled so large a fo=
rce of men at=20

arms, that when he came to Paris, he seemed as if he would conquer the whol=
e kingdom.  =E2=80=98It is=20

true, indeed, that the king and the princes of his blood, hearing of this, =
collected a sufficient power=20

to provide a remedy. But when the king had commanded him, by especial messe=
ngers, not to=20

enter Paris with more than two hundred men at arms, he came accompanied by =
more than six=20

hundred, in direct opposition to the king=E2=80=99s orders.=E2=80=94On his =
arrival in Paris with so large a force, it=20

seemed to him that the king, queen, and other princes ought to act accordin=
g to his will; and for=20

certain, such was the state of affairs that notice. It is considered by som=
e to furnish presumptive=20

evidence for the medical jurist, and taken in connection with the nature an=
d situation of the wound=20

may often lead us to a positive opinion as to the question of the suicidal =
or homicidal nature of a=20

wound. The evidence from the direction of wounds is only furnished by incis=
ed and punctured=20

wounds, rarely by contused wounds. Suicidal incised wounds of the throat ar=
e almost always=20

directed from above downward and from left to right if the suicide be right=
-handed, and in the=20

same direction from right to left if the person be left-handed. Transverse =
wounds in this situation=20

without obliquity are also compatible with suicide, though perhaps more com=
mon in homicide,=20

while obliquely transverse wounds from above downward and from right to lef=
t in a right-handed=20

individual are indicative of their infliction by another. Homicidal incised=
 wounds of the neck inflicted=20

from behind or the right side, if the victim and assailant are right-handed=
, or from the left side if=20

they are left-handed, may have the same direction as similar suicidal wound=
s. Such a wound may=20

be inflicted by a murderer to deceive as to the cause of the wound by raisi=
ng the suspicion of=20

suicide. If an incised wound of the throat be inflicted by another from in =
front, then its direction is=20

usually the reverse of a similar self-inflicted wound.=20


_
court behaved courteously toward him, to appease his anger.  =E2=80=98O, go=
vernment of France! if thou=20

wilt suffer such things to pass with impunity, thou wilt soon have cause fo=
r lamentations. Our=20

adversary next caused all the barricadoes and defences round the king=E2=80=
=99s palace to be taken away,=20

that his wicked intentions, already begun, might be completed. Such deeds a=
re strong proofs of=20

subjects having evil designs against their king. It behoved him to have com=
e to other end beyond=20

the skin wound. In similar suicidal wounds at both angles of the wound the =
skin is the first and the=20

last part injured, and in such wounds the spine is seldom reached. It shoul=
d be borne in mind in=20

this connection that a given suicide may be ambidextrous and this fact may =
be unknown to the=20

friends of the deceased. This is especially the case in the use of the razo=
r from practice in=20

shaving, and the razor is the usual weapon used in such=20
