beauty. The residence portion of the city overlooks an extensive manufactur=
ing section which=20

claims the largest meat packing establishment in the west, the largest grai=

"The little wrens that build" had been safe enough. But what of these poor =
human nestlings?=20

"Shall I come and help loo to wind up loo thleds?" sang little Fay. "Oh, no=
, Missis Pussy, you'd bite=20

off our heads!" And Tony joined in with a shout: "Oh, no, Missis Pussy, you=
'd bite off our heads."=20

The voices died away, the children were coming downstairs.  Jan drank three=
 cups of tea and=20

crumbled one piece of bread and butter on her plate. The rest of the party =
were hungry and full of=20

adventures. Before she joined Earley little Fay had been to the village wit=
h Meg to buy tape, and=20

she had a great deal to say about this expedition. Meg saw that something w=
as troubling Jan, and=20

wondered if Mr. Ledgard had given her fresh news of Hugo. But Meg never ask=
ed questions or=20

worried people. She chattered to the children, and immediately after tea ca=
rried them off for the=20

usual washing of hands.  Jan went out into the hall; the door was open and =
the sunny spring=20

evening called to her. When she was miserable she always wanted to walk, an=
d she walked now;=20

swiftly down the drive she went and out along the road till she came to the=
 church, which stood at=20

the end of the village nearest to Wren's End.  She turned into the churchya=
rd, and up the broad=20

pathway between the graves to the west door.  Near the door was a square he=
adstone marking=20

the grave of Charles Considine Smith; and she paused beside it to read once=
 more the somewhat=20

strange inscription.  Under his name and age, cut deep in the moss-grown st=
one, were the words:=20

"_Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear._"  Ofte=
n before Jan had=20

wondered what could have caused Tranquil, his wife, to choose so strenuous =
an epitaph. Tranquil,=20

who had never stirred twenty miles from the place where she was born; whose=
 very name, so far=20

as they could gather, exemplified her life.  What secret menace had threate=
ned this "staid person,"=20

this prosperous shipper of sherry who, apparently, had spent the evening of=
 his life in observing=20

the habits of wrens.  Why should his gentle wife have thus commemorated his=
 fighting spirit?  Be=20

the reason what it might, Jan felt vaguely comforted. There was triumph as =
well as trust in the=20

words. Whatever it was that had threatened him, he had stood up to it. His =
wife knew this and was=20

proud.  Jan tried the heavy oak door and it yielded, and from the soft mild=
ness of the spring=20

evening, so full of happy sounds of innocent life, she passed into the grey=
 and sacred silence of=20

the church.  It was cold in the beautiful old fourteenth-century church, wi=
th that pervading smell of=20

badly-burning wood that is so often found in country churches till all atte=
mpt at heating ceases for=20

the summer. But nothing could mar the nobility of its austerely lovely arch=
itecture; the indefinable,=20

exquisite grace that soothes and penetrates.  She went and knelt in the Wre=
n's End pew where=20

Charles Considine Smith's vast prayer-book still stood on the book-board. A=
nd even as in the=20

Bombay Cathedral she had prayed that strength might be given to her to walk=
 in the Way, so now=20

she prayed for courage and a quiet, steadfast mind.  Her head was bowed and=
 buried in her=20

hands: "_My heart shall not fear_," she whispered; but she knew that it did=
 fear, and fear=20

grievously.  The tense silence was broken by an odd, fitful, pattering soun=
d; but Jan, absorbed in=20

her petition for the courage she could not feel, heard nothing.  Something =
clumsy, warm, and=20

panting pushed against her, and she uncovered her face and looked down upon=
 William trying to=20

thrust his head under her arm and join in her devotions.  And William becam=
e a misty blur, for her=20

eyes filled with tears; he looked so anxious and foolish and kind with his =
tongue hanging out and=20

his absurd, puzzled expression.  He was puzzled. Part of the usual ritual h=
ad been omitted.  She=20



ought, by all known precedents, to have put her arm round his neck and have=
 admonished him to=20

"pray for his Master." But she did nothing of the kind, only patted him, wi=
th no sort of invitation to=20

join in her orisons.  William was sure something was wrong somewhere.  Then=
 Jan saw=20


_
prairies dotted with lakes and covered with groves of oak trees; or southea=
st into the famous=20

Puyallup Valley fruit and berry district. Its improved parks comprise 1,120=
 acres, 640 of which=20

constitute Point Defiance park at northern extremity of peninsula, and 30 a=
cres, Wright Park in=20

Other remarkable features=20

are a natural amphitheater or stadium, seating 38,000 people; the highest l=
ift bridge in the world in=20

his indoor strap shoes; and he was regarding her with grave, understanding =
eyes.  In a moment=20

she was back in the present and vividly alive to the fact that here was chi=
lly, delicate Tony out after=20

tea, without a coat and sitting in an ice-cold church.  She rose from her k=
nees, much to William's=20

satisfaction, who did not care for religious services in which he might not=
 take an active part. He=20

trotted out of the pew and Jan followed him, stooping to kiss Tony as she p=

hurried into the road.=20

"I saw you going down the drive from the bathroom window, and so I runned a=
fter you, and William=20

came too."  "But what made you come after me?"  "Because I thought you look=
ed frightened, and I=20

didn't like it; you looked like Mummy did sometimes."  No one who has seen =
fear stamped upon a=20

woman's face ever forgets it. Tony had watched his aunt all tea-time, and t=
his quite new=20

expression troubled him. Mummy had always seemed to want him when she looke=
d like that;=20

perhaps Auntie Jan would want him too. The moment his hands were dried he h=
ad rushed past=20

Meg and down the stairs with William in his wake. Meg had not tried to stop=
 him, for she, too,=20

realised that something worried Jan, and she knew that already there had ar=
isen an almost=20

unconscious _entente_ between these two. But she had no idea that he had go=
ne out of doors.=20

 said, "I used to feel=20

frightened inside, but I wouldn't let him know it, and then--it was funny--=

ick-witted and easily=20

interested. And she decided there and then that to keep them good she must =
keep them well=20

amused, and it acted like a charm.  She had the somewhat rare power of surr=
ounding quite=20

ordinary everyday proceedings with a halo of romance, so that the children'=
s day developed into a=20
