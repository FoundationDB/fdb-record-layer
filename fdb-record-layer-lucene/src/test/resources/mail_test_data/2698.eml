number or rub oil on and let dust accumulate until it would have been all but indecipherable. Then, 

too, persons seldom notice the number on a car unless there has been some accident.  "It just 

seems to have disappeared," declared Cora at the close of the day, when a long tour and many 

inquiries had resulted in nothing. "I just wish I had hold of those two fellows!"  "It _is_ provoking," 

agreed Belle. "Let's stop at the tea room and see if they've heard anything more there."  The girl at 

the cash register, the young lady manager, and the colored maid who had waited on them before 

greeted the three pretty chums smilingly as they again entered the pleasant tea room of Ye Olde 

Spinning Wheel.  "Were your tickets for the play all right?" asked Cora as the manager stepped 

over to inquire if everything was to their liking.  "I haven't used them yet. They are for this week 

Friday. Oh! I'm sure they're all right. Some of my friends bought tickets from the same fellows for 

the same night and they are next mine."  "Those chaps must have planned for a regular theatre 

party," observed Belle.  "Have you had any trace of your Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,

went up to pay the check.  "No, I'm sorry to say, I haven't."  "If you don't get it soon, Cora," said 

Belle, "you'd better plan to use ours to go to Camp Surprise."  "Oh, we're going in the motor boat," 

Cora said. "I didn't tell you, but mother learned that the roads around the camp were so rough that 

it would certainly spoil a car to take it to camp, so I wouldn't take mine, anyhow."  "Camp 

Surprise," repeated the pretty cashier. "That sounds deductible, and don't have the staff to handle

talked over at length, and an earlier trip than the one originally decided on had been voted for.

she cried, blushing. "Of course you want it back----"  "Well, I should say I do!" exclaimed Jack's 

sister with mock indignation.  "I mean we won't have to wait until you get your car back before 

going to Camp Surprise," Bess went on.  "No," agreed Cora. "That won't delay us."  "And now
