followed by Meg knitting busily, as they came through the yew archway on to=
 the lawn.  Meg=20

subsided into one of the white seats, but the children processed solemnly r=
ound, pausing under=20

Jan's window.  "I know lots an' lots of Clipture," her niece's voice procla=
imed proudly as she sat=20

down heavily in her wheelbarrow on the top of some garden produce she had c=
ollected.  "How=20

much do you know?" Tony asked sceptically.  "Oh, lots an' lots, all about p=
oor little Jophez in the=20

bullushes, and his instasting dleams."  "Twasn't Jophez," Tony corrected. "=
It was Mophez in the=20

bulrushes, and he didn't have no dreams. That was Jophez."  "How d'you know=
," Fay persisted,=20

"that poor little Mophez had no dleams? Why _shouldn't_ he have dleams same=
 as Jophez?"  "It=20

doesn't say so."  "It doesn't say he _didn't_ have dleams. He _had_ dleams,=
 I tell you; I know he=20

had. Muts nicer dleams van Jophez."  "Let's ask Meg; she'll know."  Jan gav=
e a sigh of relief. The=20

children had not noticed her, and Meg had a fertile mind.  The wheelbarrows=
 were trundled across=20

the lawn and paused in front of Meg, while a lively duet demanded simultane=
ously:=20

dleams?"   {"_Didn't_ deah littoo Mophez have dleams?"  When Meg had disent=
angled the=20

questions and each child sat down in a wheelbarrow at her feet, she remarke=
d judicially: "Well,=20

there's nothing said about little Moses' dreams, certainly; but I should th=
ink it's quite likely the poor=20

baby did have dreams."  "What sort of dleams? Nicer van sheaves and sings, =
wasn't they?"  "I=20

should think," Meg said thoughtfully, "that he dreamed he must cry very qui=
etly lest the Egyptians=20

should hear him."  "Deah littoo Mophez ... and what nelse?"  Meg was tempte=
d and fell. It was=20

very easy for her to invent "dleams" for "deah littoo Mophez" lying in his =
bulrush ark among the=20

flags at the river's edge. And, wholly regardless of geography, she transpo=
rted him to the Amber,=20

where the flags were almost in bloom at that moment, such local colour addi=
ng much to the=20

realism of her stories.  Presently William grew restless. He ran to Anthony=
's Venetian gate in the=20

yew hedge and squealed (William never whined) to get out. Tony let him out,=
 and he fled down the=20

drive to meet his master, who had come a good half-hour too soon for tea.  =
Jan continued to try=20

Massacre of the turn. When he had completely ruined the knees of his trouse=
rs he arose and=20

declared it was time to play "Here we go round the mulberry-bush," and it s=
o happened that once=20

or twice he played it hand-in-hand with Meg.  Jan left her letters and went=
 out.  The situation=20

puzzled her. She feared for Meg's peace of mind, for Captain Middleton was =
undoubtedly=20

attractive; and then she found herself fearing for his.  After tea and more=
 games with the children=20

Captain Middleton escorted his hostess to church, where he joined his aunt =
in the Manor seat.=20

During church Jan found herself wondering uneasily:  "Was everybody going t=
o fall in love with=20

Meg?"  "Would Peter?"  "What a disagreeable idea!"  And yet, why should it =
be?  Resolutely she=20

told herself that Peter was at perfect liberty to fall in love with Meg if =
he liked, and set herself to=20

listen intelligently to the Vicar's sermon.         *       *       *      =
 *       *  Meg started to put her=20

children to bed, only to find that her fertility of imagination in the afte=
rnoon was to prove her=20

undoing in the evening; for her memory was by no means as reliable as her p=
owers of invention.=20

Little Fay urgently demanded the whole cycle of little Mophez' dleams over =
again. And for the life=20

of her Meg couldn't remember them either in their proper substance or seque=
nce--and this in spite=20

of the most persistent prompting,=20
