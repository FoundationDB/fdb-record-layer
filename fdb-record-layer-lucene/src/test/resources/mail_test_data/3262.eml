r prominently _
translators of the Bible, friend of Lord Burleigh; the other was John Willi=
ams, who in his earlier=20

days was twice committed to the Tower, once by the King, and once by the Pa=
rliament, who=20

defended the Castle of Conway against the army of the Commonwealth, and who=
 now after his=20

stormy life reposes in the lovely church of Llandegai, the last ecclesiasti=
cal Lord Keeper of Great=20

Britain.  But there is a more general influence which has left its permanen=
t mark on England.=20

Within that old cathedral of St. David, of which I just now spoke, the most=
 conspicuous tomb which=20

rises in the midst of it, and which, according to the tradition of the plac=
e, saved the cathedral itself=20

from destruction, is that of Edmund Tudor, father of Henry VII. and grandfa=
ther of Henry VIII., who,=20

for its sake, spared the venerable church where it stands.  This very churc=
h of Holyhead was in=20

great part rebuilt in the time of Henry VII. son of that Edmund Tudor.  The=
 rose of the Tudor family=20

is visible to this day on its walls.  Owen Tudor, the ancestor of them all,=
 was a native of this island=20

of Anglesey.  We are thus reminded of the fact, which we sometimes forget, =
that, after Saxon and=20

Norman and Plantagenet had done their best and passed away, a Welsh and Bri=
tish dynasty at=20

last was seated once more on the throne of Britain, and swayed the destinie=
s of the whole empire.=20

When in Westminster Abbey we pass from the tombs of the earlier kings to th=
e magnificent chapel=20

of King Henry VII., it is a striking thought to any one, especially to any =
one who has a drop of the=20

ancient Welsh blood in his veins, that he enters there on a new field of th=
e history of England,=20

inaugurated by a succession of princes whose boast it was to be descended, =
not from Edward the=20

Confessor or William the Conqueror, but from Arthur and Llewellyn, and that=
 about the tomb of the=20

first Tudor sovereign, intertwined with the emblems of his English descent,=
 is to be seen the Red=20

Dragon of Cadwallader.  That Tudor race, in their quick understanding, in t=
heir fiery temper, the=20

true representatives of their ancient Celtic lineage, were the instruments =
raised up by God=E2=80=99s=20

providence at the critical season of the new birth of England in the Reform=
ation, for guiding,=20

stimulating, freshening the Church and the nation to the performance of new=
 duties, the fulfilment=20

of new hopes, the application of new truths.  The sharpness of wit and live=
liness of mind which=20

were amongst the precocious gifts of Henry and Edward and Elizabeth, were c=
ommon to them=20

with their Welsh ancestors, and contributed in no small degree to the fresh=
 start which England=20

then made in the movements of that moving age. These qualities, whenever fo=
und, though they=20

are not the highest of gifts, are inestimable for enlivening, cheering, enk=
indling the more powerful=20

and the more highly civilised to action and to enquiry.  Cherish them, even=
 if they sometimes=20

outrun discretion; correct them, if so be, not by repressing them, but by s=
triving to develop the=20

opposite gifts which are needed to balance and to chasten them.  II.  And t=
his leads us to two=20

general remarks in conclusion.  (1)  First let us remember that these grace=
s of the Cambrian or=20

Celtic character, which our Heavenly Father has thus vouchsafed to us, are =
also by His good=20

providence blended in the English race with exactly those qualities which f=
urnish their=20

counterpoise=E2=80=94with that self-control, that moral discipline, that so=
lid steadiness of purpose, without=20

which poetic sentiment, religious fervour, mental vivacity are often useles=
s, or worse than useless.=20

The old hermit in his solitude, the preacher in his fervid appeal, was good=
; but the honest, manly=20

Christian, doing his duty faithfully and truthfully in his own station of l=
ife, is better.  The sailor who=20

remembers on the broad sea that God=E2=80=99s eye is always upon him; the w=
orkman or tradesman who=20

endeavours to render to his Maker the best of all services, the offering of=
 honest labour, the=20

offering of unadulterated food, the offering of an upright conscientious tr=
affic; the railway official or=20
