 It was soon after the deer season opened, they tell me, and Bauby was supp=
orted to the door by her subordinates, imploring her all the way to keep up=
 her heart. "You'll no' let on to the strange gentleman." "Ye'll keep up a =

t either hand. There was a great deal of struggling outside the door, and s=
ome stifled sounds of weeping, before it _
the porch. She had kicked off the snowshoes and the hermit had taken them w=
ith him. Had it not=20

been for the hermit and Fred Hatfield, Ruth Fielding would never have been =
able to travel the=20

distance from the hermit's cabin to Snow Camp. And the terrible shaking up =
she had received on=20

the timber cart made her feel like singing old Aunt Alvirah's tune of "Oh, =
my back and oh, my=20

bones!"  There were two maids whom Mr. Cameron had brought along and they, =
with two men,=20

had come over from Scarboro (a ride of eight miles, or so) with the luggage=
. They welcomed Ruth=20

and set her down before a great fire in the dining room, and one of them re=
moved the girl's shoes=20

so that her feet might be dried and warmed, while the other hurried to make=
 some supper for the=20

wanderer.  But as soon as Ruth got her slippers on, and recovered a little =
from the exhaustion of=20

her trip, two things troubled her vastly. She inquired for the boy again, a=
nd learned that he had not=20

been seen about the camp. When she and the hermit had entered the clearing,=
 Fred had=20

undoubtedly taken the opportunity to slip away.  "And in the night--and it =
so cold, too," thought=20

Ruth. "What will Mr. Cameron say?"  That question brought her to the second=
 of her troubles. Her=20

friends would worry about her all night if she did not find some way of all=
aying their anxiety.  "Oh,=20

Mary!" she said to the maid. "Where's the telephone? Tom said there was tel=
ephone connection=20

here."  "So there is, Miss," returned the maid. "And somebody had better te=
ll Mrs. Murchiston that=20

you're safe. They're all as worried as they can be about you, for the folks=
 at that store by the=20

railroad--where the train stopped--when _they_ was called up as soon as the=
 train reached=20

Scarboro, declared that you had got run away with by a team of mules."  "Wh=
ich was most=20

certainly true," admitted Ruth. "I never had such a dreadful time in all my=
 life. Run away with by=20

mules, and frightened to death by a great big catamount----"  Mary squealed=
 and covered her=20

ears. "Don't tell me!" she gasped. "Sure, Miss, there do bes bears, an' pan=
thers, an' wild-cats, an'--=20

an' I dunno what-all in these woods. Sure, me and Janey will never go out o=
f this house whilst we=20

stay. 'Tain't civilized hereabout."  Ruth laughed rather ruefully. "I guess=
 you're right, Mary," she=20

said. "It doesn't seem to be very civilized here in the backwoods-- and suc=
h queer people live=20

here, too. But now! let me telephone."  The maid showed her where it was an=
d Ruth called up=20

Scarboro and got the hotel where the Cameron party was stopping. Almost imm=
ediately she heard=20

Mr. Cameron's voice.  "Hullo! Snow Camp? What's wanted?" he asked, in a ner=
vous, jerky way.=20

"This is me, Mr. more holding out his hand.  There was nobody visible on th=
e road, up or down.=20

The turrets of Lindores peeped over the trees in the distance, like spectat=
ors deeply interested,=20

holding their breath; at the other end the long thin tower of the Town Hous=
e seemed to pale away=20

into the distance. He looked anxiously into her face, as if life and death =
hung on the decision. They=20

had come to a standstill in the emotion of the moment, and stood facing eac=
h other, trembling with=20

the same sentiment. Nora held back still, but there was an instinctive draw=
ing closer of the two=20

figures--irresistible, involuntary.  "Your father will never consent," she =
said, with an unsteady voice;=20

"and my father will never allow it against his will. But, Lord Rintoul----"=
  "Not lord, nor Rintoul," he=20

said.  "You never liked to be called Robin," Nora said, with a half malicio=
us glance into his face.=20

But poor Rintoul was not in the humour for jest. He took her hand, her arm,=
 and drew it through=20

his.  "I cannot wait to think about our fathers. I have such need of you, N=
ora. I have something to=20

tell you that I can tell to no one in the world but you. I want my other se=
lf to help me. I want my=20

wife, to whom I can speak----"  His arm was quivering with anxiety and emot=
ion. Though Nora was=20

bewildered, she did not hesitate--what girl would?--from the responsibility=
 thus thrust upon her. To=20



be so urgently wanted is the strongest claim that can be put forth upon any=
 human creature.=20

Instinctively she gave his arm a little pressure, supporting rather than su=
pported, and said "Tell=20

me," turning upon him freely, without blush or faltering, the grave sweet f=
ace of sustaining love.=20

CHAPTER XXXIX.   Rolls disappeared on the evening of the day on which he ha=
d that long=20

consultation with Mr Monypenny. He did not return to Dalrulzian that night.=
 Marget, with many=20

blushes and no small excitement, served the dinner, which Bauby might be sa=
id to have cooked=20

with tears. If these salt drops were kept out of her sauces, she bedewed th=
e white apron which=20

she lifted constantly to her eyes. "Maister John in jyal! and oor Tammas go=
ne after him; and what=20

will I say to his mammaw?" Bauby cried. She seemed to fear that it might be=
 supposed some want=20

of care on her part which had led to this dreadful result. But even the sor=
row of her soul did not=20

interfere with her sense of what was due to her master's guest. Beaufort's =
dinner did not suffer,=20

whatever else might. It was scrupulously cooked, and served with all the ca=
re of which Marget was=20

capable; and when it was all over, and everything carefully put aside, the =
women sat down=20

together in the kitchen, and had a good cry over the desolation of the hous=
e.=20


_
Camp."  "Well! That's fine! Thank goodness you're safe!" ejaculated the mer=
chant, in an entirely=20

different tone. "Why, Ruth, I was just about sending a party out from the s=
tore at Emoryville to beat=20

up the woods for you. They say there is a big panther in that district."  "=
Oh, I know it. The beast=20

frightened us most to death--"  "Who was with you?" interrupted Mr. Cameron=
.  "Why, that boy! He=20

jumped off the train and I followed to stop him. Now he's run away again, s=
ir."  "Oh, the boy calling=20

himself Fred Hatfield?" ejaculated Mr. Cameron. "He's left you?"  "He came =
here to Snow Camp=20

and then disappeared. I concerned on this point as Bauby, who was an old se=
rvant, and=20

considered Dalrulzian as her home: but they were all more or less affected =
by the disgrace, as well=20

as sorry for the young master, who had "nae pride," and always a pleasant w=
ord for his attendants=20

in whatever capacity. Their minds were greatly affected, too, by the absenc=
e of Rolls. Not a man in=20

the house but the stranger gentleman! It was a state of affairs which alarm=
ed and depressed them,=20

and proved, above all other signs, that a great catastrophe had happened. B=
eaufort sent for the=20

housekeeper after dinner to give her such information as he=20
