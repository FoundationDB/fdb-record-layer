companions received him with the greatest joy.  As the rainy season was ove=
r at the end of=20

October, the moment for visiting Tuzulatlan was favourable, and Las Casas d=
etermined to go=20

himself and visit the newly converted cacique.  It was December when he and=
 Fray Pedro de=20

Angulo arrived in the Quiche country, where the cacique, who since his bapt=
ism was known as=20

Don Juan, showed them the same hospitality as he had to Fray Luis.  While s=
ome of the Indians=20

received them as messengers bringing glad tidings, there were others who ca=
st epicurean glances=20

upon them and decided that they would taste well served with a sauce of chi=
li. (49)  The=20

introduction of the new religion had not been effected without opposition a=
nd the Indians of Coban=20

had even burned the first church. Another was soon built, however, in which=
 the two friars said=20

mass daily, preaching afterwards in the open air to immense assemblies of p=
eople.  Don Juan was=20

at first unwilling that the friars should penetrate farther into the countr=
y, fearing that some of the=20

people, who adhered to the old customs and were hostile to the Spaniards mi=
ght attack them, but=20

he finally withdrew his objections and formed a guard of his bravest warrio=
rs, to whom he confided=20

the safety of his guests.  Thus escorted, they traversed all the to him by =
his gifts, and he thought=20

he had earned the right by his liberality to meet the recipient with roughn=
ess or arrogance,=20

according to his humor.  Thus it happened that his best actions procured hi=
m not friends but=20

enemies.  Paaker's was, in fact, an ignoble, that is to say, a selfish natu=
re; to shorten his road he=20

trod down flowers as readily as he marched over the sand of the desert.  Th=
is characteristic=20

marked him in all things, even in his outward demeanor; in the sound of his=
 voice, in his broad=20

features, in the swaggering gait of his stumpy figure.  In camp he could co=
nduct himself as he=20

pleased; but this was not permissible in the society of his equals in rank;=
 for this reason, and=20

because those faculties of quick remark and repartee, which distinguished t=
hem, had been denied=20

to him, he felt uneasy and out of his element when he mixed with them, and =
he would hardly have=20

accepted Ameni's invitation, if it had not so greatly flattered his vanity.=
  It was already late; but the=20

banquet did not begin till midnight, for the guests, before it began, assis=
ted at the play which was=20

performed by lamp and torch-light on the sacred lake in the south of the Ne=
cropolis, and which=20

represented the history of Isis and Osiris.  When he entered the decorated =
hall in which the=20

to the cacique's apprehensions, they encountered only the most friendly tre=
atment.  At this=20

juncture a Bull of Paul III. (Farnese) which was designed to put an end to =
further disputes=20

concerning the status of the Indians, by defining their rights once for all=
, arrived in America. (50)=20

This Bull was issued in reply to letters sent to the Pope by the Bishop of =
Tlascala, begging his=20

Holiness to decide the vexed question of the status found all the guests as=
sembled.  The Regent=20

Ani was present, and sat on Ameni's right at the top of the centre high-tab=

places were unoccupied; for the prophets and the initiated of the temple of=
 Amon had excused=20

themselves from being present.  They were faithful to Rameses and his house=
; their grey-haired=20
