masterpieces all the way to Philadelphia for his "Uncle Peter's" approval. =
It hurt me, for just one=20

foolish fraction of a second, to think my boy had confidences with an outsi=
der which he could not=20

have with his own mother. And then I remembered that Peter wasn't an outsid=
er. I realized how=20

much he had brought into my laddie's life, how much, in a different way, he=
 had brought into my=20

own. I even tried to tell him about this. But he stopped me short by saying=
 something in Latin=20

which he later explained meant "by taking the middle course we shall not go=
 amiss." So I came=20

back to Casa Grande, not exactly with a feeling of frustration, but with a =
feeling of possibilities=20

withheld and issues deferred. It was a companionable enough tramp, I suppos=
e. But I'm afraid I=20

was a disappointment to Peter. His gaiety impressed me as a bit forced. I a=
m slightly mystified by=20

his refusal, while taking serious things seriously, to take anything tragic=
ally. Even at tea, with all its=20

air of the valedictory hanging over us, he was nice and gay, like the Chris=
tmas beeves the city=20

butchers stick paper rosettes into, or the circus-band playing like mad whi=
le the tumbler who has=20

had a fall is being carried out to the dressing-tent. Peter even offhandedl=
y inquired, as he was=20

going, if he might have Scotty to take care of, provided it was not expedie=
nt to take Dinkie's dog=20

along to Calgary with us.... I'm not quite certain--I may be wrong, but the=
re are moments, odd=20

earthquakey moments, when I have a suspicion that Peter will be keeping mor=
e than Scotty after=20

we've trekked off to Calgary!     _Saturday the Fourth_   This tearing up o=
f roots is a much sorrier=20

business than I had imagined. And more difficult. I find it hard to know wh=
at to take and what to=20

leave behind. And there is so much to be thought of, so much to be arranged=
 for, so much to be=20

done. I have had to write Duncan and tell him I'll be a few days later than=
 I intended. My biggest=20

problem has been with Whinstane Sandy and Struthers. I called them in and h=
ad a talk with them=20

and told them I wanted them to keep Casa Grande going the same as ever. The=
n I made myself=20

into the god from the machine by calmly announcing the only way things coul=
d be arranged would=20

be for the two of them to get married.  Struthers, at this suggestion, prom=
ptly became as coy as a=20

partridge-hen. Whinnie, of course, remained Scottish and canny. He became m=
ore shrewdly=20

magnanimous, however, after we'd had a bit of talk by ourselves. "Weel, I'l=
l tak' the woman, rather=20

than see her frettin' hersel' to death!" he finally conceded, knowing only =
too well he'd nest warm=20

and live well for the rest of his days. He'd been his Sancho. The phrase is=
 not a happy one, since=20

Sancho is not the caricature but the counterfoil of Don Quixote; Don Quixot=
e being spirit without=20

sense and Sancho sense without spirit. Imperialism, if it could see itself,=
 is in fact a world of=20

Sanchos and it would not be the less so if every Sancho of the number were =
master of the whole=20

of physical science, and used it to cook his food. Of the two court poets o=
f Caesar's successor,=20

one makes Cato preside over the spirits of the good in the Elysian fields, =
while the other speaks=20

with respect, at all events, of the soul which remained unconquered in a co=
nquered world--"Et=20

cuneta terrarum subacta praeter atrocem animum Catonis." Paterculus, an off=
icer of Tiberius and=20

a thorough Caesarian, calls Cato a man of ideal virtue ("homo virtuti simil=
limus") who did right not=20

for appearance sake, but because it was not in his nature to do wrong. When=
 the victor is thus=20

overawed by the shade of the vanquished, the vanquished can hardly have bee=
n a "fool."=20

Contemporaries may be mistaken as to the merits of a character, but they ca=
nnot well be mistaken=20

as to the space which it occupied in their own eyes. Sallust, the partizan =
of Marius and Caesar,=20

who had so much reason to hate the senatorial party, speaks of Caesar and C=
ato as the two=20

mighty opposites of his time, and in an elaborate parallel ascribes to Caes=
ar the qualities which=20



secure the success of the adventurer; to Cato those which make up the chara=
cter of the patriot. It=20

is a mistake to regard Cato the younger as merely an unseasonable repetitio=
n of Cato the elder.=20

His inspiration came not from a Roman, but from a Greek school, which, with=
 all its errors and=20

absurdities, and in spite of the hypocrisy of many of its professors, reall=
y aimed highest in the=20

formation of character; and the practical teachings and aspirations of whic=
h, embodied in the=20

Reflections of Marcus Aurelius, it is impossible to study without profound =
respect for the force of=20

moral conception and the depth of moral insight which they sometimes displa=
y. Cato went to=20

Greece to sit at the feet of a Greek teacher in a spirit very different fro=
m the national pride of his=20

ancestor. It is this which makes his character interesting: it was an attem=
pt at all events to grasp=20

and hold fast a high rule of life in an age when the whole moral world was =
sinking in a vortex of=20

scoundrelism, and faith in morality, public or private, had been lost. Of c=
ourse the character is=20

formal, and in some respects even grotesque. But you may trace formalism, i=
f you look closely=20

enough, in every life led by a rule; in everything in fact between the pure=
st spiritual impulse on one=20

side and=20


_
hoping, he confessed to me, that some day he'd get back to that claim of hi=
s up in the Klondike.=20

But he wasn't so young as he once was. And perhaps Dinkie, when he was grow=
n to a man, could=20

go up and look after his rights. 'Twould be a grand journey, he averred wit=
h a sigh, for a high-

spirited lad turned twenty.  "I'll be stayin' with Pee-Wee and the old plac=
e here," concluded=20

Whinstane Sandy, giving me his rough old hand as a pledge. And with tears i=
n my eyes I lifted that=20

faithful old hand up to my lips and kissed it. Whinnie, I knew, would die f=
or me. But he would pass=20

away before he'd be willing to put his loyalty and his courage and his kind=
-heartedness into pretty=20

speeches. Struthers, on the other hand, has become too flighty to be of muc=
h use to me in my=20

packing. She has plunged headlong into a riot of baking, has sent for a fre=
sh supply of sage tea,=20

and is secretly perusing a dog-eared volume which I have reason to know is =
_The Marriage=20

Guide_.  Gershom, all things considered, is the most dolorous member of our=
 home circle. He=20

says little, but inspects me with the wounded eyes of a neglected spaniel. =
He will stay on at Casa=20

Grande until the Easter holidays, and then migrate to the Teetzels'. As for=
 Dinkie and Poppsy, they=20

are too young to understand. The thought of change excites them, but they h=
ave no idea of what=20

they are leaving behind.  Last night, when I was dog-tired after my long da=
y's work, I remembered=20

about Dinkie's school-essays and took them out to read. And having done so,=
 I realized there was=20

something sacred about them. They gave me a glimpse of a groping young soul=
 reaching up=20

toward the light.  "We have a Flag," I read, "to thrill our bones and be pr=
od of and no man boy=20

woman or girl" (and the not altogether artless _diminuendo_ did not escape =
me!) "should never let=20

it drag in the dust. It flotes at the bow of our ships and waves from the t=
op of most post offices etc.=20

And now we have a flag and a flag staf in front of our school and on holday=
s and when every grate=20

man dies we put said flag up at haf mast.... It is the flag of the rich and=
 the poor, the flag of our=20

country which all of whose citizens have a right to fly, the hig" (obviousl=
y meant for _high_) "and=20

the low, the rich and the poor. And we must not only keep our flag but blaz=
en it still further with=20

deeds nobely done. If ever you have to shed your blood for your country rem=
eber its for the=20

nobelest flag that flies the same being an emblen of our native land to whi=
ch it represens and=20

stands in high esteem by the whole people of a country." ... God bless his =
patriotic little bones! My=20

bairn knew what he was trying to get at, but it's plain he didn't quite kno=
w how to get there.  But=20

the drama of the Capture of Quebec plainly put him on easier ground. For he=
re was a story worth=20

the telling. And what could be more glorious than the death of Wolfe as I s=
ee it through my little=20

Dinkie's eyes?  For I read: "The french said Wolfe" (_can_ has first been w=
ritten and then=20

scratched out and _would_ substituted) "never get up that rivver but Wolfe =
fooled them with a trick=20

by running the french flag up on his shipps so the french pilots without fe=
ar padled out and come=20

abord when Wolfe took them prissoners and made them pilot the english ships=
 safe to the iland of=20

Orlens. He wanted to capsture the city of Quebec without distroiting it. Bu=
t the clifs were to high=20

and the brave Montcalm dified Wolfe who lost 400 men and got word Amherst c=
ould not come and=20

so himself took sick and went to bed. But a desserter from the french gave =
Wolfe the pass word=20

and when his ships crept further up the rivver in the dark a french senntry=
 called out qui vive and=20

one of Wolfe's men who spoke french well ansered la france and the senntry =
said to himself they=20

was french ships and let them go on. Next day Wolfe was better and saw a go=
at clime up the clifs=20

near the plains of Abraham and said where a goat could go he could go to. S=
o he forgot being sick=20

and desided to clime up Wolfe's cove which was not then called that until l=
ater. It was a dark night=20



and they went in row boats with all the oars mufled. It was a formadible si=
ght that would have=20

made even bolder men shrink with fear. But it was the brave Higlanders who =
lead with their=20

muskits straped to their sholdiers climing up the steep rock by grabbing at=
 roots of trees and=20

shrubbs and not a word was wispered but the french senntrys saw the tree mo=
ving and asked qui=20

vive sensuality on the other.  Attempts to revive old Roman simplicity of d=
ress and habits in the=20

age of Lucullus, were no doubt futile enough: yet this is only the symbolic=
al garb of the Hebrew=20

prophet. The scene is in ancient Rome, not in the smoking-room of the House=
 of Commons. The=20

character as painted by Plutarch, who seems to have drawn from the writings=
 of contemporaries,=20

is hard of course, but not cynical. Cato was devoted to his brother Caepio,=
 and when Caepio died,=20

forgot all his Stoicism in the passionate indulgence of his grief, and all =
his frugality in lavishing gold=20

and perfumes on the funeral. Caesar in "Anti-Cato" accused him of sifting t=
he ashes for the gold,=20

which, says Plutarch, is like charging Hercules with cowardice. Where the s=
ensual appetites are=20

repressed, whatever may be the theory of life, the affections are pretty su=
re to be strong, unless=20

they are nipped by some such process as is undergone by a monk. Cato's resi=
gnation of his=20

fruitful wife to a childless friend, revolting as it is to our sense, betok=
ens not so much brutality in=20

him as coarseness of the conjugal relations at Rome. Evidently the man had =
the power of touching=20

the hearts of others. His soldiers, though he has given them no largesses, =
and indulged them in no=20

license, when he leaves them, strew their garments under his feet. His frie=
nds at Utica linger at the=20

peril of their lives to give him a sumptuous funeral. He affected convivial=
ity like Socrates. He=20

seems to have been able to enjoy a joke too at his own expense. He can laug=
h when Cicero=20

ridicules his Stoicism in a speech; and when in a province he meets the inh=
abitants of a town=20

turning out, and thinks at first that it is in his own honour, but soon fin=
ds that it is in honour of a=20

much greater man, the confidential servant of Pompey, at first his dignity =
is outraged, but his anger=20

soon gives place to amusement. That his public character was perfectly pure=
, no one seems to=20

have doubted; and there is a kindliness in his dealings with the dependants=
 of Rome which shews=20

that had he been an emperor he would have been such an emperor as Trajan--a=
 man whom he=20

probably resembled, both in the goodness of his intentions and in the limit=
ed powers of his mind.=20

Impracticable, of course, in a certain sense he was; but his part was that =
of a reformer, and to=20

compromise with the corruption against which he was contending would have b=
een to lose the=20

only means of influence, which, having no military force and no party, he p=
ossessed--the=20

unquestioned integrity of his character. He is said by Dr. Mommsen to have =
been incapable of=20

even conceiving a policy. By policy I suppose is meant one of those brillia=
nt schemes of ambition=20

with which some literary men are fond of identifying themselves, fancying, =
it seems, that thereby=20

they themselves after their measure play the Caesar. The policy which Cato =
conceived was simply=20

that of purifying and preserving the Republic. So far, at all events, he ha=
d an insight into the=20

situation, that he knew the real malady of the State to be want of public s=
pirit, which he did his best=20

to supply. And the fact is, that he did more than once succeed in a remarka=
ble way in stemming=20

the tide of corruption. Though every instinct bade him struggle to the last=
, he had sense enough to=20

see the state of the case, and to advise that, to avert anarchy, supreme po=
wer should be put into=20

the hands of Pompey, whose political superstition, if not his loyalty, ther=
e was good reason to=20

trust. When at last civil war broke out, Cato went into it like Falkland, c=
rying "peace;" he set his=20

face steadily against the excesses and cruelties of his party; and when he =
saw the field of=20



Dyrrhaeium covered with his slain enemies, he covered his face and wept. He=
 wept a Roman over=20

Romans, but humanity will not refuse the tribute of his tears. After Pharsa=
lus he cherished no=20

illusion, as Dr Mommsen himself admits, and though he determined himself to=
 fall fighting, he=20

urged no one else to resistance: he felt that the duty of an ordinary citiz=
en was done. His terrible=20

march over the African desert shewed high powers of command, as we shall se=
e by comparing it=20

with the desert march of Napoleon. Dr. Mommsen ridicules his pedantry in re=
fusing, on grounds of=20

loyalty, to take the commandership-in-chief over the head of a superior in =
rank. Cato was fighting=20

for legality, and the spirit of legality was the soul of his cause. But bes=
ides this, he was himself=20

without=20


_
hard and lernt french said la france as he had done before and they got saf=
e to the top and faced=20

the city. At brake of day they stood face to face, french and english. But =
Montcalm marched out to=20

cut them off there and Wolfe lined his men up in a line and said hold your =
fire until they are within=20

forty paces away from us. The french caused many causilties but the english=
 never wavered.=20

Montcalm still on horse back reseaved a mortal real control. He remained ma=
ster to the last of the=20

burning vessel. Our morality will not approve of his voluntary death; but t=
hen our morality would=20

give him a sufficient motive for living, even if he was to be bound to the =
car of the conqueror.=20

Looking to Roman opinion, he probably did what honour dictated; and those w=
ho prefer honour to=20

life are not so numerous that we can afford to speak of them with scorn. "T=
he fool," says Dr=20


_
granadeers hadn't held him up and Wolfe too was shot on the wirst but went =
right on. Again he=20

was shot this time more fataly and as they were laying him down one of the =
men exclaimed See=20

how they run. Who run murmurred the dieing Wolfe. The enemy sir replied the=
 man. Then I die=20

happy said Generral Wolfe and with a great sigh rolled over on his side and=
 died.... And when the=20

doctor told Montcalm he could only live a few hours he said God be prased I=
 shall not live to see=20

Quebec fall. Brave words like those death--"The fool spoke the Epilogue" Wh=
ether Cato was a fool=20

or not, it was not he that spoke the Epilogue. The Epilogue was spoken by M=
arcus Aurelius,=20

whose principles, political as well as philosophical, were identical with t=
hose for which Cato gave=20

his life. All that time the Stoic and Republican party lived, sustained by =
the memory of its martyrs,=20

and above them all by that of Cato. At first it struggled against the Empir=
e; at last it accepted it,=20

and when the world was weary of Caesars, assumed the=20


_
just as brave. No more fiting words could be said by anybody than those he =
said in the boats with=20

the mufled oars that night that the paths of glory leed but to the grave." =
...  I have folded up the=20

carefully written pages, reverently, remembering my promise to return them =
to Peter. But for a=20

while at least I shall keep them with me. They have set me thinking, remind=
ing me how time flies.=20

Here is my little boy, grown into an historian, sagely philosophizing over =
the tragedies of life. My=20

wee laddie, expressing himself through the recorded word.... It seems such =
a short time=20

Antonines. The doctrine of continuity is valid for all parties alike, and t=
he current of public virtue=20

was not cut off by Pharsalus. On the whole, remote as the character of Cato=
 is in some respects=20

from our sympathies, absurd as it would be if taken as a model for our imit=
ation, I recognise it as a=20

proof of the reality and indestructibility of moral force, even when pitted=
 against the masters of=20

thirty legions.  Against Cicero, again, Dr. Mommsen is so bitter, he is so =
determined to suppress=20

as well as to degrade him, that it would be difficult even to make out from=
 his=20
