rocks a dusky grot     Where never sunshine fell. A dismal spot     Where d=

round her neck a scarf of=20

amber. Wide     Its smooth folds sweeping flowed; and proud he cried,     "=

her eyes a swift delight,     And low she cried, "Oh, wondrous is the sight=

me. But yet," she said,     "Beside my knee one morn, its hooded head     A=

enderly     She smoothed the=20

gleaming folds. "Much pleaseth me,     Natlhess," she said, "such lovelines=
s." Then brought     He=20

Of dropping leaves. "Lilith," he said, "when rolled     The storm-tossed bi=

The =E2=80=9CPopular Reflector,=E2=80=9D with 5-1/4 inch speculum of 5, 5-1=
/2, to 6 feet focus, will be found very=20

suitable, and if its illuminating power is not greater than a 4-1/2 inch re=
fractor, its defining and=20

dividing powers are superior. By choosing the above focal lengths, accordin=
g to circumstances,=20

the observer can reach the eye-tube, while standing erect for objects in th=
e zenith, and it is a great=20

mistake to suppose that the shorter the tube the more handy it becomes. The=
se foci will not=20

require a =E2=80=9CBarlow=E2=80=9D lens to flatten the field. The =E2=80=9C=
Barlow=E2=80=9D is very useful for short foci when the=20

aperture is considerable, as it improves the imperfect correction for spher=
ical error, but this is=20

much better corrected in the mirror itself than by a =E2=80=9CBarlow=E2=80=
=9D lens, which cannot be used without=20

more than one disadvantage. There must, by its insertion, be some loss of l=
ight, which can ill be=20

spared with small instruments, and when used to obtain magnifying power the=
re is some=20

disturbance of colour, and this subtracts from the beauty and purity of the=
 definition of a reflector.=20



There is _nothing_ equal to a good eye-piece to obtain _power_, and _flatne=
ss_ of field by the=20

_curve_ of the speculum.  With the =E2=80=9CPopular Reflector=E2=80=9D and =
an outlay of a few shillings on some=20

popular books, such as the excellent work =E2=80=9CCelestial Objects,=E2=80=
=9D by the Rev. T. W. Webb, and some=20

first-class publications by Mr. R. A. Proctor, especially his smaller star =
atlas, &c., the amateur can=20

compare the work he is then capable of doing with a large and expensive ref=
ractor which might be=20

beyond his reach.         THE ADJUSTMENTS OF THE EQUATORIAL.  When the inex=
perienced=20

amateur purchases an equatorial with circles, he should not be without the =
third edition of=20

=E2=80=9CChamber=E2=80=99s Handbook of Descriptive Astronomy,=E2=80=9D whic=
h, besides being an excellent book in other=20

respects, is a really practical guide to the use and application of the Equ=
atorial, and is=20

indispensable to the beginner. He will there find the fullest details of th=
e adjustments to any degree=20

of exactness. Besides many other matters he will be instructed in the use a=
nd application of=20

apparatus to the perfect Equatorial, including all kinds of eye-pieces, mic=
rometers, &c., &c., as=20

well as other optical instruments and accessories.  The Equatorials describ=
ed in this catalogue are=20

provided with every means of adjustment. The cradle contains powerful screw=
s to set the line of=20

sight at right angles to the declination axis, and shifting screws to place=
 the polar axis in the=20

meridian and to the correct elevation, and with care and a few experiments =
with the adjustments,=20

and by observations of some catalogue stars, the various adjustments will s=
oon be correctly made,=20

and the verniers set accordingly.         THE CASSEGRAIN.  This is a form o=
f reflecting telescope=20

but little known. This is rather strange, since it is a very much better pr=
inciple than the =E2=80=9CGregorian,=E2=80=9D=20

so well known to the old observers. Herschel says it admits of a theoretica=
lly perfect telescope.=20

Compared with the =E2=80=9CNewtonian=E2=80=9D it has its advantages and dis=
advantages.=20


_
She said, "is Eblis, unto whom I fain     Would give due thanks. His gorgeo=

I saw the peacock spread;     Bright in the sun gleamed his small crested h=
ead;     His haughty=20

advantages are, first, the=20

shortening of the tube, which in large telescopes is sometimes very importa=
nt. Secondly, the=20

observer has not to _ascend_ to the eye-tube, the observations being made a=
t the lower end, as=20

with a refractor. The =E2=80=9CCassegrain=E2=80=9D has a flatter field of=

Not color rich as his: and I have seen     The curious nest among the branc=
hes green,     The busy=20

aves;     And since thou=20

sayest 'twere hard to match thy fine,     Strong, woven fabrics, watch the =
weaver twine     His=20

cunning wefts. Though still," she said, "think not     I scorn thy gifts, P=
rince Eblis; for I wot     Their=20

worth is greater than my tongue can say."       Then Eblis deeper in the ca=
ve led her a little way,=20

And showed a stately screen of such fine art     One almost felt the breeze=
 that seemed to part=20

The pictured boughs. And o'er the stirless lake     Dreamed the swift, wimp=
ling waters sudden=20

brake     Among the willows on its brink--and flowers     Of scarlet, shini=
ng-clean from summer=20

showers;     And Eblis said, "Cold praise a friend should spare     This pi=
cture true. Certain naught=20

else will dare     Vie with such beauty."                            causin=
g the rays to travel twice the=20

distance, and, adding the element of magnifying power, the eye-pieces need =
not be composed of=20

small lenses. The adjustments are perhaps a little more trouble, as the lin=
e of collimation must be=20

carefully attended to, this requiring only a little more care can soon be a=
ccomplished, and then the=20

definition of a good =E2=80=9CCassegrain=E2=80=9D is very pleasing.  Amongs=
t its disadvantages is the necessity for=20

the observer to gaze upwards as with refractors, which, when the object is =
at a considerable=20

altitude, is distressing, this is one of the reasons why the =E2=80=9CNewto=
nian=E2=80=9D is so pleasant to use, on=20

account of the natural and easy position of the observer. The eye-piece bei=
ng a fixture, it is not=20

quite so convenient to use some of the accessories of the telescope. But th=
ere are means to=20

overcome these drawbacks, and so make the =E2=80=9CCassegrain=E2=80=9D even=
