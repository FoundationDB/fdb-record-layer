1878_.  DEAR SIR,=E2=80=94The 5-1/4 in. is beautiful. Last night there was =
a slight frosty fog, and the air=20

was very very steady, in fact I only remember about one such night since No=
vember, 1875. Saturn=20

was sharp and hard, and the shadow of the ring intensely black, with all po=
wers from 168 to 372,=20

and even with 550, obtained by removing the field lens of 372. The very bro=
ad polar caps=20

presented a bluish grey, rendered more visible by contrast with a fine penu=
mbral line of a very=20

slightly brownish grey close to the south border of the ring, and which see=
med to be diffused on=20

the south border (_i.e._, the line was diffused). I should fancy the line h=
ere referred to was less=20

than 1 of arc broad; considerably less!  Turning from Saturn, I looked at  =
Arietis, the present=20

distance of which is only 1=C2=B717; with all powers, from 213 upwards, the=
 components were visible as=20

two tiny points of light thoroughly divorced, and with 288 power, reminding=
 one of ^2 Lyr=C3=A6, as=20

seen with 120 on a 2-3/4 in. achr., only the discs seemed freer from rings.=
  Later in the evening,=20

when the definition was more fluttery,  Orionis shared the same fate as  Ar=
ietis, being well=20

separated with the same powers. The present distance of this star is only 1=
=C2=B712. Recently I divided=20

this star with a 4-1/2 in. stop on the mirror, power 288. I have seen  Arie=

too. I think I have told you before that the 5-1/4 in., with 372 power, was=
 successful in dividing=20

Equulei, whose distance is only 0=C2=B797. This is the closest star I have =
yet divided.  The Moon is fine=20

SIR,=E2=80=94I was very much interested in reading your account of the grin=

speculum, in this week=E2=80=99s E. M., copied from the =E2=80=9CMonthly No=

Every really good night gives me some fresh proof of the great excellence o=

 not, of course, have=20

recognized it had it not been that this month=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CObservator=

five inner sats. of Saturn, for 8 p.m. on every day of this month, and a ca=

was fully rewarded by a clear and steady view of it at that time in its pro=

Rev. T. W. WEBB warmly congratulated me, and said that he had seen Encel. w=

 views of Mr. WEBB=E2=80=99S new=20

opportunity of trying the (an 8-1/2) mirror on Jupiter, although this plane=
t was lower than it should=20

have been to give the fairest trial. Well, I can only assure you that, desp=

saw it so beautifully before. The contour of the clouds, particularly one o=

delicate lines, and the colouring of the belts, were all seen with a sharpn=
ess which I had believed=20

scarcely attainable, and proving that the result of your labours has been t=

or upon it, with the=20

 out clearly, well=20

separated from its bright primary, although the night was not good. I hardl=

that I am extremely grateful to you is a very poor expression of my feeling=
