dracaena marginata to fresh grass. I'm going on, I repeat, no matter what happens. I'm going on to the desperate end, like my own Dinkie with the chocolate-cake when I warned him he'd burst if he dared to eat another piece and he "he had been persuaded by that worthy gentleman (Hampden) to believe many things which he had since found to be untrue, and therefore he had changed his opinion in many particulars as well to things as persons." dracaena marginata to fresh grass.

Fountain of the Sunken Boat, and eat the numbered duck so reverentially doled out at La Tour 

d'Argent and puff their cigarettes behind the beds of begonias and marguerites at the Chateau 

Madrid. They too will get tired of it, and step aside for others. For the petal falls from the blossom 

and the blossom plumps out into fruit. And all those golden girls, when their day is over, must slip 

away from those gardens of laughter. When they don't, they only make themselves ridiculous. For 

there's nothing sadder than an antique lady of other days decking herself out in the furbelows of a 

lost youth. And I've got Dinky-Dunk's overalls to patch and my bread to set, so I can't think much 

more about it to-night. But after I've done my chores, and before I go up to bed, I'm going to read 

_Rabbi Ben Ezra_ right through to the end. I'll do it in front of the fire, with my feet up and with 

three Ontario Northern Spy apples on a plate beside me, to be munched as Audrey herself might 

have munched them, oblivious of any Touchstone and his reproving eyes.  I have stopped to 

ponder, however, how much of this morbid dread of mine for big cities is due to that short and 

altogether unsatisfactory visit to New York, to that sense of coming back a stranger and finding old 

friends gone and those who were left with such entirely new interests.  I was out of it, completely 

and dishearteningly out of it. And my clothes were all wrong. My hats were wrong; my shoes were 

wrong; and every rag I had on me was in some way wrong. I was a tourist from the provinces. And 

I wasn't up-to-date with either what was on me or was _in_ me. I didn't even know the new subway 

routes or the telephone rules or the proper places to go for tea. The Metropolitan looked cramped 

and shoddy and _Tristan_ seemed shoddily sung to me. There was no thrill to it. And even _The 

Jewels of the Madonna_ impressed me as a bit garish and off color, with the Apache Dance of the 

last act almost an affront to God and man. I even asked myself, when I found that I had lost the 

trick of laughing at bridal-suite farces, if it was the possession of children that had changed me. 

For when you're with children you must in some way match their snowy innocence with a kindred 

coloring of innocence, very much as the hare and the weasel and the ptarmigan turn white to 

match the whiteness of our northern winter. Yet I was able to wring pure joy out of Rachmaninoff's 

playing at Carnegie Hall, with a great man making music for music's sake. I loved the beauty and 

balance and splendid sanity of that playing, without keyboard fire-works and dazzle and glare. But 

Rachmaninoff was the exception. Even Central Park seemed smaller than of old, and I couldn't 

remember which drives Dinky-Dunk and I had taken in the historic old hansom-cab after our 

equally historic marriage by ricochet. Fifth Avenue itself was different, the caterpillar of trade 

having crawled a little farther up the stalk of fashion, for the shops, I found, went right up to the 

Park, and the old W. K. house where we once danced our long-forgotten Dresden China Quadrille, 

in imitation of the equally forgotten Eighty-Three event, confronted me as a beehive of business 

offices. I couldn't quite get used to the new names and the new faces and the new shops and the 

side-street theaters and the thought of really nice girls going to a prize-fight in Madison Square 

Garden, and the eternal and never-ending talk about drinks, about where and how to get them, 

and how to mix them, and how much Angostura to put into 'em, and the musty ale that used to be 

had at Losekam's in Washington, and the _Beaux Arts_ cocktails that used to come with a dash of 

absinthe, and the shipment of pinch-neck Scotch which somebody smuggled in on his cruiser-

yacht from the east end of Cuba, and so-forth and so-forth until I began to feel that the only 

important thing in the world was the possession and dispensation of alcohol. And out of it I got the 

headache without getting the fun. I had the same dull sense of being cheated which came to me in 



my flapper days when I fell asleep with a mouthful of contraband gum and woke up in the morning 

with my jaw-muscles tired--I'd been facing all the exertion without getting any of the satisfaction. 

The one bright spot to me, in that lost city of my childhood, was the part of Madison Avenue which 

used to be known as Murray Hill, the right-of-way along the west sidewalk of which I once 

commandeered for an afternoon's coasting. I could see again, as I glanced down the familiar 

slope, the puffy figure of old Major Elmes, who in those days was always pawing somebody, since 

he seemed to believe with Novalis that he touched heaven when he placed his hand on a human 

body. I could see myself sky-hooting down that icy slope on my coaster, approaching the old Major 

from the rear and peremptorily piping out: "One side, please!" For I was young then, and I 

expected all life to make way for me. But the old Major betrayed no intention of altering his 

solemnly determined course at any such juvenile suggestion, with the result that he sat down on 

me bodily, and for the next two blocks approached his club in Madison Square in a manner and at 

a speed which he had in no wise anticipated. But, _Eheu_, how long ago it all seemed! 

_Saturday the Tenth_   Peter has written back in answer to my question as to the expediency of 

sending my boy off to a boarding-school. He put all he had to say in two lines. They were:  "_I had 

a mother like Dinkie's, I'd stick to her until the stars were dust._"  That was very nice of Peter, of 

course, but I don't imagine he had any idea of the peck of trouble he was going to stir up at Casa 

Grande. For Dinky-Dunk picked up the sheet of paper on which that light-hearted message had 

been written and perused the two lines, perused them with a savagery which rather disturbed me. 

He read them for the second time, and then he put them down. His eye, as he confronted me, was 

a glacial one.  "It's too bad we can't run this show without the interference of outsiders," he 

announced as he stalked out of the room.  I've been thinking the thing over, and trying to get my 

husband's view-point. But I can't quite succeed. There has always been a touch of the satyric in 

Dinky-Dunk's attitude toward Peter's weekly letter to my boy. He has even intimated that they were 

written in a new kind of Morse, the inference being that they were intended to carry messages in 

cipher to eyes other than Dinkie's. But Peter is much too honest a man for any such resort to 

subterfuge. And Dinky-Dunk has always viewed with a hostile eye the magazines and books and 

toys which big-hearted Peter has showered out on us. Peter always was ridiculously open-handed. 

And he always loved my Dinkie. And it's only natural that our thoughts should turn back to where 

our love has been left. Peter, I know, gets quite as much fun out of those elaborately playful letters 

to Dinkie as Dinkie does himself. And it's left the boy more anxious to learn, to the end that he may 

pen a more respectable reply to them.  Some of Peter's gifts, it is true, have been embarrassingly 

ornate, but Peter, who has been given so much, must have remembered how little has come to my 

kiddies. It was my intention, for a while, to talk this over with Dinky-Dunk, to try to make him see it 

in a more reasonable light. But I have now given up that intention. There's a phantasmal 

something that holds me back....  I dreamt last night that my little Dinkie was a grown youth in a 

Greek academy, wearing a toga and sitting on a marble bench overlooking a sea of lovely 

sapphire. There both Peter and Percy, also arrayed in togas, held solemn discourse with my 

offspring and finally agreed that once they were through with him he would be the Wonder of the 

Age....  Dinky-Dunk asked me point-blank to-day if I'd consider the sale of Casa Grande, provided 

he got the right price for the ranch. I felt, for a moment, as though the bottom had been knocked 

out of my world. But it showed me the direction in which my husband's thoughts have been 



running of late. And I just as pointedly retorted that I'd never consent to the sale of Casa Grande. 

It's not merely because it's our one and only home. It's more because of the little knoll where the 

four Manitoba maples have been set and the row of taken in for meditation is the best employed in 

all their lives for if the uncertainty of our state and being is then brought before us who is there that 

will not immediately discover the inconsistency of all his behaviour and the vanity of all his 

pursuits? And yet, we are so mixed and compounded that, though I think seriously this minute, 

and lie down with good intentions, it is likely I may rise with my old nature, or perhaps with the 

addition of some new impertinence, and be the same wandering lump of idle errors that I have 

ever been.  "You certainly advise me well. You have pointed out the only way where there can be 

no disappointment, and comfort that will never fail us, carrying men steadily and cheerfully in their 

journey, and a place of rest at the end. Nobody can be more persuaded of it than I am; but 

situation, example, the current of things, and our natural weakness, draw me away with the herd, 

and only leave me just strength enough to resist the worst degree of our iniquities. There are times 

when men fret at trifles and quarrel with their toothpicks. In one of these ill-habits I exclaim against 

the present condition, and think it is the worst of all; but coolly and temperately it is plainly the 

best. Where there is most employment and least vice, there one should wish to be. There is a 

meanness and a baseness not to endure with patience the little inconveniences we are subject to; 

and to know no happiness but in one spot, and that in ease, in luxury, in idleness, seems to 

deserve our contempt. There are young men amongst us that have great revenues and high 

military stations, that repine at three months' service with their regiments if they go fifty miles from 

home. Soup and _venaison_ and turtle are their supreme delight and joy,--an effeminate race of 

coxcombs, the future leaders of our armies, defenders and protectors of our great and free nation! 

"You bid me avoid Fort William, because you believe it still worse than this place. That will not be 

my reason for wishing to avoid it; but the change of conversation; the fear of becoming a mere 

ruffian; and of imbibing the tyrannical principles of an absolute commander, or, giving way 

insensibly to the temptations of power, till I become proud, insolent and intolerable;--these 

considerations will make me wish to leave the regiment before the next winter, and always if it 

could be so after eight months duty; that by frequenting men above myself I may know my true 

condition, and by discoursing with the other sex may learn some civility and mildness of carriage, 

but never pay the price of the last improvement with the loss of reason. Better be a savage of 

some use than a gentle, amorous puppy, obnoxious to all the world. One of the wildest of wild 

clans is a worthier being than a perfect Philander."  Wolfe, it must be owned, does not write well. 

He has reason to envy, as he does, the grace of the female style. He is not only ungrammatical, 

which, in a familiar letter, is a matter of very small consequence, but somewhat stilted. Perhaps it 

was like the "Madam," the fashion of the Johnsonian era. Yet beneath the buckram you always 

feel that there is a heart. Persons even of the same profession are cast in very different moulds; 

and the mould of Wolfe was as different as possible from that of the Iron Duke.  Wolfe's dreary 

garrison leisures in Scotland, however, were not idle. His books go with him, and he is doing his 

best to cultivate himself, both professionally and generally. He afterwards recommends to a friend, 

evidently from his own experience, a long list of military histories and other works ancient and 

modern. The ancients he read in translations. His range is wide and he appreciates military genius 

in all its forms. "There is an abundance of military knowledge to be picked out of the lives of 



Gustavus Adolphus and Charles XII., King of Sweden, and of Zisca the Bohemian, and if a 

tolerable account could be got of the exploits of Scanderbeg, it would be inestimable, for he excels 

all the officers ancient and modern in the conduct of a small defensive army." At Louisburg, Wolfe 

put in practice, with good effect, a manoeuvre which he had learned from the Carduchi in 

Xenophon, showing perhaps by this reproduction of the tactics employed two thousand years 

before by a barbarous tribe, that in the so-called art of war there is a large element which is not 

progressive. Books will never make a soldier, but Wolfe, as a military student, had the advantage 

of actual experience of war. Whenever he could find a teacher, he studied mathematics, zealously 

though apparently not with delight. "I have read the mathematics till I am grown perfectly stupid, 

and have algebraically worked away the little portion of understanding that was allowed to me. 

They have not even left me the qualities of a coxcomb for I can neither laugh nor sing nor talk an 

hour upon nothing. The latter of these is a sensible loss, for it excludes a gentleman from all good 

company and makes him entirely unfit for the conversation of the polite world." "I don't know how 

the mathematics may assist the judgment, but they have a great tendency to make men dull. I who 

am far from being sprightly even in my gaiety, am the very reverse of it at this time." Certainly to 

produce sprightliness is neither the aim nor the general effect of mathematics. That while military 

education was carried on, general culture was not wholly neglected, is proved by the famous 

exclamation about Gray's Elegy, the most signal homage perhaps that a poet ever received. At 

Glasgow, where there is a University, Wolfe studies mathematics in the morning, in the afternoon 

he endeavours to regain his lost Latin.  Nor in training himself did he neglect to train his soldiers. 

He had marked with bitterness of heart the murderous consequence to which neglect of training 

had led in the beginning of every war. Probably he had the army of Frederick before his eyes. His 

words on musketry practice may still have an interest. "Marksmen are nowhere so necessary as in 

a mountainous country; besides, firing at objects teaches the soldiers to level incomparably, 

makes the recruit steady, and removes the foolish apprehension that seizes young soldiers when 

they first load their arms with bullets. We fire, first singly, then by files, one, two, three, or more, 

then by ranks, and lastly by platoons; and the soldiers see the effects of their shots, especially at a 

mark or upon water. We shoot obliquely and in different situations of ground, from heights 

downwards and contrariwise."  Military education and attention to the details of the profession 

were not very common under the Duke of Wellington. They were still less common under the Duke 

of Cumberland. Before he was thirty, Wolfe was a great military authority, and what was required 

of Chatham, in his case, was not so much the eye to discern latent merit, as the boldness to 

promote merit over the head of rank.  In a passage just quoted Wolfe expresses his fear lest 

command should make him tyrannical. He was early tried by the temptation of power. He became 

Lieut.-Colonel at twenty-five; but in the absence of his Colonel he had already been in command 

at Stirling when he was only twenty- three. This was in quarters where he was practically despotic. 

He does not fail in his letters to pour out his heart on his situation. "Tomorrow Lord George 

Sackville goes away, and I take upon me the difficult and troublesome employment of a 

commander. You can't conceive how difficult a thing it is to keep the passions within bounds, when 

authority and immaturity go together: to endeavour at a character which has every opposition from 

within, and that the very condition of the blood is a sufficient obstacle to. Fancy you see me that 

must do justice to good and bad; reward and punish with an equal unbiassed hand; one that is to 



reconcile the severity of discipline with the dictates of humanity, one that must study the tempers 

and dispositions of many men, in order to make their situation easy and agreeable to them, and 

should endeavour to oblige all without partiality; a mark set up for everybody to observe and judge 

of; and last of all, suppose one employed in discouraging vice, and recommending the reverse, at 

the turbulent age of twenty-three, when it is possible I may have 


_
been planted along the little iron fence, the little iron fence which twice a year I paint a virginal 

white, with my own hands. For that's where my Pee-Wee sleeps, and that lonely little grave must 

never pass out of my care, to be forgotten and neglected and tarnished with time. It's not a place 

of sorrow now, but more an altar, duly tended, the flower-covered bed of my Pee-Wee, of my poor 

little Pee-Wee who was so brimming with life and love. He used to make me think of a humming-

bird in a garden--and now all I have left of him is my small chest of toys and trinkets and baby-

clothes. God, I know, will be good to that lonely little newcomer in His world of the statelier dead, 

in His gallery of whispering ghosts. Oh, be good to him, God! Be good to him, or You shall be no 

God of mine! I can't think of him as dead, as going out like a candle, as melting into nothingness 

as the little bones under their six feet of earth molder away. But my laddie is gone. And I must not 

be morbid. As Peter once said, misery loves company, but the company is apt to seek more 

convivial quarters. Yet something has gone out of my life, and that something drives me back to 

my Dinkie and my Poppsy with a sort of fierceness in my hunger to love them, to make the most of 

them.  Gershom, who has been giving Poppsy a daily lesson at home, has just inquired why she 

shouldn't be sent to school along with Dinkie. And her father has agreed. It gave me the wretched 

feeling, for a moment or two, that they were conspiring to take my last baby away from me. But I 

have to bow to the fact that I no longer possess one, since Poppsy announced her preference, the 

other day, for a doll "with real livings in it." She begins to show as fixed an aversion to baby-talk as 

that entertained by old Doctor Johnson himself, and no longer yearns to "do yidin on the team-

tars," as she used to express it. The word "birthday" is still "birfday" with her, and "water" is still 

"wagger," but she now religiously eschews all such reiterative diminutives as "roundy-poundy" and 

"Poppsy-Woppsy" and "beddy-bed." She has even learned, after much effort, to convert her earlier 

"keam of feet" into the more legitimate and mature "cream of wheat." And now that she has a 

better mastery of the sibilants the charm has rather gone out of the claim, which I so laboriously 

taught her, that "Daddy is all feet," meaning, of course, that he was altogether sweet--which he 

gave small sign of being when he first caught the point of my patient schooling. She is not so 

quick-tongued as her brother Dinkie, but she has a natural fastidiousness which makes her long 

for alignment with the proprieties. She is, in fact, a conformist, a sedate and dignified little lady 

who will never be greatly given to the spilling of beans and the upsetting of apple-carts. She is, in 

many ways, amazingly like her pater. She will, I know, be a nice girl when she grows up, without 

very much of that irresponsibility which seems to have been the bugbear of her maternal parent. 

I'm even beginning to believe there's something in the old tradition about ancestral traits so often 

skipping a generation. At any rate, that crazy-hearted old Irish grandmother of mine passed on to 

me a muckle o' her wildness, the mad County Clare girl who swore at the vicar and rode to hounds 

and could take a seven-barred gate without turning a hair and was apt to be always in love or in 

debt or in hot water. She died too young to be tamed, I'm told, for say what you will, life tames us 

all in the end. Even Lady Hamilton took to wearing red-flannel petticoats before she died, and 

Buffalo Bill faded down into plain Mr. William Cody, and the way as any of the men that I converse 

with." He had difficulties of character to contend with, as well as difficulties of age. His temper was 

quick; he knew it. "My temper is much too warm, and sudden resentment forces out expressions 

and even actions that are neither justifiable nor excusable, and perhaps I do not conceal the 

natural heat so much as I ought to do." He even felt that he was apt to misconstrue the intentions 



of those around him, and to cherish groundless prejudices. "I have that wicked disposition of mind 

that whenever I know that people have entertained a very ill opinion, I imagine they never change. 

From whence one passes easily to an indifference about them, and then to dislike, and though I 

flatter myself that I have the seeds of justice strong enough to keep from doing wrong, even to an 

enemy, yet there lurks a hidden poison in the heart that it is difficult to root out. It is my misfortune 

to catch fire on a sudden, to answer letters the moment I receive them, when they touch me 

sensibly, and to suffer passion to dictate my expressions more than my reason. The next day, 

perhaps, would have changed this, and earned more moderation with it. Every ill turn of my life 

has had this haste and first impulse of the moment for its cause, and it proceeds from pride." 

Solitary command and absence from the tempering influences of general society were, as he 

keenly felt, likely to aggravate his infirmities. Yet he proves not only a successful but a popular 

commander, and he seems never to have lost his friends. The "seeds of justice" no doubt were 

really strong, and the transparent frankness of his character, its freedom from anything like 

insidiousness or malignity, must have had a powerful effect in dispelling resentment.  His first 

regimental minute, of which his biographer gives us an abstract, evinces a care for his men which 

must have been almost startling in the days of "Hangman Hawley." He desires to be acquainted in 

writing with the men and the companies they belong to, and as soon as possible with their 

characters, that he may know the proper objects to encourage, and those over whom it will be 

necessary to keep a strict hand. The officers are enjoined to visit the soldiers' quarters frequently; 

now and then to go round between nine and eleven o'clock at night, and not trust to sergeants' 

reports. They are also requested to watch the looks of the privates, and observe whether any of 

them were paler than usual, that the reason might be inquired into and proper means used to 

restore them to their former vigour. Subalterns are told that "a young officer should not think he 

does too much." But firmness, and great firmness, must have been required, as well as 

watchfulness and kindness. His confidential expressions with regard to the state of the army are 

as strong as words can make them. "I have a very mean opinion of the Infantry in general. I know 

their discipline to be bad and their valour precarious. They are easily put into disorder and hard to 

recover out of it. They frequently kill their officers in their fear and murder one another in their 

confusion." "Nothing, I think, can hurt their discipline--it is at its worst. They shall drink and swear, 

plunder and murder, with any troops in Europe, the Cossacks and Calmucks themselves not 

excepted." "If I stay much longer with the regiment I shall be perfectly corrupt; the officers are 

loose and profligate and the soldiers are very devils." He brought the 67th, however, into such a 

condition that it remained a model regiment for years after he was gone.  Nor were the duties of a 

commanding officer in Scotland at that period merely military. 


_
a day up to her needlework, we are told, and doubtlessly had trouble with both her teeth and her 

waist measurement.  Dinky-Dunk is proud of his Poppsy and has announced that it's about time 

we tucked the "Poppsy" away with her baby-clothes and resorted to the use of the proper and 

official "Pauline Augusta." So Pauline we shall try to have it, after this. There are several things, I 

think, which draw Dinky-Dunk and his Poppsy--I mean his Pauline--together. One is her likeness 

to himself. Another is her tractability, though I hate to hitch so big a word on to so small a lady. 

And still another is the fact that she is a girl. There's a subliminal play of sex-attraction about it, I 

suppose, just as there probably is between Dinkie and me. And there's something very admirable 

in Pauline Augusta's staid adoration of her dad. She plays up to him, I can see, without quite 

knowing she's doing it. She's hungry for his approval, and happiest, always, in his presence. Then, 

too, she makes him forget, for the time at least, his disappointment in a soul-mate who hasn't quite 

measured up to expectations! And I devoutly thank the Master of Life and Love that my solemn old 

Dinky-Dunk can thus care for his one and only daughter. It softens him, and keeps the sordid 

worries of the moment from vitrifying his heart. It puts a rainbow in his sky of every-day work, and 

gives him something to plan and plot and live for. And he needs it. We all do. It's our human and 

natural hunger for companionship. And as he observed not long ago, if that hunger can't be 

satisfied at home, we wander off and snatch what we can on the wing. Some day when they're 

rich, I overheard Dinky-Dunk announcing the other night, Pauline Augusta and her Dad are going 

to make the Grand Tour of Europe. And there, undoubtedly, do their best to pick up a Prince of the 

Royal Blood and have a chateau in Lombardy and a villa on the Riviera and a standing invitation 

to all the Embassy Balls!  Well, not if I know it. None of that penny-a-liner moonshine for my 

daughter. And as she grows older, I feel sure, I'll have more influence over her. She'll begin to 

realize that the battle of life hasn't scarred up for nothing this wary-eyed old mater who's beginning 

to know a hawk from a henshaw. I've learned a thing or two in my day, and one or two of them are 

going to be passed on to my offspring.     _Thursday the Fifteenth_   Struthers and I have been 

house-cleaning, for this is the middle of May, and our reluctant old northern spring seems to be 

here for good. It has been backward, this year, but the last of the mud has gone, and I hope to 

have my first setting of chicks out in a couple of days. Dinkie wants to start riding Buntie to school, 

but his pater says otherwise. Gershom goes off every morning, with Calamity Kate hitched to the 

old buckboard, with my two kiddies packed in next to him and provender enough for himself and 

the kiddies and Calamity Kate under the seat. The house seems very empty when they are away. 

But some time about five, every afternoon, I see them loping back along the trail. Then comes the 

welcoming bark of old Bobs, and a raid on the cooky-jar, and traces of bread-and-jelly on two 

hungry little faces, and the familiar old tumult about the reanimated rooms of Casa Grande. Then 

Poppsy--I beg her ladyship's pardon, for I mean, of course, Pauline Augusta--has to duly inspect 

her dolls to assure herself that they are both well-behaved and spotless as to apparel, for Pauline 

Augusta is a stickler as to decorum and cleanliness; and Dinkie falls to working on his air-ship, 

which he is this time making quite independent of Whinnie, whose last creation along that line 

betrayed a disheartening disability for flight. But even this second effort, I'm afraid, is doomed to 

failure, for more than once I've seen Dinkie back away and stand regarding his incompetent flier 

with a look of frustration on his face. He is always working over machinery--for he loves anything 

with wheels--and I'm pretty well persuaded that the twentieth-century mania of us grown-ups for 



picking ourselves to pieces is nothing more than a development of this childish hunger to get the 

cover off things and see the works go round. Dinkie makes wagons and carts and water-wheels, 

but some common fatality of incompetence overtakes them all and they are cast aside for 

enterprises more novel and more promising. He announces, now, that he intends to be an 

engineer. And that recalls the time when I was convinced in my own soul that he was destined for 

a life of art, since he was forever asking me to draw him "a li'l' man," and later on fell to drawing 

them himself. He would do his best to inscribe a circle and then emboss it with perfectly upright 

hair, as though the person in question had just been perusing the most stirring of penny-dreadfuls. 

Then he would put in two dots of eyes, and one abbreviated and vertical line for the nose, and 

another elongated and horizontal line for the mouth, and arms with extended and extremely 

elocutionary fingers, to say nothing of extremely attenuated legs which invariably toed-out, to 

make more discernible the silhouette of the ponderously booted feet. I have several dozen of 

these "li'l' men" carefully treasured in an old cigar-box. But he soon lost interest in these purely 

anthropocentric creations and broadened out into the delineation of boats and cars and wheel-

barrows and rocking-chairs and tea-pots, lying along the floor on his stomach for an hour at a time, 

his tongue moving sympathetically with every movement of his pencil. He held the latter clutched 

close to the point by his stubby little fingers.  I had to call a halt on all such artistry, however, for he 

startled me, one day, by suddenly going crosseyed. It came, of course, from working with his nose 

too close to the paper. I imagined, with a sinking heart, that it was an affliction which was to stay 

with him for the rest of his natural life. But a night's sleep did much to restore the over-taxed eye-

muscles and before the end of a week they had entirely righted themselves.  To-morrow Dinkie will 

probably want to be an aeronaut, and the next day a cowboy, and the next an Indian scout, for I 

notice that his enthusiasms promptly conform to the stimuli with which he chances to be 

confronted. Last Sunday he asked me to read Macaulay's _Horatius_ to him. I could see, after 

doing so, that it was going to his head exactly as a second Clover-Club cocktail goes to the head 

of a sub-deb. On Tuesday, when I went out about sun-down to get him to help me gather the 

eggs, I found that he had made a sword by nailing a bit of stick across a slat from the hen-house, 

and also observed that he had possessed himself of my boiler-top. So I held back, slightly 

puzzled. But later on, hearing much shouting and clouting and banging of tin, I quietly investigated 

and found Dinkie in the corral-gate, holding it against all comers. So earnest was he about it, so 

rapt was he in that solemn business of warfare, that I decided to slip away without letting him see 

me. He was sixteen long centuries away from Casa Grande, at that moment. He was afar off on 

the banks of the Tiber, defending the Imperial City against Lars Porsena and his footmen. All 

Rome was at his back, cheering him on, and every time his hen-coop slat thumped that shredded 

old poplar gate-post some proud son of Tuscany bit the dust.     _Sunday the Twenty-Fifth_ 

Duncan, it's plain to see, is still in the doldrums. He is uncommunicative and moody and goes 

about his work with a listlessness which is more and more disturbing to me. He surprised his wife 

the other day by addressing her as "Lady Selkirk," for the simple reason, he later explained, that I 

propose to be monarch of all I survey, with none to dispute my domain. And a little later he further 

intimated that I was like a miser with a pot of gold, satisfied to live anywhere so long as my 

precious family-life could go clinking through my fingers.  That was last Sunday--a perfect prairie 

day--when I sat out on the end of the wagon-box, watching Poppsy and Dinkie. I sat in the warm 



sunlight, in a sort of trance, staring at those two children as they went about their solemn business 

of play. They impressed me as quenching the smoking embers of rebellion, and in re-organizing 

the country after the anarchy of civil war. Disarming had to be done, and suppression of the 

Highland costume, which now marks the Queen's favourite regiment, but then marked a rebel. 

This is bad, as well as unworthy, work for soldiers, who have not the trained self-command which 

belongs to a good police, and for which the Irish Constabulary are as remarkable as they are for 

courage and vigour. Even Wolfe's sentiments contracted a tinge of cruelty from his occupation. In 

one of his subsequent letters he avows a design which would have led to the massacre of a whole 

clan. "Would you believe that I am so bloody?" We do not believe that he was so bloody, and are 

confident that the design, if it was ever really formed, would not have been carried into effect. But 

the passage is the most painful one in his letters. The net result of his military administration, 

however, was that the people at Inverness were willing to celebrate the Duke of Cumberland's 

birthday, though they were not willing to comply with the insolent demand of Colonel Lord Bury, 

who had come down to take the command for a short time, that they should celebrate it on the 

anniversary of Culloden. It is a highly probable tradition that the formation of Highland regiments 

was suggested by Wolfe.  In a passage which we have quoted Wolfe glances at the awkward and 

perilous position in which a young commander was placed in having to control the moral habits of 

officers his equals in age, and to rebuke the passions which mutinied in his own blood. He could 

hardly be expected to keep himself immaculate. But he is always struggling to do right and 

repentant when he does wrong. "We use a very dangerous freedom and looseness of speech 

among ourselves; this by degrees makes wickedness and debauchery less odious than it should 

be, if not familiar, and sets truth, religion, and virtue at a great distance. I hear things every day 

said that would shock your ears, and often say things myself that are not fit to be repeated, 

perhaps without any ill intention, but merely by the force of custom. The best that can be offered in 

our defence is that some of us see the evil and wish to avoid it." Among the very early letters there 

is one to his brother about "pretty mantua makers," etc, but it is evidently nothing but a nominal 

deference to the military immorality of the age. Once when on a short visit to London, and away 

from the restraining responsibilities of his command, Wolfe, according to his own account, lapsed 

into debauchery. "In that short time I committed more imprudent acts than in all my life before I 

lived in the idlest, [most] dissolute, abandoned manner that could be conceived, and that not out of 

vice, which is the most extraordinary part of it. I have escaped at length and am once more master 

of my reason, and hereafter it shall rule my conduct; at least I hope so." Perhaps the lapse may 

have been worse by contrast than in itself. The intensity of pure affection which pervades all 

Wolfe's letters is sufficient proof that he had never abandoned himself to sensuality to an extent 

sufficient to corrupt his heart. The age was profoundly sceptical, and if the scepticism had not 

spread to the army the scoffing had. Wolfe more than once talks lightly of going to church as a 

polite form; but he appears always to have a practical belief in God.  It is worthy of remark that a 

plunge into London dissipation follows very close upon the disappointment of an honourable 

passion. Wolfe had a certain turn of mind which favoured matrimony "prodigiously," and he had 

fallen very much in love with Miss Lawson, Maid of Honour to the Princess of Wales. But the old 

General and Mrs. Wolfe opposed the match --apparently on pecuniary grounds. "They have their 

eye upon one of L30,000." Miss Lawson had only L12,000. Parents had more authority then than 



they have now, Wolfe was exceedingly dutiful, and he allowed the old people, on whom, from the 

insufficiency of his pay, he was still partly dependent, to break off the affair. Such at least seems to 

have been the history of its termination. The way in which Wolfe records the catastrophe, it must 

be owned, is not very romantic. "This last disappointment in love has changed my natural 

disposition to such a degree that I believe it is now possible that I might prevail upon myself not to 

refuse twenty or thirty thousand pounds, if properly offered. Rage and despair do not commonly 

produce such reasonable effects; nor are they the instruments to make a man's fortune by but in 

particular cases." It was long, however, before he could think of Miss Lawson without a pang, and 

the sight of her portrait, he tells us, takes away his appetite for some days.  At seven and twenty 

Wolfe left Scotland, having already to seven years' experience of warfare added five years' 

experience of difficult command. He is now able to move about a little and open his mind, which 

has been long cramped by confinement in Highland quarters. He visits an old uncle in Ireland, 

and, as one of the victors of Culloden, views with special interest that field of the Boyne, where in 

the last generation Liberty and Progress had triumphed over the House of Stuart. "I had more 

satisfaction in looking at this spot than in all the variety that I have met with; and perhaps there is 

not another piece of ground in the world that I could take so much pleasure to observe." Then, 

though with difficulty, he obtained the leave of the pipe-clay Duke to go to Paris. There he saw the 

hollow grandeur of the decaying monarchy and the immoral glories of Pompadour. "I was 

yesterday at Versailles, a cold spectator of what we commonly call splendour and magnificence. A 

multitude of men and women were assembled to bow and pay their compliments in the most 

submissive manner to a creature of their own species." He went into the great world, to which he 

gains admission with an ease which shows that he has a good position, and tries to make up his 

leeway in the graces by learning to fence, dance, and ride. He wishes to extend his tour and see 

the European armies; but the Duke inexorably calls him back to pipe-clay. It is proposed to him 

that he should undertake the tutorship of the young Duke of Richmond on a military tour through 

the Low Countries. But he declines the offer. "I don't think myself quite equal to the task, and as 

for the pension that might follow, it is very certain that it would not become me to accept it. I can't 

take money from any one but the King, my master, or from some of his blood."  Back, therefore, to 

England and two years more of garrison duty there. Quartered in the high-perched keep of Dover 

where "the winds rattle pretty loud" and cut off from the world without, as he says, by the absence 

of newspapers or coffee houses, he employs the tedious hours in reading while his officers waste 

them in piquet. The ladies in the town below complain through Miss Brett to Mrs. Wolfe of the 

unsociality of the garrison. "Tell Nannie Brett's ladies," Wolfe replies, "that if they lived as loftily 

and as much in the clouds as we do, their appetites for dancing or anything else would not be so 

keen. If we dress, the wind disorders our curls; if we walk, we are in danger of our legs; if we ride, 

of our necks." Afterwards, however, he takes to dancing to please the ladies and apparently grows 

fond of it.  Among the High Tories of Devonshire he has to do a little more of the work of 

pacification in which he had been employed in the Highlands. "We are upon such terms with the 

people in general that I have been forced to put on all my address, and employ my best skill to 

conciliate matters. It begins to work a little favourably, but not certainly, because the perverseness 

of these folks, built upon their disaffection, makes the task very difficult. We had a little ball last 

night, to celebrate His Majesty's birthday--purely military; that is the men were all officers except 



one. The female branches of the Tory families came readily enough, but not one man would 

accept the invitation because it was the King's birthday. If it had not fallen in my way to see such 

an instance of folly I should not readily be brought to conceive it." 


_
husky and happy-bodied little beings and I remembered that whatever prairie-life had cost me, it 

had not cost me the health of my family. My two bairns had been free of those illnesses and 

infections which come to the city child, and I was glad enough to remember it. But I was 

unconscious of Dinky-Dunk's cynic eye on me as I sat there brooding over my chicks. When he 

spoke to me, in fact, I was thinking how odd it was that Josie Langdon, on the very day before her 

marriage, should have carried me down to the lower end of Fifth Avenue and led me into the 

schoolroom of the Church of the Ascension, and asked me to study Sorolla's _Triste Herencia_ 

which hangs there.  I can still see that wonderful canvas where the foreshore of Valencia, usually 

so vivacious with running figures and the brightest of sunlight on dancing sails, had been made the 

wine-dark sea of the pagan questioner with the weight of immemorial human woe to shadow it. 

Josie had been asking me about marriage and children, for even she was knowing her more 

solemn moments in the midst of all that feverishly organized merriment. But I was surprised, when 

she slipped a hand through my arm, to see a tear run down her nose. So I looked up again at 

Sorolla's picture of the naked little cripples snatching at their moment's joy along the water's edge, 

at his huddled group of maimed and cast-off orphans trying to be happy without quite knowing 

how. I can still see the stunted little bodies, naked in sunlight that seemed revealing without being 

invigorating, clustered about the guardian figure of the tall old priest in black, the somberly 

benignant old figure that towered above the little wrecks on crutches and faced, as majestic as 

Millet's _Sower_, as austere and unmoved as Fate itself, a dark sea overhung by a dark sky. 

Sorolla was great in that picture, to my way of thinking. He was great in the manner in which he 

attunes nature to a human mood, in which he gives you the sunlight muffled, in some way, like the 

sunlight during a partial eclipse, and keys turbulence down to quietude, like the soft pedal that falls 

on a noisy street when a hearse goes by.  Josie felt it, and I felt it, that wordless thinning down of 

radiance, that mysterious holding back of warmth, until it seemed to strike a chill into the bones. It 

was the darker wing of Destiny hovering over man's head, deepening at the same time that it 

shadows the receding sky-line, so that even the memory of it, a thousand miles away, could drain 

the jocund blitheness out of the open prairie and give an air of pathos and solitude to my own 

children playing about my feet. Sorolla, I remembered, had little ones of his own. He _knew_. Life 

had taught him, and in teaching, had enriched his art. For the artist, after all, is the man who cuts 

up the loaf of his own heart, and butters it with beauty, and at tuppence a slice hands it to the 

hungry children of the world.  So when Dinky-Dunk laughed at me, for going into a trance over my 

own children, I merely smiled condoningly back at him. I felt vaguely sorry for him. He wasn't 

getting out of them what I was getting. He was being cheated, in some way, out of the very harvest 

for which he had sowed and waited. And if he had come to me, in that mood of relapse, if he had 

come to me with the slightest trace of humility, with the slightest touch of entreaty, on his face, I'd 

have hugged his salt-and-peppery old head to my bosom and begged to start all over again with a 

clean slate....  Gershom and I get along much better than I had expected. There's nothing wrong 

with the boy except his ineradicable temptation to impart to you his gratuitous tidbits of 

information. I can't object, of course, to Gershom having a college education: what I object to is his 

trying to give me one. I don't mind his wisdom, but I do hate to see him tear the whole tree of 

knowledge up by the roots and floor one with it. He has just informed me that there are estimated 

to be 30,000,000,000,000 red blood corpuscles in this body of mine, and I made him blink by 



solemnly challenging him to prove it. Quite frequently and quite sternly, too, he essays to correct 

my English. He reproved me for saying: "Go to it, Gershom!" And he declared I was in error in 

saying "The goose hangs high," as that was merely a vulgar corruption for "The goose whangs 

high," the "whanging" being the call of the wild geese high in the air when the weather is settled 

and fair. We live and learn!  But I can't help liking this pedagogic old Gershom who takes himself 

and me and all the rest of the world so seriously. I like him because he shares in my love for 

Dinkie and stands beside Peter himself in the fondly foolish belief that Dinkie has somewhere the 

hidden germ of greatness in him. Not that my boy is one of those precocious little bounders who 

are so precious in the eyes of their parents and so odious to the eyes of the rest of the world. He is 

a large-boned boy, almost a rugged-looking boy, and it is only I, knowing him as I do, who can 

fathom the sensibilities housed in that husky young body. There is a misty broodiness in his eyes 

which leaves them indescribably lovely to me as I watch him in his moments of raptness. But that 

look doesn't last long, for Dinkie can be rough in play and at times rough in speech, and deep 

under the crust of character I imagine I see traces of his Scottish father in him. I watch with an 

eagle eye for any outcroppings of that Caledonian-granite strain in his make-up. I inspect him as 

Chinkie used to inspect his fruit-trees for San Jose scale, for if there is any promise of hardness or 

cruelty there I want it killed in the bud.  But I don't worry as I used to, on that score. He may be 

rough-built, but moods cluster thick about him, like butterflies on a shelf of broken rock. And he is 

both pliable and responsive. I can shake him, when in the humor, by the mere telling of a story. I 

can control his color, I can excite him and exalt him, and bring him to the verge of tears, if I care 

to, by the mere tone of my voice as I read him one of his favorite tales out of one of Peter's books. 

But I shrink, in a way, from toying with those feelings. It seems brutal, cruel, merciless. For he is, 

after all, a delicate instrument, to be treated with delicacy. The soul of him must be kept packed 

away, like a violin, in its case of reserve well-padded with discretion. Two things I see in him: 

tenseness and beauty. And these are things which are lost, with rough handling. He shrinks away 

from brutality. Always, when he came to the picture of Samson pulling down the pillars of the 

temple, in Whinstane Sandy's big old illustrated Bible, he used to cover with one small hand a 

certain child on the temple steps as though to protect to the last that innocent one from the falling 

columns and cornices.  But I'm worried, at times, about Dinky-Dunk's attitude toward the boy. 

There are ways in which he demands too much from the child. His father is often unnecessarily 

rough in his play with him, seeming to take a morose delight in goading him to the breaking point 

and then lamenting his lack of grit, edging him on to the point of exasperation and then heaping 

scorn on him for his weakness. More than once I've seen his father actually hurt him, although the 

child was too proud to admit it. Dinky-Dunk, I think, really wants his boy to be a bigger figure in the 

world than his dad. Milord's a middle-aged man now and knows his limitations. He has realized 

just how high the supremest high-water mark of his life will stand. And being human, he must 

nurse his human regrets over his failures in life. So now he wishes to see his thwarted powers 

come to fuller fruit in his offspring. I'm afraid he'd even run the risk of sacrificing the boy's 

happiness for the sake of knowing Dinkie's wagon was to be hitched to the star of success. For I 

know my husband well enough to realize that he has always hankered after worldly success, that 

his god, if he had any, has always been the god of Power. I, too, want to see my son a success. 

But I want him to be happy first. I want to see him get some of the things I've been cheated out of, 



that I've cheated myself out of. That's the only way now I can get even with life. I can't live my own 

days over again. But I can catch at the trick of living them over again in my Dinkie.     _Thursday 

the Twenty-Ninth_   We have arrived at an armistice, Dinky-Dunk and I. It was forced on us, for 

things couldn't have gone on in the old intolerable manner. Dinky-Dunk, I fancy, began to realize 

that he hadn't been quite fair, and started making oblique but transparent enough efforts at 

appeasement. When he sat down close beside me, and I moved away, he said in a spirit of 

exaggerated self-accusation: "I'm afraid I've got a peach-stain on my reputation!" I retorted, at that, 

that she had never impressed me as much of a peach. Whereupon he merely laughed, as though 

it were a joke out of a Midnight Revue. Then he clipped a luridly illustrated advertisement of a 

nerve-medicine out of his newspaper and pinned it on my bedroom door, after I had ignored his 

tentative knock thereon the night before. The picture showed an anemic and woebegone couple 

haggling and shaking their fists at each other, while a large caption announced that "Thousands of 

Married Folks Lead a Cat and Dog Life--Are Cross, Crabbed and Grumpy!"--all of which could be 

obviated if they used Oxygated Iron.  What made it funny, of course, was the ridiculousness of the 

drawing. Then Dinky-Dunk, right before the blushing Gershom, accused me of being a love-piker. I 

could sniff which way the wind was blowing, but I sat tight. Then, to cap the climax, my husband 

announced that he had something for me which was surely going to melt my mean old prairie 

heart. And late that afternoon he came trundling up to Casa Grande with nothing more nor less 

than an old prairie-schooner.  It startled me, when I first caught sight of it. But its acquisition was 

not so miraculous as it might have seemed. Dinky-Dunk, has once more to sully a soldier's sword 

by undertaking police duty against the poor Gloucestershire weavers, who are on strike, and, as 

he judges, not without good cause. "This expedition carries me a little out of my road and a little in 

the dirt.... I hope it will turn out a good recruiting party, for the people are so oppressed, so poor 

and so wretched, that they will perhaps hazard a knock on the pate for bread and clothes and turn 

soldiers through sheer necessity."  Chatham and glory are now at hand; and the hero is ready for 

the hour-- _Sed mors atra caput nigra, circumvolat umbra_. "Folks are surprised to see the 

meagre, decaying, consumptive figure of the son, when the father and mother preserve such good 

looks; and people are not easily persuaded that I am one of the family. The campaigns of 1743, '4, 

'5, '6, and '7 stripped me of my bloom, and the winters in Scotland and at Dover have brought me 

almost to old age and infirmity, and this without any remarkable intemperance. A few years more 

or less are of very little consequence to the common run of men, and therefore I need not lament 

that I am perhaps somewhat nearer my end than others of my time. I think and write upon these 

points without being at all moved. It is not the vapours, but a desire I have to be familiar with those 

ideas which frighten and terrify the half of mankind that makes me speak upon the subject of my 

dissolution."  The biographer aptly compares Wolfe to Nelson. Both were frail in body, aspiring in 

soul, sensitive, liable to fits of despondency, sustained against all weaknesses by an ardent zeal 

for the public service, and gifted with the same quick eye and the same intuitive powers of 

command. But it is also a just remark that there was more in Nelson of the love of glory, more in 

Wolfe of the love of duty. "It is no time to think of what is convenient or agreeable; that service is 

certainly the best in which we are the most useful. For my part I am determined never to give 

myself a moment's concern about the nature of the duty which His Majesty is pleased to order us 

upon; and whether it is by sea or by land that we are to act in obedience to his commands, I hope 



that we shall conduct ourselves so as to deserve his approbation. It will be sufficient comfort to 

you, too, as far as my person is concerned, at least it will be a reasonable consolation, to reflect 

that the Power which has hitherto preserved me may, if it be his pleasure, continue to do so; if not, 

that it is but a few days or a few years more or less, and that those who perish in their duty and in 

the service of their country die honourably. I hope I shall have resolution and firmness enough to 

meet every appearance of danger without great concern, and not be over solicitous about the 

event." "I have this day signified to Mr. Pitt that he may dispose of my slight carcass as he 

pleases, and that I am ready for any undertaking within the reach and compass of my skill and 

cunning. I am in a very bad condition both with the gravel and rheumatism; but I had much rather 

die than decline any kind of service that offers itself: if I followed my own taste it would lead me 

into Germany, and if my poor talent was consulted they should place me in the cavalry, because 

nature has given me good eyes and a warmth of temper to follow the first impressions. However, it 

is not our part to choose but to obey."  All know that the way in which Mr. Pitt pleased to dispose 

of the "slight carcass" was by sending it to Rochefort, Louisburg, Quebec. Montcalm, when he 

found himself dying, shut himself up with his Confessor and the Bishop of Quebec, and to those 

who came to him for orders said "I have business that must be attended to of greater moment than 

your ruined garrison and this wretched country." Wolfe's last words were, "Tell Colonel Baxter to 

march Webb's regiment down to Charles River, to cut off their retreat from the Bridge. Now, God 

be praised, I will die in peace."     FALKLAND AND THE PURITANS  [Footnote: Published in the 

_Contemporary Review_ as a reply to Mr. Matthew Arnold's Essay on Falkland.]   We have the 

most unfeigned respect for the memory of Falkland. Carlyle's sneer at him has always seemed to 

us about the most painful thing in the writings of Carlyle. Our knowledge of his public life is 

meagre, and is derived mainly from a writer under whose personal influence he acted, who is 

specially responsible for the most questionable step that he took, and on whose veracity, with 

regard to this portion of the history not much reliance can be placed. But we cannot doubt his title 

to our admiration and our love. Of his character as a friend, as a host, and as the centre of a 

literary circle, we have a picture almost peerless in social history. He seems to have presented in 

a very attractive form the combination--rare now, though not rare in that age, especially among the 

great Puritan chiefs--of practical activity and military valour with high culture and a serious interest 

in great questions. Of his fine feelings as a man of honour we have more than one proof. We have 

proof equally strong of his self-sacrificing devotion to his country; though in this he stood not 

alone: with his blood on the field of Newbury mingled that of many an English yeoman, whose 

cheeks were as wet when he left his Puritan home to die for the religion and liberties of England 

as were those of Lord Falkland when he left the "lime-trees and violets" of Great Tew.  Of political 

moderation, if it means merely steering a middle course between two extremes, the praise is 

cheap, and would be shared by Falkland with many weak and with many dishonest men. It may, 

without disparagement, be remarked of him that his rank as a nobleman was almost sufficient in 

itself, without any special soundness of understanding or calmness of temperament, to prevent 

him from throwing himself headlong either into an absolutist reaction which was identified with the 

ascendency of upstart favourites, and contemners of the old nobility, or into a popular revolution 

which soon disclosed its tendency to come into collision with the privileged order, and which 

ended its parricidal career by leaving England, during some of the most glorious years of her 



history, destitute of a House of Lords. But as an adherent, and no doubt a deliberate adherent, of 

Constitutional Monarchy, Falkland was in that which in the upshot proved to be the right line of 

English progress, though by no means the right line of progress for the whole world. The 

Commonwealth is the ideal of America, where it is practicable, and it alone. Constitutional 

Monarchy, as Falkland rightly judged, was the highest attainable ideal for England, at any rate in 

that day. Of attaining that ideal, of doing anything considerable towards its attainment, or towards 

its defence against the powers of absolutist reaction whose triumph would have rendered its 

attainment for ever impossible, he was no more capable than he was of performing the labours of 

Hercules.  In this he bears some resemblance to a man of incomparably greater intellect than his. 

The fame of Bacon as a philosopher has eclipsed his importance as a politician. But his ideal of an 

enlightened monarchy, invested with plenary power, but always using its power in conformity with 

law, and having a Verulam at its right hand, not only is grand and worthy of the majestic 

intelligence from which it sprang, but is entitled to a good deal of sympathy, when we consider 

how wanting in enlightenment, how rough, how uncertain, how provoking to a trained and 

instructed statesman the action of parliaments composed of country gentlemen and meeting at 

long intervals, in an age when there were no political newspapers or other general organs of 

political information, could not fail sometimes to be. But Bacon, hampered by enfeebling 

selfishness, as Falkland was by more generous defects, was incapable of taking a single step 

toward the realization of his august vision, and the result was, a miserable fall from the ethereal 

height to the feet of a Somerset and a Buckingham.  As a theologian, Falkland appears to have 

been a Chillingworth on a very small scale. It does not seem to us that Principal Tulloch, in his 

interesting chapter on him, succeeds in putting him higher. But he shared, with Chillingworth and 

Hales, the spirit of liberality and toleration, for which both were nobly conspicuous, though Hales 

did not show himself a very uncompromising champion of his principles when he accepted 

preferment from the hands of their arch-enemy, Laud. The learned men and religious philosophers 

whom Falkland gathered round him at Tew, were among the best and foremost thinkers of their 

age: the beauty of the group is marred, perhaps, only by the sinister intrusion of Sheldon.  Mr. 

Matthew Arnold, in the very graceful sketch of Falkland's life published by him in aid of the 

Falkland Memorial, has endowed his favourite character with gifts far rarer and more memorable 

than those of which we have spoken; with an extraordinary largeness and lucidity of mind, with 

almost divine superiority to party narrowness and bias, with conceptions anticipative of the most 

advanced philosophy of modern times. He quotes the Dean of Westminster as affirming that 

"Falkland is the founder, or nearly the founder, of the best and most enlightening tendencies of the 

Church of England"--a statement which breeds reflection as to the character of the Church of 

England during the previous century, in the course of which its creed and liturgy were formed. The 

evidence of these transactions lies wide; much of it is still in the British Museum; and it may be 

possible to produce something sufficient to sustain Falkland on the pinnacle on which Mr. Arnold 

and the Dean of Westminster have placed him. But we cannot help surmising that he has in some 

measure undergone the process which, in an age prolific in historic fancies as well as pre-eminent 

in historic research, has been undergone by almost every character in history--that of 


_
born dickerer, has been trading some of his ranch-stock for town-lots on the outskirts of Buckhorn. 

On the back of one of these lots stood a tumble-down wooden building, and hidden away in this 

building was the prairie-schooner. Something about it had caught his fancy, so he had insisted that 

it be included in the deal. And home he brought it, with Tithonus and Tumble-Weed yoked to its 

antique tongue and his own Stetsoned figure high on the driving seat. They had told Dinky-Dunk it 

wasn't a really-truly authentic prairie-schooner, since practically all of the trekking north of the 

Fiftieth Parallel has been done by means of the Red River cart. But Dinky-Dunk, after looking 

more carefully over the heavy-timbered running-gear and the cumbersome iron-work, and 

discovering even the sturdy hooks under its belly from which the pails and pots of earlier travelers 

must have hung, concluded that it was one of the genuine old-timers, one of the "Murphies" once 

driven by a "bull-whacker" and drawn by "wheelers" and "pointers." Where it originally came from, 

Heaven only knows. But it had been used, five years before, for a centenary procession in the 

provincial capital and had emerged into the open again last summer for a town-booming _Rodeo_ 

twenty miles down the steel from Buckhorn. It looked like the dinosaur skeleton in the Museum of 

Natural History, with every vestige of its tarpaulin top gone. But Whinnie has already sewed 

together a canvas covering for its weather-beaten old roof-ribs, and has put clean wheat-straw in 

its box-bottom, so that it makes a kingly place for my two kiddies to play. I even spotted Dinkie, 

enthroned high on the big driving-seat, with a broken binder-whip in his hand, imagining he was 

one of the original Forty-Niners pioneering along the unknown frontiers of an unknown land. I 

could see him duck at imaginary arrows and frenziedly defend his family from imaginary Sioux with 

an imaginary musket. And I stood beside it this morning, dreaming of the adventures it must have 

lumbered through, of the freight it must have carried and the hopes it must have ferried as it once 

crawled westward along the floor of the world, from water-hole to lonely water-hole. I've been 

wondering if certain perforations in its side-boards can be bullet-holes and if certain dents and 

abrasions in its timbers mean the hostile arrows of skulking Apaches when women and children 

crouched low behind the ramparts of this tiny wooden fortress. I can't help picturing what those 

women and children had to endure, and how trivial, after all, are our puny hardships compared 

with theirs.  And I don't intend to dwell on those hardships. I'm holding out the hand of compromise 

to my fellow-trekker. Existence is only a prairie-schooner, and we have to accommodate ourselves 

to it. And I thank Heaven now that I can see things more ventriloquial apparatus through which the 

biographer preaches to the present from the pulpit of the past. The philosophy ascribed to 

Falkland is, we suspect, partly that of a teacher who was then in the womb of time. We should not 

be extreme to mark this, if the praise of Falkland had not been turned to the dispraise and even to 

the vilification of men who are at least as much entitled to reverent treatment at the hands of 

Englishmen as he is, and at the same time of a large body of English citizens at the present day, 

who are the objects, we venture to think, of a somewhat fanciful and somewhat unmeasured 

antipathy. Those who subscribe to the Falkland Testimonial are collectively set down by Mr. 

Arnold as the "amiable"--those who do not subscribe as the "unamiable." Few, we trust, would be 

so careful of their money and so careless of their reputation for moral beauty as to refuse to pay a 

guinea for a certificate of amiability countersigned by Mr. Matthew Arnold. Yet even the amiable 

might hesitate to take part in erecting a monument to the honour of Falkland, if it was at the same 

time to be a monument to the dishonour, of Luther, Gustavus, Walsingham, Sir John Eliot, Pym, 



Hampden, Cromwell, Vane, and Milton. As to the Nonconformists, their contributions are probably 

not desired: otherwise, accustomed to not very courteous treatment though they are, it would still 

be imprudent to warn them that their own "hideousness" was to be carved in the same marble with 

the beauty of Lord Falkland.  On Luther, Hampden, and Cromwell, Mr. Arnold expressly bestows 

the name of "Philistine," and if he bestows it on these he can hardly abstain from bestowing it on 

the rest of those we have named. Milton, at all events, has identified himself with Cromwell as 

thoroughly as one man ever identified himself with another, and whatever aspersion is cast on 

"Worcester's laureate wreath" must fall equally on the intermingling bays. We may say this without 

pretending to know what the exact meaning of "Philistine" now is. Originally, no doubt, it pointed to 

some specific defect on the part of those with regard to whom it was used, and possibly also on 

the part of those who used it. But with the fate which usually attends the cant phrase of a clique, it 

seems to be degenerating, by lavish application, into something which irritates without conveying 

any definite instruction. As Luther did not live under the same conditions as Heinrich Heine, 

perfect ethical identity was hardly to be expected. "Simpleton" and "savage" have the advantage 

of being intelligible to all, and when introduced into discussion with grace, perhaps they may be 

urbane.  It is useless to attempt, without authentic materials, to fill in the faint outline of an historic 

figure. But judging from such indications as we have, we should be inclined to say that Falkland, 


_
more quietly. That's a lesson Time teaches us. And Father Time, after all, has to hand us 

something to make up for so mercilessly permitting us to grow old. It leaves us more tolerant. 

We're not allowed to demand more life, but we can at least ask for more light. So I intend to be 

cool-headedly rational about it all. I'm going to keep Reason on her throne. I'm going to be a bitter-

ender, in at least one thing: I'm going to stick to my Dinky-Dunk to the last ditch. I'm going to patch 

up the old top and forget the old scars. For we're in the same schooner, and we must make the 

most of it. And if I have to eat a man of extraordinarily serene and well-balanced mind, was rather 

excitable and impulsive. His tones and gestures are vehement; where another man would be 

content to protest against what he thought an undeserved act of homage by simply keeping his hat 

on, Falkland rams his down upon his head with both his hands. He goes most ardently with the 

popular party through the early stages of the revolution; then he somewhat abruptly breaks away 

from it, disgusted with its defects, though they certainly did not exceed those of other parties under 

the same circumstances, and feeling in himself no power to control it

going to dig away at that pot until its bottom is scraped clean. I'm going to remain the neck-or-

nothing woman I once prided myself on being. I'm even going to overlook Dinky-Dunk's casual 

cruelty in announcing, when I half-jokingly inquired why he preferred other women to his own 

Better-Half, that no horse eats hay after keep it in the right path. He is under the influence of 

others, first of Hampden and then of Hyde, to an extent hardly compatible with the possession of a 

mind of first-rate power. When he is taxed with inconsistency for going round upon the Bill for 

removing the Bishops from Parliament, his plea is that at the time when
