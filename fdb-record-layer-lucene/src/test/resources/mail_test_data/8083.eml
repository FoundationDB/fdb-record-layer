philodendron monstera smashed and hanging limp. My men rushed out and I tol=

 was wrapped up in an emergency bandage, and a stretcher was coming down fr=

used up. Our chief source of supply of dry wood is from the smashed-up chat=
eaux. Langhof, my=20

home, has been punished almost every day, and after the bombardment lets up=
 men from the=20

neighborhood come to collect the wood torn up by the shelling. The men of t=
he Tenth East Yorks=20

came up this morning and climbed to the remains of the second story, rippin=
g up the floor boards.=20

The enemy evidently saw them, for the shelling soon started. We have been s=
helled often here=20

before, but it was nothing compared to this. The shells were carefully plac=
ed and came over with=20

disgusting regularity. The buildings rocked and the whole neighborhood shoo=
k. Fountains of=20

bricks, mortar, and dirt were spewed up into the air. Trees were torn to sh=
reds, a wall in front of=20

me was hit--and disappeared, a lead statue of Apollo in the garden was hurl=
ed through the air and=20

landed fifty yards away crumpled up against the balustrade of the moat.  We=
 were in our cellars,=20

and gradually the shelling crept up towards us. Slowly a solemn dread which=
 soon moulded into a=20

sordid fear took possession of my being. In a flash I began to devise a phi=
losophy of death for my=20

chances were fading with every crash. I took out my pocketbook, containing =
some letters from my=20

mother and some personal things, and put them on one of the beams, so that,=
 being in another=20

part of the building, they might perhaps be found a scale of any magnitude;=
 for, a few years later,=20

Newcomen and Crawley invented the first engine with a cylinder and piston; =
and Savary,=20

abandoning his own, united with them in bringing their engine into use.  As=
 steam drives out air,=20

the principle of this engine was to let steam into the cylinder beneath the=
 piston, where (the piston=20

having risen to the top of the cylinder) a jet of cold water[22] condensed =
the steam, produced a=20

vacuum, and the piston, working air tight, descended by the pressure of the=
 atmosphere upon it,=20

this pressure being a weight of nearly fifteen pounds to each square inch; =
so that if the cylinder=20

were two feet diameter, it would amount to a weight of three tons.  This mo=
de of operation=20

prevailed for about fifty years, and though much used to pump water from mi=
nes, was found to=20

have great inconveniences and defects; till, in the year 1762, Mr. Watt, be=
ing employed to repair a=20

working-model of an engine at the University of Glasgow, was led to direct =
his mind to the=20

improvement of the machine; and from his experiments sprung the most essent=
ial change, viz. the=20

condensation of the steam in the cylinder, by opening a communication with =
a separate vessel,=20

into which the injection of cold water was made, thus allowing the cylinder=
 to remain hot.  On=20

opening that communication, the steam instantly rushes to the cold, or rath=
er is destroyed by=20


_
dropped completely round the cellars, demolishing nearly everything in sigh=
t. The enemy evidently=20

wanted to obliterate the whole place. The smell of the smoke and the dirt f=
rom the debris was=20

choking, and every minute we expected to be our last. Suddenly it stopped. =
Philosophy and fear=20

disappeared simultaneously as I sputtered out a choking laugh of relief. Th=
en Hawkins, my=20

servant, in a scared voice started, and the others joined in, singing the o=
ld marching refrain of the=20

Training Camps:--       "Hail, hail, the gang's all here,     What the hell=
 do we care!     What the hell=20

do we care!     Hail, hail, the gang's all here,     What the hell do we ca=
re NOW!"   When a man has=20

lived night after night in a trench, he gradually finds it quite possible t=
o snatch a good night's sleep.=20

In other words, it is merely a case of becoming acclimated to rackets, smel=
ls and food. I had=20

always been able to sleep, but on the night following the bombardment of th=
e chateau I just could=20

not doze off. I thrashed about continuously, and while in this restless sta=
te harbored the notion that=20

trouble was brewing for me. Every one has had that feeling, the feeling tha=
t hangs in your bones=20

and warns you to watch out. Well, that is how I felt.  At last the sun rose=
 and with it came a=20

beautiful morning, warm and sunny. I walked out its heat, and the vacuum th=
us made allows the=20

piston to descend as before mentioned.  [Illustration: _Pl. I._]  [Illustra=
tion: _Pl. II._]  [Illustration:=20

_Pl. III._]  [Illustration: _Pl. IV._]  Mr. Watt soon added the airpump to =
the condenser, to extract the=20

air extricated from the water in boiling, together with the water injected.=
  The next step was to=20

close the upper end of the cylinder, the piston-rod working through a tight=
 packing to exclude the=20

air, letting the steam in above, as well as below the piston, by an alterna=
te communication, and=20

then condensing it in both cases alternately, thus producing a double strok=
e; at the same time=20

deriving some aid from the expansive force of the steam on the side of the =
piston opposite to the=20

vacuum. This is essentially the form of all the engines in use at the prese=
nt day. The minor parts=20

devised by Mr. Watt, as the working of the valves, &c. were such as would r=
eadily occur to a=20

scientific mechanician.  While he was bringing the engine to its present pe=
rfection, and furnishing it=20

for the numerous mines, manufactories, and breweries in Great Britain, vari=
ations were devised by=20

Cartwright, by Hornblower, Woolf, and others in England, and more recently =
by Evans and by=20

Ogden in America, evincing much ingenuity, but (with the exception of Evans=
's, which is a simple=20

the shelling of the previous day. I was waiting for the stew which was cook=
ing on a little fire near=20

the side of the cellar. The "dixie" was resting on two old bayonets, and th=
ey in turn rested on bricks=20

at either side. Towards noon a big shell came over and landed in the moat, =
covering everything=20

around pressure) making the machine more complex.  Watt and Bolton's engine=
, as most=20

generally used, being properly an atmospheric engine, or working with steam=
 so low as merely to=20

produce a vacuum in the cylinder, became of enormous dimensions, when the p=
ower required was=20

that of an hundred horses: a scale of=20


_
followed by another, arriving in the part of the ruins where once a cow-she=
d stood. I was talking to=20

Hawkins, my batman, when I saw him dive across my front and fall flat on hi=
s face. At the same=20

time I was in the center of an explosion, a great flame of light and then b=
ricks, wood and cement=20

flew in all directions. For a few seconds I thought I was dead, then I pick=
ed myself up and saw that=20

blood was pouring down the front of my jacket. I followed used the labour o=
f that animal, and=20

preferred to substitute the steam-engine.  It had not, however, escaped the=
 notice of Mr. Watt, that=20

there existed in steam another source of power besides that of atmospheric =
pressure. The=20

experiments of his learned friend, Dr. Black, of Glasgow, as well as those =
of the French chemists,=20

and of Papin, in the instance of his digester, had ascertained the laws of =
its expansive force, and=20

amongst other interesting=20
