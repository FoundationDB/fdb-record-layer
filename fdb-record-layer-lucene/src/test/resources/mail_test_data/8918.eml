 he was only too sure that=20

he did see. Then: "What is it you want me to do for you, Mr. Hathaway? You =
have told me once,=20

but I'm afraid I didn't grasp it fully."  "Fix it with Gantry, or somebody,=
 so that we can put the=20

company vote where it's most needed and get our rate continued. It's simple=
 enough."  "The=20

simplicity is beyond question." Blount returned the list of stockholders an=

pencil-sharpening. "It is quite elementary, as you say; but there is anothe=

which seems to have escaped you. Are you aware that the present arrangement=
 which you have=20

so accurately described, and the continuance of it which you are proposing,=
 are crimes for which=20

It is located on the eastern end of an island which is a part of the narrow=
 neck of land which=20

divides Lake Menzaleh from the Mediterranean. It was thought when it was la=

become a considerable city; but it has not yet realized this expectation, t=
hough it has now a=20

population of over seventeen thousand. Six thousand of this number are Euro=
peans, the French=20

predominating. The making of the harbor, or "Grand Basin Ismail" as it is c=
alled, was another=20

difficult task for the canal company; for it has an area of 570 acres, whic=
h had to be excavated to=20

the depth of twenty-six feet by dredging.  The Guardian-Mother, followed by=
 the Maud, passed=20

through the channel, which is marked by red and green lights, to the basin,=
