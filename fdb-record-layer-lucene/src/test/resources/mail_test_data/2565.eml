philodendron monstera crowded into places along the wall.  A few moments later, standing in the centre of the floor and alone, were Thea Thompson and Carlo Navara.

When Sonya and her husband finally reached the Red Cross headquarters, already the large 

building was lighted, as the darkness fell early in the winter afternoons.  Going unannounced into 

the big reception room they found it fairly crowded. The room must have been fifty feet in length 

and nearly equally wide and extended from the front of the building to the rear.  In one end was a 

giant Christmas tree, left over from the Christmas celebration for the soldiers which in honor of 

New Year's eve was again lighted with a hundred white candles according to a German custom. 

There were few other lights in the room.  Up against the walls were double rows of chairs in which 

a number of persons were seated. Others were dancing in the centre of the floor.  Immediately 

Mrs. Arthur Adams, who was in charge of the Red Cross headquarters, came forward to speak to 

Dr. and Mrs. Clark. She was accompanied by Major James Hersey, who had entirely recovered 

from his attack of influenza and was now in command of his battalion in Coblenz.  A little later, 

after they had secured chairs, Bianca Zoli and Dr. Raymond joined them.  Nona Davis was 

dancing with Sergeant Donald Hackett, Thea Thompson with Carlo Navara.  Sonya noticed no one 

else at the moment Until proven differently, of course, but that takes a lot of doing. And he goes off 

half-cocked a lot of times. He doesn't stop to analyze situations very closely."  "That's what I was 

afraid of. Well, you tell him you don't have any control over my labor relations. Tell him to bring his 

gripes to me."         *       *       *       *       *  At sixteen-thirty, Doris Rives came in, finding him still at 

his desk.  "I have the written tests all finished, and I have about twenty of the tests and interviews 

completed," she said. "I'll have to evaluate the results, though. I wonder if there's a vacant desk 

around here, anywhere, and a record player."  "Yes, sure. Ask Joan to fix you up; she'll find a 

place for you to work. And if you're going to be working late, I'll order some dinner for you from the 

cafeteria. I'm going to be here all evening, myself."  Sid Keating came in, a short while later, 

peeling out of his overcoat, jacket and shoulder holster.  "I don't think they got everything out of 

that reactor," he said. "Radioactivity's still almost active-normal--about eight hundred REM's--and 

the temperature's away up, too. That isn't lingering radiation; that's prompt radiation." 

"Radioactivity hasn't dropped since morning; I'd

Yes, there standing up against the wall was Nora Jamison, with the little French girl's hand in hers 

and a line of children on either side.  Nona Davis changing partners, Sergeant Donald Hackett 

went over evidently to ask Nora Jamison to dance with him, but she must have declined as he 

continued standing beside her, laughing and talking.  "Have you been dancing, Bianca?" Sonya 

inquired. "You usually enjoy it so much."  Leaning over, Bianca whispered.  "Please don't discuss 

the question said. "What are they getting on the breakdown counter?"  "Mostly neutrons and 

alpha-particles. I talked to Fred Hausinger, the maintenance boss; he doesn't like it, either."  "Well, 

I'm no nuclear physicist," Melroy disclaimed, "but all that alpha stuff looks like a big chunk of Pu-

239 left inside. What's Fred doing about it?"  "Oh, poking around inside the reactor with 

telemetered scanners and remote-control equipment. When I left, he had a gang pulling out 

graphite blocks with RC-tongs.

recently, only Major Hersey and Dr. Raymond earlier in the afternoon. Dr. Raymond dances 

abominably."  "Not Carlo?" Sonya demanded.  And Bianca shook her head.  Something of their 

whispered conversation Hugh Raymond must have guessed.  "We are not to have any more of the 

ordinary dancing just at present, Mrs. Clark. Miss Thompson and Carlo Navara are to do a folk 

dance together."  Just as he was speaking, it much before thirteen-hundred tomorrow." He 

unzipped a bulky brief case he had brought in under his arm and dumped papers onto his desk. "I 

still have this stuff to get straightened out, too."  "Had anything to eat? Then call the cafeteria and 

have them send up three dinners. Dr. Rives is eating here, too. Find out what she wants; I want 

pork chops."  "Uh-huh; Li'l Abner Melroy; po'k chops unless otherwise
