forgotten to correct an incidental allusion is natural enough; and that Ral=
eigh in person discovered=20

Virginia _was_ commonly believed. Sir Walter Scott, for instance, believed =
it, as appears by a=20

passage at the end of _Kenilworth_. But the very title-page of Hariot's acc=
ount of the discovery of=20

Virginia (whether in the English of 1588, or the Frankfort Latin of 1590), =
negatives the idea of=20

Raleigh assisting in person. And the _Biographia Britannica_, or, I believe=
, any similar work of=20

authority, will show that no biographer of note has affirmed it. It was an =
expedition _fitted out_ by=20

Raleigh which discovered Virginia.      M.  It appears by the _Historie of =
Travaile into Virginia=20

Britannia_, by Strachey, so ably edited by Mr. Major for the Hakluyt Societ=
y, that Sir Walter=20

Raleigh sent out his first expedition to Virginia in 1584, under Captain Am=
adas; in 1585 a fleet=20

under Sir R. Grenville, which he intended to have commanded in person, but =
jealousy at court=20

prevented him. In 1587 a second fleet was sent to Roanoak under Captain Whi=
te, in 1590 supplies=20

by Captain White, and in 1602 he sent Samuel Mace. Neither Oldys nor Cayley=
 mention his=20

having gone there; and as they carry on the events of his life pretty clear=
ly year by year, I think, in=20

 that he never was=20

LOUNGING IN PUBLIC]  Women should be careful as to the way in which they si=

who spreads her knees looks as awkward as the man who keeps his tightly tog=
ether. Recently it=20

became a fad in certain places for women to lounge in the street-car and to=

the other. Needless to say, really well-bred women did not follow the fad. =

When all seats are taken in a car and a woman enters, a gentleman will rise=

 by saying =E2=80=9CThank=20

you!=E2=80=9D cordially and audibly. Women are much criticized for taking s=
eats in cars without an=20

acknowledgment of the courtesy, and, undoubtedly, they often do. On the oth=
er hand, men as=20

frequently, by turning their backs, make acknowledgment impossible.  If the=
 car be full and a=20

woman enters carrying a baby in her arms, any girl or young matron present =
should resign her=20

seat to the burdened passenger, unless some masculine passenger has manline=
ss enough to do=20

so. To the credit of human nature, be it said that we have never seen a mot=
her with a child in her=20
