VY.  BY BENSON J. LOSSING.   CHAPTER VII.  Lieutenant Lawrence had gained g=
reat flows easily away amongst the cane-brakes, thickets of espinillo, tala=
 and =C3=B1andubay, and where from out the pajonales the half-wild horses b=
ound like antelopes, _
elder sisters (Past and Present) spun away briskly at the wonderful web of =
Time, which the=20

youngest (the Future) amused herself by tearing to pieces. Far down in Gian=
t-land, where the=20

roots began to shoot, was an ancient well, guarded by the good giant Mimir =
(Memory). There the=20

gods always went for a morning draught that should make them wise in their =
daily tasks, since this=20

was the well of wisdom.  On one occasion there was a disturbance in Asgard.=
 Loki, a bad spirit,=20

living there in disguise, had been playing tricks on the goddesses, and set=
ting the gods by the ears=20

through his mischief-making pranks, while leading them into many dangerous =
scrapes, though as=20

yet he had not been found out. His children, too, were just as bad as himse=
lf, his son Fenris=20

(Pain), a hideous howling wolf, being the terror of Asgard, while Hela, his=
 daughter (Death), was=20

more horrible than I can describe. Besides these, Loki had brought in other=
 bad spirits, and=20

altogether Asgard was greatly disturbed. Odin himself did not know what to =
do. He asked the=20

Nornas, but they could not answer, although the youngest hinted that if her=
 lips had not been=20

sealed she could have told something. At last he determined to see Mimir, a=
nd take a drink from=20

his well. Saddling his eight-footed horse Sleipnir, away he rode in the nig=
ht, all alone, over the=20

Rainbow Bridge that joins Asgard with Earth, down to dark Giant-land. He ha=
d often before been=20

there to consult Mimir; for although Odin was very wise, Mimir was wiser st=
ill, since he guarded the=20

source of wisdom.  The giant was sitting deep in thought by the well, his w=
hite beard flowing down=20

far below his waist, which was clasped by a girdle graven with curious char=
acters, as old as the=20

world. He heard Odin coming, and rising to meet him, said this was just wha=
t he had known must=20

happen; for what else could have been expected with such a set as Loki and =
his family living in=20

Asgard? The first thing to be done, he said, was to cast them out from amon=
g the mouse he eat=20

him; you go bed sleep, get up, and soon quite well.=E2=80=9D  Tean, who by =
this time had changed position=20

with his friend, and become out of his knowledge a philosopher, shook his h=
ead sadly and replied,=20

=E2=80=9CYou no savey nothing, John; when black man know he die there is no=
 hope. Suppose cat he=20

catch mouse, all no use; mouse go change into a big, black cloud, all the s=
ame rain.  Rain fall=20

upon me, and each drop burn right into my bones.  I die, John, glad I see y=
ou; black man all die,=20

black woman no catch baby, tribe only fifty =E2=80=99stead of five hundred.=

smoke, we vanish, go up somewhere, into the clouds. Black men and white men=
, he no can live.=20

New Caledonia (as you call him) not big enough for both.=E2=80=9D  What hap=
pened after that Higginson=20

never told, for when he reached that point he used to break out into a torr=
ent of half French, half=20

English oaths, blaspheme his gods, curse progress, rail at civilization, an=
d recall the time when all=20

the tribe were happy, and he and Tean in their youth went spearing fish.  A=
nd then bewildered,=20

and as if half-conscious that he himself had been to blame, would say, =E2=

, il me faisait de la peine . .=20

plit by a hundred islands, forms a sort=20

e Ibicuy, spreads out=20

flat, cut by a thousand channels, heavily timbered, shut in upon the landwa=
rd side by a long range=20

of hills of dazzling sand, and buried everywhere in waving masses of tall g=
rass.  Grass, grass, and=20

yet more grass.  Grass at all seasons of the year, so that the half-wild ho=
rses never know the=20

scarcity of pasture which in the winter makes them lean and rough upon the =
outside plains.  A=20

district shut by its sand-hills=20

place far away.  What do you suppose this advice cost? Giant-land, you know=
, was very dark, and=20

although the well was full of wisdom, Mimir had not always light enough to =
read its secrets. Odin's=20

eye was the sun; so Mimir was glad enough to give his horn of water for a d=
aily loan of Odin's=20

glowing eye, while Odin was willing thus to buy the advice that should make=
 Asgard happy=20

paradise for horses, cattle, tigers, myriads of birds, for capibaras, nutri=
as, and for the stray Italians=20
