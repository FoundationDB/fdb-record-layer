of their wedding, still hung up in Grant's shop, while their old one, faded=
 and patched, still kept its=20

place in front of their fire. But these family matters were things which th=
e Franks never cared to=20

talk of to others; they had given the gold with cheerful hearts, as a joint=
-offering to the Lord; and=20

though it was more from them than a thousand pounds would have been from Si=
r Lacy Barton,=20

they never thought that there was any merit in the little sacrifice which t=
hey had made.  "I dare=20

say," continued Ben Stone, "that Mr. Claudius Leyton is a fine scholar, but=
 he's no more fitted for=20

parish work than a gimlet is to saw through a plank." While the carpenter w=
as picking holes in the=20

curate's preaching, he was at the same time, unconsciously of course, picki=
ng another with the=20

end of his stick in Persis's unfortunate rug. "Why, he's afraid of the soun=
d of his own voice, and=20

can't so much as touch his hat to you, without blushing up to his eyes. It =
was rare fun to see him=20

yesterday. He came to my workshop in the morning, to ask me where he could =
find Mrs. Sands,=20

the wife of our clerk. 'Now,' thinks I, 'I know well enough why you want to=
 visit Nancy. She showed=20

in the face of half the village yesterday, that she had had a drop too much=
, and you think that it's a=20

parson's business to reprove as well as to teach. But if you ever screw up =
your courage to rebuke=20

Nancy Sands, I'll give my new hatchet for a two-penny nail!' I told the you=
ng parson where Sands's=20

cottage lay, just in sight of my own, and I watched him as he slowly walked=
 towards it. I'd half a=20

mind to go after him, and see how such a lamb of a shepherd would manage su=
ch a vixen of a=20

sheep. I marked him shaking his head slightly as he walked, as if he were c=
onning over what he=20

should say; and though I could only see his back, I could just fancy the an=
xious, uneasy look on=20

his smooth young face."  "Poor young clergyman!" said Persis. "He was about=
 the most painful of=20

all a minister's duties. I should be very sorry myself to have to rebuke Na=
ncy Sands."  "Something=20

like having to pull out a tigress's teeth!" laughed Ben Stone, who had succ=
eeded in making a large=20

hole out of a very little one in the old rug. "But Mr. Leyton never got so =
far as the pulling! I watched=20

him, would you believe it, walk three times up and down before the gate of =
Nancy's little garden; it=20

was clear he couldn't screw up his courage to go in. Then she chanced to co=
me out of her door.=20

Maybe she was wondering why the parson took that bit of road for his quarte=
r-deck walk, or she=20

guessed what he was after, and thought she would brave out the business."  =
"Do you know what=20

passed between the two?" inquired Franks.  "I saw Mr. Leyton raise his hat =
a bit, in his very polite=20

way, and Nancy drop a little saucy bob of a courtesy, as who should say, 'W=
hat have you come=20

here for?' and almost immediately afterwards the parson walked away a good =
deal quicker than he=20

had walked to the place. I was curious to know what had passed, so I put do=
wn my saw, and went=20

up the road to Nancy, who was still in her garden, pulling up groundsel; sh=
e has a rare crop of it=20

there, and little besides. 'What said the young parson to you, Nancy?' says=
 I. 'Oh!' says she, 'he=20

hummed and hawed a bit, and then told me--as if I didn't know it afore--tha=
t as his uncle is ill he=20

has come to this   IVOR DOES WHAT HE CAN FOR MAXINE  "How long a time do yo=
u think I=20

had been in this room, Monsieur," she asked, "before you--rather rudely, I =
must say--broke in upon=20

my conversation with my friend?"  "You had been here exactly three minutes,=
" replied the=20

Commissary of Police.  "As much as that? I should have thought less. We had=
 to greet each other,=20

after having been parted for many months; and still, in the three minutes, =
you believe that we had=20

time to concoct a plot of some sort, and to find some safe corner--all the =
while in semi-darkness--

for the hiding of a thing important to the police--a bomb, perhaps? You mus=
t think us very clever."=20

"I know that you are very clever, Mademoiselle."  "Perhaps I ought to thank=
 you for the=20



compliment," she answered, allowing anger to warm her voice at last; "but t=
his is almost beyond a=20

joke. A woman comes to the rooms of a friend. Both of them are so placed th=
at they prefer her call=20

not to be talked about. For that reason, and for the woman's sake, the frie=
nd chooses to take a=20

name that isn't his--as he has a right to do. Yet, just because that woman =
happens unfortunately to=20

be well-known--her face and name being public property--she is followed, sh=
e is spied upon,=20

humiliated, and all, no doubt, on account of some silly mistake, or malicio=
us false information. Ah,=20

it is shameful, Monsieur! I wonder the police of Paris can stoop to such st=
upidity, such meanness."=20

"When we have found out that it is a mistake, the police of Paris will apol=
ogise to you,=20

Mademoiselle, through me," said the Commissary; "until then, I regret if ou=
r duty makes us=20

disagreeable to you." Then, turning to his two gendarmes, he directed them =
to search the room,=20

beginning with all possible places in which a paper parcel or large envelop=
e might be hidden,=20

within ten metres of the spot where Mademoiselle and Monsieur had stood tal=
king together when=20

the police opened the door.  Maxine did not protest again. With her head up=
, and a look as if the=20

three policemen were of no more importance to her than the furniture of the=
 room, she walked to=20

the mantelpiece and stood leaning her elbow upon it. Weariness, disgusted i=
ndifference, were in=20

her attitude; but I guessed that she felt herself actually in need of the p=
hysical support.  The two=20

gendarmes moved about in noiseless obedience, their faces expressionless as=
 masks. They did=20

not glance at Maxine, giving themselves entirely to the task at which they =
had been set. But their=20

superior officer did not once take his eyes from the pure profile she turne=
d scornfully towards him.=20

I knew why he watched her thus, and thought of a foolish, child's game I us=
ed to play twenty years=20

ago, at little-boy-and-girl parties: the game of "Hide-the-Handkerchief." W=
hile one searched for the=20

treasure, those who knew where it was stood by, saying: "Now you are warm. =
Now you are hot--

boiling hot. Now you are cool again. Now you are ice cold." It was as if we=
 were five players at this=20

game, and Maxine de Renzie's white, deathly smiling face was expected to pr=
oclaim against her=20

will: "Now you are warm. Now you are hot. Now you are ice cold."  There was=
 a table in the middle=20

of the room, with one or two volumes of photographs and brightly-bound guid=
e books of Paris=20

upon it, as well as my hat and gloves which I had tossed down as I came in.=
 The gendarmes=20


_
that I must remember;' and at that he stuck and stammered and blushed, so I=
 took him up sharp,=20

and I says,--says I (Ben Stone mimicked the insolent toss of Nancy's head a=
s he repeated her=20

words), 'Yes, I remember this aint the first time as you've been at Colme; =
your mother brought you=20

to the vicarage afore you was out of petticoats; that aint so very long ago=
.'"  "How could she?"=20

exclaimed Persis Franks; but Ben went on with his story.  "'And so,' contin=
ued Nancy, 'he was put=20

down in a moment and took himself off. I guessed what he'd come after, and =
I wasn't going to be=20

lectured and preached to by a smooth-faced boy like that!'" Ben burst into =
a hoarse laugh, as if he=20

thought the discomfiture of the youthful minister a very good jest; neither=
 of his hearers joined in=20

his mirth.  "Why, you don't seem to see the fun of it," cried Ben Stone; "b=
ut if you'd heard Nancy=20

Sands, you'd have laughed as I do. The old tigress is more than a match for=
 the shy young=20

blushing boy of a parson."  Ben stopped suddenly short, for there was table=
; peeped behind the=20

silk cushions on the sofa, opened the doors and drawers of a bric-a-brac ca=
binet and a small=20

writing desk, lifted the corners of the rugs on the bare, polished floor; a=
nd finally, bowing apologies=20

to Maxine for disturbing her, took out the logs from the fireplace where th=
e fire was ready for=20

lighting, and pried into the vases on the mantel. Also they shook the silk =
and lace window curtains,=20

and moved the pictures on the walls. When all this had been done in vain, t=
he pair confessed with=20

shrugs of the shoulders that they were at a loss.  During the search, which=
 had been conducted in=20

silence, I had a curious sensation, caused by my intense sympathy with Maxi=
ne's suffering. I felt=20

as if my heart were the pendulum of a clock which had been jarred until it =
was uncertain whether=20

to go on or stop. Once, when the gendarmes were peering under the sofa, or =
behind the sofa=20

cushions, a grey shadow round Maxine's eyes made her beautiful face look li=
ke a death-mask in=20

the white electric light, which did not=20
