 Slowly approaching them was a woman in a pink dress, holding her head down=
.  "Now, Tom," whispered Garden. "It will be over in a moment or two. For G=

Dearie a hug, and knitting her brows, "there's no way of spending any more =
money.  We've made=20

our original investment."  "The initial cost," Dearie corrected.  "We've  "=
There! there!" cried Tom,=20

struggling to release himself; but Garden held him fast. Tom's voice trembl=
ed from excitement,=20

and his face was white. "I saw her this very minute."  "Saw whom?"  "The wo=
man in the blue=20

dress," cried Tom. "Let me go, sir! let me go!"=20

"Yes, and we've bought our own bonds," Skinner added.  "And they'll pay bet=
ter than any old=20

bank," cried Honey.  Then quickly, "But we won't buy any more!"  "There are=
 other financial stunts=20

besides putting money in the bank," observed Skinner.  "Look at Lewis.  He =
invested in himself."=20

"Just as we're doing," Honey broke in.  "Er--not precisely," Skinner qualif=
ied.  "But his investment=20

has already returned self-respect, social opportunity, enhanced efficiency.=
"  "And he has n't half as=20

much brains as you have!"  "I don't know about that," said Skinner, rather =
dubiously.  "Anyhow,=20

what he's got are live ones."  Then, after a pause, "Look here, Honey, we d=
on't need to worry.=20

We've already invested so much.  It's going to continue to bring us in good=
 things--and it is n't=20

going to cost us any more."  "No, indeed, it isn't, Dearie.  I'll see to th=
at!" said Honey with firmness.=20

"And I 'll see to it that you _see_ to it.  That'll double cinch it," said =
Skinner.  Honey held up a=20

finger; then turned and listened.  "That's the postman's whistle.  I'll go.=
"  A exultation. "Keep still,=20

keep still! Remember you have promised to obey me implicitly."  "I saw her,=
 I tell you!" cried Tom,=20

shaking all over, but ceasing to struggle. "And now she has disappeared!"  =
"As she did on the=20

night of the murder?"  "Yes, as she did then."  "But you saw her again?"  "=
Yes, I saw her again."=20

"But not in the same spot?"  "No," said Tom, turning in another direction. =
"This way."  He walked=20

on fifty or sixty yards, and Garden, holding his arm more lightly, accompan=
ied him.  "Why do you=20

stop, Tom?"  "Because I saw her in that clump the second time."  Garden too=

Tom's arm and stepped behind him. Again he took his white handkerchief from=
 his pocket.  "Are=20

you quite sure you are not mistaken, Tom?"  "It isn't possible for me to be=
 mistaken," said Tom.=20

Garden once more waved his handkerchief in the air. "There! there! There sh=

right!" shouted Garden, as though he were addressing some person in the dis=
tance. Racing after=20
