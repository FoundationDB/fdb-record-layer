for even so interesting a subject as stockbreeding. But Lucy had noted, out=
 of the corner of her=20

watchful eye, the arrival of Miss Grains, indignant and perspiring.  "You'l=
l excuse him, Miss=20

Warrender, it's more thoughtlessness than want of manners; but he oughtn't =
to be taking up your=20

time like this," cried the brewer's daughter, as she bore off her reluctant=
 prize. To this day nothing=20

will ever persuade the buxom mother of farmer Wurzel's fine young family th=
at her William was not=20

actually audacious enough to propose to Miss Lucy Warrender, and that his a=
ttentions were=20

favourably received. So often has poor William Wurzel been twitted on this =
matter that he has=20

come to look upon himself as a very Lothario, rescued at the right moment. =
 In the drawing-room=20

things went on much as they always do in country drawing-rooms in the hot w=
eather. The girls=20

sang; Miss Hood, their chaperon, played the inevitable Chopin; but (as, unl=
ike zoophites,=20

chaperons cannot be cut in two pieces, and yet live) Miss Hood felt it her =
duty to leave Lucy, and=20

to follow into the verandah Haggard and his _fiancee_. Perhaps, after all, =
this may have been=20

rather a relief to the lovers, for they had had a long innings that day, no=
 one having presumed to=20

disturb the numerous _tetes-a-tete_ of the engaged couple.  Squire Warrende=
r sat asleep in his=20

chair, his face covered by a big brown bandanna, so that actually Spunyarn =
and Lucy were=20

practically alone. But the young lord didn't attempt to renew his attention=
s to Lucy. In his own mind=20

Spunyarn perhaps felt that he was well out of it. Lucy, a past-mistress in =
the art of flirtation, was=20

delicious as a friend; as a sweetheart there would have been two sides to t=
he question; but Lucy=20

Warrender as a wife would have been simply appalling and impossible. Lucy's=
 bygone escapade=20

with her uncle's second footman--for failing high game, Lucy Warrender was =
not above captivating=20

even a second footman--had been carefully hushed up. It was the cause of th=
e poor young man's=20

receiving a month's wages on the spot and his dismissal. For Miss Hood had =
detected him in=20

passing a very pink-looking letter to Lucy Warrender. Pinker far than the l=
etter were the face and=20

ears of the guilty domestic, as he placed the intercepted missive in Miss H=
ood's hands, on her=20

sternly ordering him to do so. Of course the letter was shown to Mr. Warren=
der; he was very angry=20

under the circumstances. But the letter of the unfortunate Joseph, though i=
t had caused him many=20

agonies in its composition, was comic in the extreme. It was full of what t=
he writer called "pottery;"=20

it was the poor young fellow's first love letter. Alas, it was a mere answe=
r to a letter of Lucy's;=20

_she_ had commenced the correspondence; it was she who had thrown the handk=
erchief.=20

Needless to say Lucy was deported at once, and Madame Planchette's, _nee_ J=
ones, finishing=20

establishment in the Champs Elysees received a fresh pupil. Lucy's _minaude=
ries_ could now only=20

be practised on her own sex. But even there the girl succeeded in setting t=
he whole house by the=20

ears; and causing the sudden dismissal of the Italian professor, a gifted P=
iedmontese, with a=20

gigantic head of black curly hair and long but dirty nails. At the end of a=
 year she returned to her=20

uncle's roof, having achieved an intimate acquaintance with French _argot_;=
 her accent, however,=20

was undeniable. Miss Warrender, too, now added to her already dangerous fas=
cinations the=20

charms of a French manner and a Parisian accent. But her persistent secret =
studies of the works=20

of Flaubert, Zola and Co. probably had not improved her mind. As soon as Mi=
ss Hood left the=20

room, Lucy seized the opportunity, on finding herself thus practically alon=
e with Lord Spunyarn, to=20

give him a rather florid rendering of "_C'est dans le nez que ca me chatoui=
lle_," in which she out-

heroded Herod, and was even more piquante and suggestive than Madame Chaumo=
nt herself.=20

However, it did Spunyarn at all events no harm, French being a sealed book =
to him. The strains of=20



the syren at last woke her uncle, and brought back Miss Hood, who suggested=
 that it was late.=20

And the party broke up at last at her instigation.       CHAPTER III.    TH=
E VILLAGE DORCAS.=20

The big room at King's Warren Parsonage was already fairly well filled. Old=
 Mrs. Wurzel and the=20

buxom but not too well-favoured heiress of the house of Grains were at the =
head of the table. Old=20

Mrs. Wurzel was a personage in her way; she it was who made the annual cont=
ract with the local=20

linen-draper; she it was who, as an adept learned in the art, officiated at=
 the awful ceremony of=20

"cutting-out"; she it was who, with infinite trouble, obtained for the scho=
ol children those antiquated=20

straw bonnets of a forgotten type, which were the despair of the juvenile v=
illage beauties. She=20

herself had worn them in her youth, and they were the proper bonnets for "g=
rowing girls." But,=20

alas! Nemesis had arrived; the head coverings worn in country places thirty=
 years ago had=20

become once more the fashion, and the little maids from school had been vot=
ed by Spunyarn=20

"quite smart people." It was Mrs. Wurzel who with her own fair but energeti=
c hands had, with her=20

famous cutting-out scissors, shorn away the luxuriant but obnoxious fringe =
which Jemima Ann=20

Blogg, the poacher's daughter, had appeared in at the Confirmation. Jemima =
Ann had violently=20

resisted, but her struggles were in vain; in this case the sheep had not be=
en dumb when in the=20

hands of the shearer: the daughter of the village Radical had returned to h=
er father's roof weeping,=20

but shorn. It is true that old Mrs. Wurzel had reluctantly paid to Blogg th=
e sum of five pounds,=20

under the threat of a summons for assault, but the honest fellow had honour=
ably kept her secret=20

as he had promised, and Mrs. Wurzel's reputation, as the champion of virtue=
 and respectability,=20

had in no way suffered, though she had paid her five pounds for it.  The vi=
car's wife, whose=20

principal characteristics were her interest in missionary work and the sali=
ency of her angles, was a=20

mere priestess in the little circle of which old Mrs. Wurzel was the perman=
ent archdruidess. Vicars'=20

wives had come and gone, but all had submitted, some after a brief struggle=
, to old Mrs. Wurzel's=20

sway. But Mrs. Dodd, the present vicar's wife, retained the precious prerog=
ative of choosing the=20

book to be read at the monthly Dorcas. Mrs. Dodd's choice was invariably th=
e biography of some=20

missionary; and she did her best to carry out the idea that a Dorcas meetin=
g should provide self-

mortification for the ladies present, in the shape of coarse work for the f=
ingers and repellent=20

reading for the mind.  The village Dorcas was that happy neutral ground whe=
re the various ranks=20

of society met on an equality. Here might be seen the three good-looking an=
d well-educated=20

daughters of the local draper. Nice girls these, but under the baleful shad=
ow, the bitter blight of=20

trade. For country places are very conservative: the squire looks down on t=
he yeoman, the doctor=20

and the lawyer, all three of whom consider themselves considerably taller i=
n social stature than the=20

tenant farmer, who in his turn will eat no bread and drink no water in the =
houses of those=20

Rechabites, the tradesmen. All these people, however, join in despising the=
 rich stockbroker who=20

has recently purchased the pretentious place which he calls "The Park;" the=
 gates of which are=20

almost celestial, being of bright gilded iron work. The unfortunate inhabit=
ant of "The Park,"=20

notwithstanding his well-appointed barouche and his men in livery, is but a=
 pariah. For not a year=20

ago, till the big corner occurred in Mex. Rails in which he made his pile, =
little Sleek, of Sleek and=20

Dabbler, of Throgmorton Street, had "been to business" every morning. Sleek=
 now passes his time=20

in good works, he takes a great interest in local affairs, and, unless he f=
lings the whole matter up=20

in a rage, he may yet become a justice of the peace. Sleek finds it far har=
der work than fortune-

making; but he pursues his Will-o'-the-Wisp with untiring energy. So do we =
all. It is for this, that=20



Sleek contributes so liberally to the local charities. It is for this, that=
 the two Misses Sleek, clad in=20

shining raiment of needlework, are seated at the big table, pursuing the un=
romantic occupation of=20

hemming huckaback towels of a more than Spartan coarseness. But something h=
as been already=20

gained by the monthly martyrdom; Mrs. Dodd and her sister-in-law the ethere=
al Anastatia address=20

them as "dear," and they have a bowing acquaintance, which they energetical=
ly attempt to=20

increase, with, the Misses Warrender.  Within this charmed circle the veter=
inary surgeon's=20

womankind and the grocer's daughters also dare to tread, but they are there=
 merely on sufferance.=20

The line must be drawn somewhere, and the vicar's wife, as did her predeces=
sor, drew it at that=20

man of blood, the harmless Kubble, the local butcher. He and the rest of th=
ose shut out from=20

Paradise sought their enjoyment, and a perhaps more congenial society, at t=
hose buttery=20

banquets, the tea meetings of the local Little Bethel. Thus, as in most cou=
ntry places, Dissent was=20

at a premium among the humbler classes, and possibly the continued assertio=
n of their position by=20

the clergy of the State has had a good deal to do with the spread of Dissen=
t in other villages than=20

King's Warren.  There were at least a dozen ladies seated round the big tab=
le at the Parsonage.=20

Our friends Lucy and Georgina were among the number, their simple muslins s=
trikingly contrasting=20

with the more elaborate garments of the Misses Sleek. Anastatia Dodd flutte=
red (it is the only=20

word) round the workers, as they plied their busy needles; she "gave out" t=
he various garments, or=20

portions thereof, of mysterious shape; and as she did so whispered her litt=
le word of welcome, her=20

little chirrup of harmless gossip to each. Mrs. Dodd who sat at the bottom =
of the table as vice-

chairmaness, now opened a thick black book in which various markers of colo=
ured paper had=20

been inserted. "I think we are all here," she said, as she put on her spect=
acles in a determined=20

manner, and ominously cleared her throat. Nobody disputed this proposition;=
 the hum of=20

conversation ceased.  "I think we left off at the second appendix, which co=
ntained letters from the=20

wife of the lamented subject of the biography. I will now continue.        =

     INTRODUCTION.   In sending this little=20

work before the public, I have tried to remedy one fault which I have often=
 heard complained of,=20

namely, that knitting-books generally give so many more stitches than are r=
eally required. This is=20

partly owing to the different qualities of wool used by different knitters,=
 and partly also, to a certain=20

extent, whether the worker knits loosely or tightly. The following directio=
ns are for medium knitters.=20

As knitting sometimes shrinks in the washing, I should advise my readers to=
 try and knit=20

moderately loose. But, of course, the principal thing is to have the same s=
ized wool or silk as that=20

for which the directions are given; and this is especially important in soc=
ks and stockings. I will=20

therefore state that Charity wheeling is the thickest and most harsh kind o=
f yarn made; Scotch=20

wheeling is a trifle less coarse. Scotch fingering is the usual yarn sold f=
or socks and gentlemen=E2=80=99s=20

stockings: it ought to be very strong, and to appear about the same size as=
 Berlin. If it looks finer=20

(and some does) put on more stitches than are given. For couvrettes, and th=
ings of that kind, the=20

size of the wool and pins is, of course, a matter of less importance, as it=
 does not signify whether=20

the work is a trifle larger or smaller than intended; but in stockings, a s=
light thing makes a good=20

deal of difference in the fit.  I have also endeavoured to explain everythi=
ng at full length, so as to=20

enable inexperienced knitters to find out the patterns by themselves; the c=
ost of each article is put,=20

whenever possible, at the head of the pattern.     EXPLANATIONS.   =E2=80=
=98To purl or pearl=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98to=20

seam=E2=80=99 mean the same thing; that is, to put the wool round the right=
-hand needle. Thus: the wool=20

hangs straight down, it must be lifted and placed round the needle from rig=
ht to left. You must then=20

insert the right-hand needle into the stitch, exactly the opposite way as i=
n ordinary knitting.  =E2=80=98To=20

decrease=E2=80=99 is simply to knit two stitches together. Another way is t=
o slip a stitch, knit one, pass the=20

slipped stitch over it.  =E2=80=98To take two together=E2=80=99 means to kn=
it two together.  =E2=80=98To increase,=E2=80=99 you must=20

hear that Mr. Adams is now making some.     _General Remarks on Socks and S=
tockings._   For a=20

lady=E2=80=99s stocking it is best to decrease once and increase three time=
s for the calf of the leg. For a=20

gentleman=E2=80=99s this is unnecessary. Most of these directions are for r=
ibbed stockings, as they fit so=20

much better; but if preferred plain, of course the same number of stitches =
is required.  You must=20

always remember in ribbed stockings to carry on the ribs and seam-stitches =
all down the back of=20

the heel, until you begin to round it. The ribs on the front of the foot mu=
st be continued straight on,=20

until within an inch of the decreasing for the toe.  The seam-stitch is mad=
e by knitting a certain=20

stitch in two rounds and pearling it in the third.  Before decreasing for t=
he instep, do two or three=20

plain rounds and then begin.  The =E2=80=98flap,=E2=80=99 or heel before it=
 is rounded, ought to be three inches, or=20

even more, as a long heel wears better. It also makes it much stronger to k=
nit it double with=20

Angola wool, of the same colour as the knitting; it can be bought at any li=
nen-draper=E2=80=99s on wooden=20

reels for 2d. One reel does a pair.  Except for young boys, socks fit quite=
 well without being=20

decreased at all for the ankle; therefore I only give one pattern on the de=
creasing principle.  With=20

silk stockings the size of pins is important.     _Heel of a Stocking or So=
ck._   To inexperienced=20

knitters the heel seems to present mountains of difficulty, but in reality =
the mountain is but a mole-

hill after all. The following pattern is one of the best.  Divide your stit=
ches. We will say you have 50=20

altogether, on three needles: take 12 on each side of the seam-stitch, and =
knit these 25=20

backwards and forwards in rows, not rounds (making the seam-stitch all the =
same); you must pearl=20

backwards, so as to keep the knitting even. Continue until you have made a =
flap about three=20

inches long, always slipping the first knitted stitch. Now knit, from the r=
ight-hand side, the 12=20

stitches; then the seam-stitch, which from this time forward you cease to m=
ake. Knit 4 stitches=20

beyond it; knit 2 together; knit 1; turn, pearl until you get to 4 beyond t=
he seam-stitch, pearl 2=20

together, pearl 1, turn. Knit until you come to the stitch in the previous =
row where you turned=E2=80=94you=20

may know it easily by the little hole which was formed by the turning; you =
now knit 2 together and=20

knit one more stitch, then turn. Pearl the next row, of course always pearl=
ing 2 together where the=20

little hole has been left, and so on until you have gradually worked off th=
e stitches. You then pick=20

up the side-stitches of this flap and the heel is finished.     _To Decreas=
e for the Toe of a Sock or=20

Stocking._   Put half your stitches on one needle, a quarter on the second,=
 and a quarter on the=20

third needle. Thus: suppose you have 60 stitches, you must have 30 on one s=
ide and 15 on the=20

other two. The 30 must be the front or ribbed part, the two pins with 15 st=
itches on them ought to=20

be the sole part. In doubling your knitting now, the front part ought to li=
e evenly on the sole of the=20

foot. Begin to knit the 30 stitches; knit 27, slip 1, knit 1, pass the slip=
ped stitch over, knit 1. Now=20

begin the next pin; knit 1, knit 2 together. Continue plain knitting. Now b=
egin the 3rd pin; knit 12,=20

slip 1, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over, knit 1. Now you begin again o=
n the 30. Knit 1, knit 2=20

together. Continue plain. Do two rounds plain, and then decrease again in t=
he same manner 4=20

stitches in every round, leaving always 2 stitches between the decreasing, =
remembering always to=20



do two rounds of plain knitting between each decreasing round.  Repeat for =
two inches and cast=20

off.  Some people only do one round between the decreasing: this plan makes=
 the toe rounder and=20

more puckered.     _Decreasing for Instep._   On the right-hand side of the=
 heel, just where the ribs=20

leave off, you slip 1, knit 1; pass the slipped stitch over; continue plain=
 knitting; and where the ribs=20

begin again you knit 2 together. You must remember that on the right side o=
f the heel you slip, and=20

on the left that you knit 2 together.     _Lady=E2=80=99s Striped Silk Stoc=

(William told me afterwards that they were worth at least fifty     pounds)=
. On his head was the=20

second-hand hat of some _parvenu's_     coachman, gold lace, cockade and al=
l. Fancy my horror,=20

dear     Mary, my terror, indignation and astonishment, when I perceived   =
  that the rest of his=20

costume merely consisted of a thick layer     of palm oil, with which the w=
retch had covered his=20

disgusting     body. I saw no more; I need not say I fainted from the mingl=
ed     effects of terror,=20

indignation, and astonishment. On coming to,     William told me that the c=
ourtiers, some twenty in=20

number, wore     precisely the same costume, minus the hat and ear-rings.  =
    "'Such, dear Mary,=20

was the degraded condition of M'Bongo and his     court on our arrival; but=
 it has been my happy=20

lot (under     Providence) to change all this, and my endeavours have not b=

earthly reward. Only think, Mary, M'Bongo's     ear-rings are now my own, m=
y very own. They will=20

reach you by     the hands of Mr. Mackenzie, a worldly-minded Scotch mercha=

to earthly things. On no account, dear Mary, in     disposing of these pric=
eless treasures, have=20

anything to do with     the jewellers, who I am told are extremely dishones=
t persons.     You had=20

better try to sell them to the South Kensington Museum     as _curios_, or =
at some fashionable=20

bazaar; or failing these,     to some wealthy but unworldly person, who tak=
es an interest in     our=20

working in Africa. Do not forget to mention that they are     _royal_ ear-r=
ings.'"  Here one of the=20

Miss Sleeks coughed, but the broad grin on her face subsided instantly unde=
r the severe look=20

which Mrs. Dodd gave her over her spectacles. After a short pause and a sno=
rt of indignation, the=20

vicar's wife continued:      "'I have been the blessed instrument, dear Mar=
y, of a great work     in=20

this country. M'Bongo and his whole court are now clothed, I     am happy t=
o say, at least to a=20

certain extent. The greater     portion of the royal garments have been obt=
ained from me;=20

unfortunately I have been compelled to take payment in cattle     and grain=
. You remember my=20

scarlet rep underskirt, the one I     wore so much during our last winter i=
n dear old England; with a=20

little alteration at the waist, to which I have added a green     velvet co=
llar, and an additional=20

placket hole (through which the     royal arms are thrust), and wearing my =
galoshes, M'Bongo=20

attended service here yesterday for the first time. Both garment     and ga=
loshes were quite=20

useless to me in this hot country.     William was unable to persuade him t=
o remove the cockaded=20

hat,     which he, in his benighted way, looks upon as a royal crown; but  =
   as my husband's is the=20

only other hat in the country, this does     not perhaps much matter. Willi=
am has thus been happily=20

able to     report to the society the approaching conversion of M'Bongo and=
     his imminent=20

civilization. The poor king, however, complains     much of the heat, and I=
 am sorry to say only=20

wears these robes     on ceremonial occasions. Still it has been a great, g=
reat     comfort to us=20

both.                  "'Yours lovingly,                      "'AMELIA REES=
.'  "Many such interesting letters=20

were received from our self-sacrificing countrywoman up to the death of her=
 husband and fellow-

worker. The sad end of the mission to King M'Bongo has been narrated in the=
 body of this work.=20

But Mrs. Rees was loth to leave her sphere in Africa, and is now happily ma=
rried to Alonzo P.=20

Jones, an energetic coloured Baptist minister, of Cape Coast Castle."  Ther=
e was a universal sigh=20

of relief.  "I wonder whether she wears the ear-rings?" remarked the elder =
Miss Sleek pertly.=20

"Perhaps they were the attraction to Alonzo P. Jones," suggested her sister=
, as she triumphantly=20

folded and smoothed her second completed towel.  "It's always the way with =
them," sighed Miss=20

Grains, who suffered from a complication of romantic tendency and very tigh=
t stays. "It's the=20

money that attracts them, and possibly Mrs. Rees might have been Mrs. Rees =
to the end of the=20



chapter, if it hadn't been for the ear-rings and the sale of her old clothe=
s for countless flocks and=20

herds."  "Doubtless Miss Grains speaks from painful experience, my dears," =
retorted Mrs. Dodd,=20

with a severe look at her victim; "but you may be quite certain that the ac=
quisition of the ear-rings=20

and the sale of the clothes were but the blessed means to an end, a mere sp=
oiling of the=20

Egyptians, that _the work_ might progress."  "In fact, a robbing of Peter t=
o pay Paul," suggested=20

Lucy Warrender, but without raising her eyes from her work.  The needle of =
the archdruidress=20

broke, as she shook her head viciously at the scoffer. "Ah, my dear, you sh=
ouldn't laugh at sacred=20

things," said the elder lady.  "But I don't look upon Mrs. Rees as a sacred=
 thing," cried Lucy, not to=20

be intimidated.  "A person no one would wish to know," chimed in Miss Sleek=
.  "Ah, but think how=20

she loved the blacks, and gave herself up to them," cooed the vicaress, in =
a tone intended at the=20

same time to convey instruction and reproof.  "Nasty thing," retorted Lucy,=
 with biting sarcasm. "I=20

suppose it was because she loved the blacks and gave herself up to them, th=
at she married the=20

energetic negro ranter with the dreadful name."  This proved too much for M=
rs. Dodd. "I am=20

surprised and ashamed, Lucy Warrender, at your attempt to depreciate the no=
ble self-immolation=20

of dear Mrs. Jones. Of course it is a great privilege to be married to a cl=
ergyman, a very precious=20

privilege, but when he is a negro and a Baptist--hum--I suppose I must say =
clergyman, then a=20

woman's life must be indeed a martyrdom."  "I suppose he beats her?" asked =
one of the draper's=20

daughters of the experienced Mrs. Wurzel.  "I sincerely trust he does," bro=
ke in the irreverent=20

Lucy.  Just at this moment the door was hurriedly opened, and the Reverend =
John Dodd entered=20

the room. He was a stout man, his principal characteristics being an intens=
e pleasure in ladies'=20

society, and an obliviousness of the fact that he was no longer the pale sl=
im young curate of=20

earlier days. A life of almost absolute inactivity, which was forced upon h=
im by his wife's jealousy=20

of the rest of the sex, had rendered the muscular young Dodd of Oriel a per=
fect Daniel Lambert.=20

Little irreverent boys from the village corners were in the habit of shouti=
ng "Jumbo" at the poor=20

vicar. He was accustomed to pursue them, but in vain; a stern chase is prov=
erbially a long chase,=20

and poor Mr. Dodd's futile efforts to capture his persecutors had become a =
bye-word. But the=20

Reverend John Dodd's weak point, the red rag to the bull, the bee in his bo=
nnet, was his devotion=20

to the fair sex. Handsome Jack Dodd, as he had been once called, in his und=
ergraduate and=20

curate days, had been accustomed to find his attentions very highly appreci=
ated. The habit grew=20

on him, love-sick maidens sighed, and love-sick maidens wept, but all in va=
in. Handsome Jack=20

Dodd, a very clerical butterfly, flitted from flower to flower. His admirat=
ion was freely, openly,=20

ardently expressed for every variety of female beauty. Was Jack Dodd a flir=
t? Not a bit of it; he=20

was merely a fancier, just as there are pigeon fanciers and poultry fancier=
s; so Handsome Jack=20

Dodd was a fancier, an admirer, a worshipper of the entire female sex: that=
 is to say, the select=20

specimens of it. What he could have seen in Canon Drivel's daughter who can=
 say? though, when=20

he married Cecilia Drivel, she was a well-known light of London. She it was=
 who, in the severity of=20

her classic and rather imperial beauty, had posed to Mahlstick, R.A., for h=
is well-known picture of=20

Judith with the head of Holofernes. Alas! for poor Jack Dodd, he had assist=
ed at the numerous=20

sittings. He it was who had had the honour of sitting (that is to say lying=
 prone on a bedstead of=20

the period) for the headless trunk of Holofernes. To lie prone on a bedstea=
d of any period, and=20

have nothing to do for two mortal hours but gaze on the classic proportions=
 of any lady--for=20

Mahlstick was a strict disciplinarian and discouraged conversation--is enou=
gh to seal the fate of=20



any man, even if he were of a less inflammable type than Handsome Jack. Mis=
s Drivel was her=20

father's only daughter, and ambitious; but four seasons, during which she w=
as much admired, but=20

never once received a serious offer, had warned the waning beauty not to ne=
glect her=20

opportunities. Miss Drivel was a lady of no imagination and strong will; th=
e interest of her father, a=20

notorious pluralist, was very great: Cecilia Drivel was determined to marry=
 Dodd. She did so, and=20

her victim became her obedient slave, and was duly inducted to the fat livi=
ng of King's Warren. In=20

all things Jack Dodd, as the weaker vessel, yielded to his wife. He had but=
 one drawback in her=20

eyes, he retained his passion, his innocent passion, for the fair sex. At t=
he shrine of beauty he=20

remained a constant and ecstatic worshipper. This was Mrs. Dodd's cross, an=
d she had to bear it.=20

An idle life at King's Warren Parsonage, and frequent dinner parties, for t=
he Reverend John Dodd=20

was a popular man, had caused Handsome Jack to expand into a very Falstaff.=
 Alas, anxiety had=20

had precisely the reverse effect upon the vicar's wife. The once statuesque=
 "Judith" had=20

disappeared, and Mrs. Dodd's characteristics were now high principle and bo=
ne.  "Busy as usual,=20

my dear," said the vicar to his wife, as he proceeded to welcome each membe=
r of the female bevy=20

in turn, devoting perhaps a little more time than was necessary to handsome=
 Miss Warrender and=20

her cousin.  Mrs. Dodd closed the thick black book with a slap. "I suppose =
work is over now for the=20

day; you really should not intrude on our Dorcas, John," she said in a seve=
re tone.  "My dear, it is=20

my duty to encourage my parishioners in good works, nay, it is my pleasure,=
" replied the parson.=20

"No one doubts it, Mr. Dodd," said the vicaress in an icy manner.  But Mrs.=
 Dodd was evidently in=20

a minority. The ladies crowded round their popular vicar. It is easy to spo=
il a man, and the=20

Reverend John Dodd had been much spoilt by his parishioners, and seemed to =
like the process.=20

And now a whispered conference took place between the Misses Sleek. With sm=
iles and=20

conscious blushes, the elder sister addressed the vicar. "Oh, dear Mr. Dodd=
, we do so want you to=20

do us a favour," she faltered.  "Granted, my dear young lady, granted befor=
e it is asked."  Mrs.=20

Dodd vainly sought to fix her husband with a freezing look, and gazed appea=
lingly at old Mrs.=20

Wurzel, but that experienced matron had been present at many similar scenes=
, and was rather=20

amused than otherwise, to watch the discomfiture of the vicar's imperious w=
ife. Mrs. Wurzel's=20

eagle eye detected the little parcel which the younger Miss Sleek hesitatin=
gly attempted to hold=20

towards the vicar. "It is our own work, dear Mr. Dodd," she said, "and we h=
ope, we do hope, we do=20

_so_ hope that you will accept them."  "And wear them too," chimed in her s=
ister.  In an elaborate=20

box, from which Miss Sleek rapidly tore the paper in which it was wrapped, =
and hurriedly opened,=20

lay a dozen bands of the latest ecclesiastical fashion.  "Oh ladies, dear l=
adies, so you equip your=20

faithful knight for the fray; accept my grateful thanks, my very grateful t=
hanks," sighed the vicar.=20

"So pleased you like them, dear Mr. Dodd," chorused the stockbroker's daugh=
ters.  The triumphs=20

of decorative millinery were passed from hand to hand.  "They never made th=
ese," muttered old=20

Mrs. Wurzel to herself, as she critically held one up to the light. "The mi=
nxes," she inwardly added.=20

Mrs. Wurzel was quite right; they had been supplied, regardless of cost, fr=
om Messrs. Rochet and=20

Stole's well-known establishment.  "Ah," purred Lucy Warrender, "the ladies=
 used to arm their=20

knights with their own fair hands in the days of chivalry."  The parson lau=
ghed. "And have the days=20

of chivalry departed, ladies?" he said, protruding his head, much as the un=
conscious aldermanic=20

turtle is said to protrude his, when awaiting the fatal stroke.  Conny Slee=
k, the younger and bolder=20

of the two, looked at her sister; the elder girl nodded maliciously.  Conny=
 stepped smilingly=20



forward, and proceeded to affix the band around the vicar's massive throat.=
  Fat Jack Dodd was in=20

his glory; "Jumbo" was in the seventh heaven of bliss. A smile of beatitude=
 spread over his=20

enormous countenance during the process. But down inside the seam-stitch; d=
o not break off=20

every time you change colour, which must always take place at the seam-stit=
ch. Now do 3 plain=20

and 1 pearl alternately. When 5=C2=BD inches are done decrease on each side=
 of the seam-stitch. Do *=20

 decrease for the=20

ankle every five rows until you have 92 stitches. Knit until the stocking i=
s 20 inches long, and then=20

divide for the heel. Proceed as on page 10; pick up the side-stitches, and =
decrease over the instep=20

until you have 90 stitches: the front ribs must be carried on evenly, but t=

Measure an inch of each coloured knitting alternately: it is better to meas=
ure than to count the=20

rows, as silk is apt to be unequal. The ankle ought to be 100 stitches. Kni=
t a flap 3 inches long for=20

the heel, turn it, pick up the side-stitches, and decrease at the instep to=
 98. After the first joining of=20

the black and blue, pass the colour you are not using at the back; always c=
hange the colour at the=20

seam-stitch: in that way you need not break off the silk when you have fini=
shed a stripe, but keep=20

on with both balls, so as to join the silk only once. The remainder as page=

ing to have the first=20

stitch on the first needle as the seam-stitch. You make this, by working it=
 plain in 2 successive=20

rounds and pearling it in the next. Then do plain knitting for 5 inches. Yo=

follows:=E2=80=94Knit or pearl the seam-stitch, knit 3 and pearl 1. Continu=

crease on the right-hand=20

side of the seam-stitch by slipping a stitch, knit 1, pass the slipped stit=
ch over. Work the seam-

stitch and knit 2 together. If the stitch to be slipped happens to be a pea=
rl stitch, you must not slip=20

it but merely pearl two together on both sides. You will thus decrease 16 s=
titches, and now 16=C2=BD=20

inches ought to be done. Then knit 5 more inches. You ought now to have 94 =
stitches for the ankle=20

and divide for the heel. Proceed for this as on page 11; but as this is a l=
arge size, you must make=20

the flap 3=C2=BD long, always slipping the first stitch. When you have turn=
ed the heel you must take up=20

21 stitches, and decrease for the instep at first every row; and the last 6=
 decreasings do every=20

APTER IV.    WALLS=20

END CASTLE.   Walls End Castle was the seat of John, Earl of Pit Town. It h=
ad come into the=20

family through the marriage of a former earl with the heiress of the great =
Chudleigh family. It was=20

one of England's show places. The great park which surrounded it was one of=
 the most celebrated=20

in all England, celebrated alike for its size and its beauty. The entry to =
the park was never denied=20

to artists; and they, their easels, and their umbrellas, might be seen at t=
he various well-known=20

"bits" all through the summer and autumn. The boys of the Elizabethan Gramm=
ar School had also=20

the privilege of roaming in the park; and time had been when the people of =
the neighbouring town=20

and the public generally were admitted; but excursionists had arrived in cr=
owds, they had=20

destroyed the poetry of the place with pieces of greasy newspaper, broken b=
ottles, ham bones,=20

and the remains of their Homeric banquets. They had shouted and whistled in=
 the great picture=20

galleries, they had written their names upon the window panes, they had com=
mitted all the=20

innumerable offences that such people do commit; but the final straw which =
determined the=20

present earl to exclude them, was their having played at the game of Kiss-i=
n-the-ring, one Whit-

Monday, directly under the windows of the noble owner. After that memorable=
 day, Lord Pit Town=20

kept his castle and his park to himself.  His lordship during the earlier p=
art of his reign never came=20

near Walls End Castle. The widowed earl travelled continuously in Southern =
Europe. He travelled,=20

and he collected pictures, statuary, gems, plate, china--nothing came amiss=
 to him. But John, Earl=20

of Pit Town, was wise in his generation; he remembered that "if you sup wit=
h the devil, it is best to=20

use a long spoon." He never purchased without an expert's aid; consequently=
 the immense=20

collection he had gradually accumulated was free from rubbish. Nothing doub=
tful or "reputed" ever=20

arrived in the huge packing-cases consigned to Walls End Castle. For years =
his lordship was=20

seldom seen in London, the great house in Grosvenor Square was never opened=
. When Lord Pit=20

Town was in England, he stayed at Long's Hotel. Friends he had none; his do=
ctor and his courier=20

were the people who saw most of him. But as years rolled on his lordship gr=
ew tired of travel, his=20

well-known figure, in the short blue cloak and velvet collar, was seen no m=
ore in the great picture=20

galleries of Europe. Lord Pit Town now commenced the work of his life, the =
building of the new=20

galleries at Walls End Castle. Winter and summer the little old man, for he=
 was over sixty now,=20

might be seen in the blue cloak, inspecting the growth of the vast gallerie=
s with a critical eye.=20

Emilius Wolff, his German architect, was his constant companion. The great =
Mr. Buskin paid him a=20

yearly visit; on these occasions Dr. Wolff (for Wolff was a doctor of philo=
sophy) joined his lordship=20

and the great art-critic at dinner. At length the great Pit Town collection=
 was housed as it deserved=20

to be. Its principal feature was the picture gallery. This was a vast build=
ing of classical design,=20

resembling a Grecian temple. Dr. Wolff was a Berliner, and the tradition of=
 Berlin is that a picture=20

gallery should resemble a Greek temple. The vast galleries were probably am=
ong the best in=20

Europe. They were lighted and heated to perfection. But the great galleries=
 had one peculiarity; at=20

irregular intervals along the wall were blank spaces of varying size; in th=
e centre of each space=20

was a label in his lordship's own writing: on these labels were inscribed t=
he names of various great=20

painters. It was now the only business of the Earl of Pit Town to gradually=
 fill these spaces, each=20

with a representative masterpiece of the artist indicated. Possibly John, E=
arl of Pit Town,=20

notwithstanding his boundless wealth, could hardly hope to complete such a =
work in his own=20



lifetime. The great Mr. Abrahams had an unlimited commission to secure at a=
ny price, a long list of=20

great works. There was but one condition attached, any purchase must be abo=
ve suspicion. But=20

even the great Mr. Abrahams, on one notable occasion at least, had been dec=
eived. A new=20

acquisition, purchased from the collection of a wealthy amateur in the Rue =
Drouot, had arrived at=20

Walls End Castle. A furious controversy concerning this picture had arisen =
among art critics. Herr=20

Vandenbossche had defended the authenticity of the work, but old Mr. Creeps=
 had demolished=20

him in an exhaustive article in the _Friday Review_. Old Mr. Creeps was con=
siderably astonished=20

at receiving an almost affectionate letter from Lord Pit Town. His lordship=
 thanked him for the=20

article, and requested what he termed "the exceeding great pleasure of rece=
iving you here;" the=20

letter was dated from Walls End Castle. Old Mr. Creeps accepted the invitat=
ion for a couple of=20

days. On his arrival at the local railway station he was met by his lordshi=
p in person. Lord Pit=20

Town, one of the proudest and most exclusive of men, treated old Mr. Creeps=
 with marked=20

deference. At dinner, at which John Buskin and Dr. Wolff were present, conv=
ersation ran purely=20

upon art matters. Old Mr. Creeps, the critic, had never enjoyed himself so =
much; the sitting was=20

prolonged till the small hours. Next day, at noon, the council of four sat =
in solemn conclave upon=20

Lord Pit Town's latest purchase. Old Mr. Creeps triumphantly proved his cas=
e. Lord Pit Town=20

looked at Mr. Buskin. Mr. Buskin nodded. "Well, Wolff?" remarked his lordsh=
ip.  "It is onhappy,=20

most onhappy," replied the doctor of philosophy, "but I fear it is drue, to=
o drue."  "What will your=20

lordship do with it?" said old Mr. Creeps.  "You shall see," replied that e=
minent collector with a=20

smile, as he advanced to the easel on which the doubtful picture stood. His=
 lordship opened his=20

penknife, carefully and quietly he cut the canvas out of the frame, he fold=
ed it in half; again he cut=20

it, as though he were cutting up a sheet of brown paper; he repeated the pr=
ocess several times,=20

then, handing the pieces to the German, he merely remarked, "Oblige me by b=
urning these,=20

Wolff."  "They shall make a vamous blaze," said the philosopher, as he left=
 the room to carry out=20

the sentence.  "Would that all collectors could afford to do the same, Lord=
 Pit Town," remarked=20

John Buskin with a sigh.  "Your lordship has done a noble act," cheerfully =
cried old Mr. Creeps, as=20

he rubbed his hands. "Of course you will trounce Abrahams. When the artisti=
c world hears of this=20

morning's work, Lord Pit Town, it will know what it owes to England's most =
distinguished amateur."=20

"No, no, Mr. Creeps. I must ask you to keep this business a secret; no chea=
p popularity for me,"=20

replied the old lord.  "Cheap!" echoed the critic, as he raised his eyes to=
 the skylight. "Good=20

heavens! he calls it cheap," whispered the old man to John Buskin.  "His lo=
rdship is right," was the=20

oracle's oracular reply.  Men said that Lord Pit Town was eccentric. Gossip=
s said that he was mad.=20

Perhaps after all he was only honest according to his lights. Next day the =
handsome frame,=20

carefully packed, was returned to Mr. Abrahams; it was duly deducted from h=
is account. But he got=20

his cheque for the price of the picture, and his very liberal commission.  =
In vain did the artists who=20

frequented Walls End Park attempt to stalk the old nobleman in his lonely w=
alks. They never=20

succeeded in selling him a picture from the easel. "Capital, capital," his =
lordship would remark with=20

great alacrity, when there was no other way of escape. The eldest Miss Solo=
monson, the most=20

talented member of that clever Hebrew family--she is great at animals--trie=
d to shoot the wary old=20

lord with her well-known picture of "The Timid Fawn," but she ignominiously=
 failed.  "The old=20

wretch called me 'my dear,' and said he liked my sky, when I hadn't even in=
dicated the sky," she=20

indignantly remarked to her amused father.  Miss Solomonson's masses of jet=
ty hair, and the fire=20



from the glances of her oriental eyes, were said to have melted the stony h=
earts even of dealers=20

who were her co-religionists. But with all her advantages Miss Solomonson f=
ailed with the old lord,=20

and she abuses him to this day. She had her revenge, however, for in her we=
ll-known Academy=20

picture of the following year, "Balaam and his Ass," the angel was represen=
ted by a glorified=20

portrait of Miss Solomonson herself, who glared down in an indignant manner=
 upon the terrified=20

and kneeling Balaam. Old Mr. Creeps and the other art-critics chuckled as t=
hey recognized the=20

angelic portrait; but they chuckled still more, when they saw that the terr=
ified Balaam was but an=20

ill-natured caricature of John, Earl of Pit Town.  "I'd have done him as th=
e ass, you know, only he=20

was too ugly. I hope he'll like the figures better than the sky this time,"=
 snorted the indignant=20

Hebrew maiden.  The curse of the Earl of Pit Town's life was the so-called =
gallery of old masters in=20

Walls End Castle. He couldn't sell them; he couldn't burn them; he was even=
 compelled to insure=20

them, to his intense disgust. For when a former lord had inherited Walls En=
d Castle from the=20

Chudleighs, old masters had been the fashion; and the purchaser, delighted =
with his toy, had=20

made the pictures heirlooms. But the present lord had shut up what to him w=
as a mere chamber of=20

horrors. He and Dr. Wolff had actually composed a catalogue _raisonne_ of t=
he entire collection,=20

in which the fictitious nature of the claims to respect of each monstrous d=
aub was triumphantly=20

demonstrated. The sprawling Rubenses were shown to be but inferior copies, =
the Paul Veronese=20

was proved a transparent sham, while the great Vandyck, representing the Ma=
rtyr-King seated on=20

a gigantic grey horse, was demonstrated to be but a wretched replica of a m=
iserable original.=20

There they hung, the old Pit Town heirlooms, grimy with dirt; for as the ol=
d lord used to say, "To=20

have cleaned them would have been only to make their natural hideousness st=
ill more apparent."=20

Each picture bore a label, giving a true description of the once-honoured g=
em. Alas! these=20

veracious tablets cruelly contrasted with the flourishes of the old houseke=
eper's descriptions.  Two=20

only of his heirlooms had stood the crucial inspections of Lord Pit Town an=
d his experts. These=20

were the great Raphael, and the celebrated portrait of Barbara Chudleigh, t=
he well-known beauty=20

of Charles the Second's time, by Sir Peter Lely. Wicked Bab Chudleigh, as a=
 wood nymph,=20

simpered upon the walls of the new gallery in which the Chudleigh Raphael o=
ccupied the post of=20

honour.  We have seen what manner of man John, Earl of Pit Town, was. We ha=
ve seen how his=20

heirlooms troubled him not a little. We have seen how he passed his life wi=
th the faithful Wolff at=20

Walls End Castle, patiently waiting to fill the numerous blanks on the wall=
s of the new galleries, in=20

fact to accomplish his destiny. For if ever there was a born collector, a r=
eal collector, to whom the=20

actual intrinsic value of a painting was absolutely of no importance, it wa=
s John, Earl of Pit Town.=20

And this indifference to the value at the hammer of their acquisitions, mar=
ks the distinction=20

between the genuine collector or connoisseur and the ruck of the people who=
 buy pictures; the=20

bulk of whom are after all but amateur dealers. When the successful stock-j=
obber leaves off=20

dealing in shares and takes to art, he merely deals in another more or less=
 intangible security of=20

very fluctuating value. With childlike confidence he follows the advice of =
some more or less honest=20

dealer. He buys from the easel with a hope of a "rapid rise." Works are kno=
cked down to him at=20

Christie's simply because they are apparently cheap, and he is carrying out=
 the old axiom of his=20

trade, "always buy rubbish." In the same way he is perpetually buying and s=
elling pictures upon=20

the time honoured maxim of Capel Court, "nail your profit, and cut your los=
s." He will even go so=20

far as to develop a taste for a particular master in the hope that he may s=
ucceed ultimately in=20



making a "corner" in that special security. And the sole dream of such a ma=
n is the result in=20

pounds, shillings and pence of the auction that will inevitably take place =
at his death. The=20

possession of a certain number of valuable works of art confers an amount o=
f distinction upon their=20

proprietor, and Brown, who as Brown is a nobody, becomes a somebody as the =
owner of the=20

Brown collection. Of this fact Manchester "men" and Liverpool "gentlemen" a=
re well aware. But, as=20

has been seen, a deep gulf divided these amateur dealers from John, Earl of=
 Pit Town.  The old=20

earl's property, the source of his wealth, as from his title the reader wil=
l have shrewdly guessed,=20

was in collieries. With the management of these, however, the Earl of Pit T=
own did not trouble=20

himself. His various agents paid yearly increasing sums into that aristocra=
tic bank in the Strand,=20

which never allows interest on deposits, which never advises any investment=
 except Consols, and=20

whose clerks from time immemorial have worn white chokers.  For many years =
it had been the old=20

lord's habit to entertain those members of his family, never exceeding four=
 in number, who were=20

nearest to the title. Twice a year the formal invitation was sent out by th=
e old nobleman to his only=20

son, and to his two nephews. Once in the height of the summer and once at C=
hristmas these=20

invitations were issued. They were never refused, for their recipients look=
ed upon them much in=20

the light of a royal command.  Lord Hetton, the earl's only son, and his he=
ir, was always one of the=20

guests on these occasions; to him it was an exceedingly unpleasant time; fo=
r father and son had=20

quarrelled years ago, the old lord having sternly declined to increase his =
son's very liberal=20

allowance of five thousand a year. A man can do a great deal on five thousa=
nd a year, but not=20

much is left for the annuitant when he is possessed by the idea that, some =
day or other, it will be=20

his good fortune to win the Derby. In all other things but race-horses, Het=
ton was a man of frugal=20

mind. For the sake of his stud he had remained a bachelor; for he felt that=
 were he to marry, yet=20

another obstacle would be raised to the attainment of his ambition. Ever si=
nce his majority Lord=20

Hetton had annually entered a colt in the great race. His nominations had o=
n two occasions even=20

run into places. Four years ago Hetton's horse had been first favourite, bu=
t it was ignominiously=20

beaten. This very year, that rank outsider, Dark Despair, who, starting at =
sixty to one, had just=20

been beaten on the post, was the property of his persevering, but unlucky, =
lordship. Twice a year=20

did Lord Hetton present himself at Walls End Castle. He used to walk throug=
h the park, and note=20

with pleasure the care that his father bestowed on the gigantic property. I=
t pleased him to see how=20

well kept was everything about the place. It gratified him to find his opin=
ions deferentially listened=20

to by the steward, and to perceive that year by year the family solicitors =
treated him with a still=20

greater obsequiousness. But in his heart, he cursed what he called his fath=
er's folly, as he looked=20

at the new galleries; and he would have liked to stamp and swear, as at eve=
ry visit he dutifully=20

admired each new and costly acquisition of the old earl's. He would walk di=
scontentedly up and=20

down the old picture gallery where hung the worthless heirlooms that, in th=
e ordinary course of=20

nature, must one day be his own: and he wondered whether he should ever pos=
sess the Golconda=20

contained in the new galleries. Perhaps it was only human nature that cause=
d him to watch, and=20

watch in vain, for any apparent sign of increasing infirmity in the old ear=
l. But he never quarrelled=20

with his father, for on the morning of his departure from the paternal roof=
, he was accustomed to=20

receive a very considerable _solatium_ to his wounded feelings, in the shap=
e of a heavy cheque=20

on the bank in the Strand. The amount of this cheque was invariable; it kep=
t Hetton on his good=20

behaviour, and he had learned to look upon it as part of his allowance. On =
one memorable=20



occasion he had presumed to remonstrate with his father on the enormous cos=
t of his last artistic=20

acquisitions; the earl had merely shrugged his shoulders. That visit had be=
en indignantly=20

remembered by Lord Hetton, for when the venerable connoisseur bade his lord=
ship good-bye,=20

there had been no cheque, though there was no change in his lordship's mann=
er towards his son.=20

Mr. Haggard, of the Home Office, a faultlessly-dressed gentleman, whose pri=
ncipal characteristic=20

was his brilliant whist, which it was said brought him in a certain but var=
iable income, was the next=20

heir in direct succession; he was the nephew of his lordship, and a childle=
ss bachelor. His=20

presence, also, always graced Walls End Castle at the regulation periods.  =
Mr. John Haggard, of=20

Ash Priory, the father of big Reginald, was always the third guest. John Ha=
ggard, the second=20

nephew of Lord Pit Town, was a J.P. for his county, of the Shakespearian ty=
pe. He was fond of=20

good living, his eye was severe, and his beard of sober cut. He embodied th=
e law, in his own=20

immediate neighbourhood, to the intense terror of local delinquents. He had=
 meted out stern=20

justice to his own son, when he had banished big Reginald to South America;=
 but he had his=20

virtues. He lived within his means, he entertained his neighbours at rather=
 heavy dinners, he gave=20

his wife and daughters a fortnight in town during the season, and he habitu=
ally took the first prize=20

at the county show for black pigs. He never forgot that he was third in suc=
cession to the title. He=20

never doubted his capacity, should he ever be called to occupy the position=
 of a hereditary=20

legislator; and now that his son had returned a considerably wealthier man =
than he himself was,=20

he chuckled, when in his mind's eye he thought of him as some day bearing t=
he courtesy title of=20

Lord Hetton.  The earl and the doctor of philosophy sat at breakfast in a l=
ittle oak wainscoted room=20

whose windows commanded a full view of the new galleries. In this little ro=
om the galleries had=20

been designed; the windows had looked upon the commencement of the great wo=
rk. An army of=20

navvies had dug out the earth for the gigantic foundations. Then arose a ve=
ry forest of scaffold-

poles. Two huge steam engines had snorted and puffed for three whole years.=
 A colossal steam=20

"traveller" had ceaselessly carried great blocks of stone and long steel gi=
rders from point to point.=20

The clink of the stone-masons' chisels had resounded year after year from m=
orning till night. Then=20

came the carpenters, and the noise of their busy hammers had been deafening=
. When not actually=20

on the works, Lord Pit Town had viewed them from the window of his favourit=
e room. But scaffold=20

poles, steam engines and labourers had disappeared; the rubbish had been cl=
eared away, and the=20

huge white block stood out in the clear air; dominating the grey weather-st=
ained gables of Walls=20

End Castle much as Aladdin's palace is said to have dominated the more anci=
ent but less=20

magnificent residence of his father-in-law the Emperor of China. There was =
an air of spick-and-

spanness about the whole thing that annoyed working them. Pearl a row, and =
knit a row.  Then,=20

slip the 1st stitch,* take 2 together; repeat from *.  The next row slip 1,=
 and increase before every=20

 at the side of flap _d_, still=20

knitting with pink wool, and take up the 14 stitches at _e_.  Knit 14 rows =
in pink. Go back to * at the=20

one for the trouble taken.     _Baby=E2=80=99s Boot._  (A VERY EASY PATTERN=

No. 13.  Cast on 30; and, if speed be a desirability, the entire sock may b=
e done in plain knitting,=20

but the following way is far prettier. Knit the 1st row; then do 24 rows fo=
r the leg, in any fancy stitch=20

you like; the last row,* knit 2, wool over the needle, take 2 together. Rep=
eat from *. This forms=20

holes, into which ribbon must afterwards be run.  Twenty-fifth row.=E2=80=
=94From this time forward you=20

must knit 1, pearl 1; reversed every third row, to make a kind of dice patt=
ern. Cast on 11 extra=20

stitches at the end of each of the next two rows, making 52 in all. Increas=
e at the beginning of=20

every row until there are 62 stitches; do 4 plain rows; then decrease in th=
e same way until you=20

have only 52 again. Cast off and sew up. Crochet a double scallop at the to=
p in blue Andalusian,=20

to give a little finish.     _Double Knitting._   Cast on any number of sti=

Second row=E2=80=94slip the 1st stitch, knit the 2nd in the usual manner, _=
but_ put the thread twice round=20

the needle. Then bring the thread forward as if you were going to pearl, on=
ly _do not_ pearl, but=20

take the stitch off, and put the wool in front of the stitch back to its pl=
ace. Then begin again and=20

knit a stitch with wool twice round the needle.  Third row=E2=80=94knit the=
 first stitch. Bring the wool=20

forward, and take off the long stitch, putting the thread down in front. Kn=
it the short stitch, putting=20

the thread twice round the needle.     _Double Knitting with Four Pins._   =
Cast on twice the number=20

of stitches you wish to have on the right side of the knitting.  * Bring th=

round=E2=80=94pearl, putting the thread twice round the needle, put the woo=
l back to the other side, and=20

then slip the long stitch. Repeat these two stitches.  You must be very car=
eful in changing these=20

rows, as otherwise it joins. A good plan is to tie a piece of red wool wher=
e the pattern begins. Of=20

course the pattern interlaces at the 1st stitch, but otherwise it ought to =
be quite separate.  Third=20

round=E2=80=94the same as 1st.  Fourth row=E2=80=94the same as 2nd.     _Co=

=80=941 plain, 1 pearl. Repeat.=20

You must be careful always to pearl where, in the preceding row, you worked=
 a plain stitch. Every=20

row is alike. When you have knitted it long enough, work another side in th=
e same manner, and=20

send it to a tailor to make up. This knitting will not run down when cut.  =
   _Another._  (LARGER=20

OR SMALLER SIZE.)   As sizes vary so much, a good plan to ensure a nice fit=
 is to measure the=20

front of a waistcoat at the broadest part, and then for every inch allow 6 =
stitches in double Berlin=20

wool, with steel pins No. 10.  Thus: suppose your waistcoat ought to measur=
e 11 inches across,=20

you must cast on 66 stitches; and for the turnings in you had better allow =
9 stitches: altogether, 75=20

stitches.     _Ermine Muffatee._   1 oz. white and 1 oz. scarlet, 1 skein b=
lack, 1 skein yellow Berlin=20

wool; 4 pins, No. 17.  Cast on 20 on 2 needles, and 23 on the 3rd. Knit 2 i=

pearl. Join the scarlet, knit 1 plain inch. Go on with the white and knit 2=
 inches, ribbed, 3 and 3.=20

Take a wool-needle, and with black wool make 2 little lengthway stitches on=
 the plain stitches of=20

the ribbed part. Then make a yellow stitch between the black, to imitate er=
mine spots. Now double=20

back the plain knitting and hem it in a neat fold. Any other colour may be =
substituted for scarlet. A=20

Repeat for about an inch. Then 4=C2=BD inches of plain knitting. Another in=
ch to match the bottom part,=20

of 2 plain and 2 pearl alternately; remembering, of course, to make the pla=
in stitches in one row,=20

the pearled ones in the next. Cast off, and take care not to cast off too t=
ightly, as this part goes=20

over the hand. Sew up, leaving about four inches unsewn for the thumb. Join=
 the wool at the lower=20

part of the thumb, nearest the wrist; pick up 2 stitches; with your second =
needle turn and pearl off=20

these 2 together. Now you have 1 stitch upon your needle; knit this stitch =
and pick up 1 from the=20

side; turn and pearl these two; pick up another from the other side. Contin=
ue to pick up these side-

stitches, but every 3 rows you must knit (or pearl) 2 together until you ha=
ve decreased 8 stitches.=20

You will now find it more convenient to have the knitting on 2 pins. Contin=
ue knitting and pearling=20

until you have picked up nearly all the side-stitches. These few remaining =
stitches, about 8 (4 on=20

either side), take up on a third needle, and knit 3 plain rounds.  Fourth r=

Needles, No. 9; merino wool, or 2-ply fleecy; the former for summer wear.  =
These cost about 1s.=20

1d. each, and are the greatest comfort to those who suffer from the cold.  =
The 2-ply fleecy is the=20

best wool to use, as it does not wash hard.  For the back=E2=80=94cast on 7=
8 stitches, pearl 3, plain 3, in=20

ribs for 140 rows.  141st row=E2=80=94knit 18 stitches; now turn (these 18 =
stitches form the shoulder-

strap); pearl the 18; knit them; turn, and pearl them. You ought now to be =
beginning the row again,=20

and this time you pearl; and now pearl the 17th and 18th stitches together;=
 turn and knit back; knit=20

a row, taking the 16th and 17th together; turn and pearl back; knit a row, =
taking the 15th and 16th=20

together. Turn, and knit the row. Go on in this way, remembering always to =
decrease at the left=20

side, at the end of every row, until you have done 5 ribs altogether. You o=
ught to have 12 stitches=20

on now. Then cast off. These ribs ought to be crossways instead of lengthwa=
ys.  Now begin to=20

cast off the remaining stitches, until you come to the last 18. Work this s=
houlder the same as the=20

last.  [Illustration]  The _Fig._ is the right-hand shoulder, the plain and=
 pearl each counting as one=20

rib, making 5 in all.  For the front part of the vest you cast on 78 stitch=
es and knit 125 rows. Begin=20

the right-hand shoulder by pearling, and make ribs as before, only this tim=
e you do not begin to=20

decrease at the left until you have done 7 ribs. Reduce to 12 stitches; mak=
e 11 ribs and cast off.=20

Cast off the remaining stitches, and proceed as before with the last 18 for=
 the fourth shoulder-

piece.  Now sew up these two sides until you get to within 24 rows from the=
 top of the front piece,=20

which is the shortest. You must now join the rest with a gusset, which you =
form by picking up one=20

stitch, knit it and turn; in every row you must now take up one stitch, and=
 rib them the same as the=20

other part of the vest in 3 and 3. Thus, the first row you have 1 stitch, t=
he next row 2, the next row=20

3, and so on. When 24 rows are done, cast off. Sew up the shoulders, and cr=
ochet a narrow=20

border of small even holes, into which run a piece of crochet wool or white=
 ribbon.  It is a good=20

plan to pick up the stitches all along the shoulder-strap, and knit a few r=
ows, according to the=20

depth of sleeve desired.     _Shetland Shawl._   This takes =C2=BE lb. of w=
ool, and costs about 9s. A=20

scarlet or violet crocheted border improves it. It can be finished off with=
 a fringe or not, as suits the=20

taste. Bone pins, No. 7.  Cast on 302. Knit a plain row; knit 1 plain stitc=

two. Repeat from *. The=20

pearl, except the spout, which leave plain, decreasing 1 stitch at each sid=
e of the twelve in the first=20

4 rounds, and 1 stitch on every alternate side in the next 8 rounds. The sp=
out is now finished, and=20

you ought to have 31 stitches on the needles.  Knit 12 rounds, 2 pearl, 2 p=
lain, except under the=20

spout, where 1 stitch is to be plain.  With black begin the bowl; increase =
by knitting 2 in 1; pearl 2=20

round black, decreasing 10 stitches at intervals. Pearl 2 rounds black. Kni=
t 4 rounds pink, 1 round=20

black, decreasing 6. Pearl 2 black rounds. You ought now to have 72 stitche=
s. Divide these by 6.=20



Knit 11 rounds pink, decreasing 6 stitches in each round by knitting 2 toge=
ther at the=20

commencement of each division, where a star of 6 points will be found, and =
6 stitches will remain=20

on the needles. These are to be drawn up and sewn together. Now cast on 6 s=
titches in black, and=20

knit and pearl alternately until you have done 3 inches: this is for the ha=
ndle; attach one end to the=20

bowl and the other to the top of the jug.     _Another._  (LONG SHAPE.)   A=
ndalusian wool as the=20

preceding pattern, and pins No. 15.  Cast on 12 stitches for the spout, and=
 15 on two other pins.=20

Knit 4 rounds. Now decrease each side of the spout in every round. Do 9 rou=
nds and then 3 pearl=20

rows; then 9 more plain rows. Now for the bowl=E2=80=94increase 1 stitch in=
 every five, and then do three=20

rounds in black; now join the pink and * knit 2 together, make 1, knit 1: r=

in every 8. Then with=20

stead of increasing.=20

Repeat as in preceding pattern and sew up. Take up 6 stitches at the top of=
 the jug opposite the=20

_Easy and Handsome Pattern for an Antimacassar, or Couvrette._   In 6-threa=
d fleecy wool, =C2=BC lb.=20

for each stripe. Pins, No. 6. This costs 9s. 9d. Scarlet maize, black, gree=
n, violet, are pretty=20

contrasts.  Cast on 14 stitches plain knitting until you have attained the =
required length. The only=20

difficulty is in the casting off. You begin by slipping the first stitch an=
d knitting the second, which=20

must be very loose indeed, almost an inch in length; pass the slipped stitc=
h over. Now drop the 3rd=20

stitch and let it run the whole length of the knitting. Continue thus. The =
dropped stitches are=20

allowed to run down, and they form a kind of loop-pattern separated by ridg=
es. Add a fringe at top=20

and bottom.     _Another._   4-ply fleecy, and bone pins to match.  Cast on=
 19 and rib cross-ways=20

in nines. When long enough drop the middle stitch. Cast on 9 in white, rib =
another stripe in the=20

same way, and drop the middle stitch. Crochet with black along every colour=
ed stripe, and join to=20

the white with maize or orange. Two stripes of green and one of purple look=
 very nice.     _Persian=20

f these couvrettes is=20

generally about the same.  2 or 3 skeins of 4-thread fleecy, of each colour=
, according to the length=20

required. Pins, No. 10. Scarlet, gold, green, violet, dark crimson, and blu=

white filoselle, at 3d. per skein, from Adams and Co., 5 New Street, Bishop=

rk pattern=E2=80=94a palm is=20



best=E2=80=94or any Moorish pattern, and work it in cross-stitch on the kni=
tting. Do 5 on one strip and 6 on=20

the next, so that they do not come exactly in a line one with another. This=
 has a very handsome=20

effect, indeed. The pattern ought to be worked in black, or black and white=
 filoselle. Join, and add=20

a fringe.     _Raised Plait Knitting for Carriage-rug._  (THIS IS EXTREMELY=
 HANDSOME.)   Pins,=20

_
whole years, but they still looked painfully fresh.  "I hear that I am to h=
ave the pleasure of=20

welcoming another of your lordship's relatives this year," said the doctor =
of philosophy to the earl.=20

"Yes; Wolff 'where the carcase is there shall the eagles be gathered togeth=
er.' I have kept them=20

waiting for some years, and I don't feel a bit like dying, Wolff. Though I =
confess I dread Hetton's=20

critical examination. He always looks me over in his stud-groom sort of way=
. But I suppose, as he=20

is my nearest relative, it is but natural he should be anxious about my hea=
lth. As for the young=20

fellow, I have never even seen him. My nephew wished to bring him, and he i=
s about to marry. In=20

fact he and his father will be the only married men among my direct heirs."=
  "And does the young=20

man love art?"  "No. I think his talents are confined to spending money and=
 getting into trouble.=20

But my nephew tells me that he is now going to forswear sack and live clean=
ly."  "That is what I=20

cannot understand, my lord. I had a cold the other day, a most severe cold.=
 I tell the young man to=20

bring me a cup of sack; he sends to me the butler. I say to him, 'Give me t=
he sack.' He replied to=20

me, 'I cannot do that, sir, it's only his lordship can do that.' What is, t=
hen, this precious drink I read=20

of in my Shakespeare--so precious, that your lordship will not trust him to=
 his butler? And now you=20

tell me that your nephew will drink him no more. I never see your lordship =
drink him. Has, then,=20

your lordship forsworn him too?"  His lordship laughed as he finished his c=
offee. "No one drinks=20

sack now-a-days, Wolff, and the quotation was merely figurative; while the =
other sack the butler=20

talked about was but a vulgarism used by his class. You will never get that=
 either, in my lifetime at=20

least."  "I understand it not. But your grand-nephew, the young man, it ple=
ases you that he shall=20

marry?"  "It is indifferent to me, Wolff; if I can only live to fill the va=
cant wall spaces in the new=20

galleries, I can seriously say, _apres moi le deluge_. But here comes the f=
irst arrival."  One of his=20

lordship's close carriages was coming up the great chestnut avenue; Lord He=
tton was its sole=20

occupant. As the old butler received him in the hall, with the deference du=
e to his master's son, the=20

sporting nobleman laughingly commiserated him.  "We have neither of us any =
luck, Russell, as=20

usual," he said. "I thought I had a real good thing this time. As usual, I =
put you on for a fiver,=20

Russell; as usual, it didn't come off." Lord Hetton was of a frugal mind. H=
e was continually=20

presenting innumerable imaginary fivers to little people. He was always put=
ting them on for them=20

at tremendous odds, but the good things never came off, and the recipients =
of his favours were=20

never informed of his munificence _till after the event_.  "I most humbly t=
hank your lordship,"=20

replied the butler with an air of profound gratitude, as he chuckled in his=
 sleeve. For the old man=20

too was of a sporting turn. He knew all about Dark Despair, and annually he=
 had carefully laid the=20

odds against Lord Hetton's nomination for the great race.  "The same rooms,=
 I suppose, Russell?"=20

"Always the same rooms, your lordship."  Lord Hetton mechanically proceeded=
 to his quarters.  On=20

joining the earl, father and son met as if they had parted only the previou=
s day. The pursuits of=20

neither interested the other. Art and horse-flesh were subjects tabooed by =
mutual consent. A=20

desultory conversation on politics, in which neither took the slightest int=
erest, was a safe neutral=20

ground. It was with a feeling of relief on both sides that the arrival of M=
r. Haggard, of the Home=20

Office, was announced. His lordship retired shortly to his study, Hetton an=
d Mr. Haggard betook=20

themselves to the billiard-room.  At dinner the family party was increased =
by the presence of John=20

Haggard and his son, both of whom were well received by the earl, who now s=
aw his grand-

nephew for the first time. Big Reginald's magnificent physique made its due=
 impression; his father=20

was evidently proud of him, and the old lord congratulated the young man on=
 his approaching=20



marriage.  Reginald Haggard was not diffident, he truckled to no one. He fr=
ankly avowed to his=20

grand uncle that he knew nothing of art. When his lordship retired early, a=
s was his custom, the=20

other men adjourned once more to the billiard-room. Big Reginald took their=
 lives at pool, and=20

pocketed their half-crowns in an easy genial way, which almost made losing =
a pleasure.  During=20

the fortnight in which Lord Pit Town entertained his relatives, nothing occ=
urred to mar the harmony=20

of the meeting. During that fortnight Big Reginald got on friendly terms wi=
th everybody.  Nothing=20

seemed to overawe or intimidate the ingenuous youth. He saw with evident pl=
easure the outward=20

and visible signs of the old earl's immense wealth. As he looked round upon=
 the priceless=20

collection in the new galleries, as he thought of the old nobleman's huge e=
states, he remembered=20

that the investment that Mr. Hyam Hyams had made in his own contingent post=
 obits was probably=20

a good one; he prudently determined to pay off the Jew as soon as he should=
 realize his American=20

properties. In his own mind he determined already that, should he ever be h=
is great-uncle's=20

successor, he would distribute the great Pit Town collection to the four wi=
nds of heaven. But he=20

made one mental reservation, as he stood before Sir Peter Lely's masterpiec=
e, and gazed on the=20

lovely features and roving eye of "Wicked Bab Chudleigh:" "A monstrous fine=
 girl. Yes, I should=20

stick to her." If Reginald Haggard did come into the estates after all, and=
 did "stick to her," she=20

would be the first one of her sex he had ever stuck to.  Walls End Castle, =
when the party broke up,=20

returned to its normal state. The earl and the philosopher continued the ev=
en tenour of their ways.=20

Lord Hetton took away his big cheque, which was duly honoured at the old-fa=
shioned bank in the=20

Strand. A cheque for a like amount had been given to Reginald Haggard by th=
e earl. "Buy=20

something for your wife that-is-to-be," he said to his grand-nephew, as he =
handed him the folded=20

paper. "Warrender was one of my friends years ago, when I had friends," sai=
d the old nobleman=20

with a sigh "They are good old-fashioned people the Warrenders, and honest.=
 Don't thank me," he=20

said, as he shook hands with the young fellow. "Of course you will come her=
e with your father in=20

the winter. I shall hope to see the new Mrs. Haggard too," he added. "Good-=
bye. I shall send you a=20

formal invitation."  When big Reginald told his father of this interview, a=
s they were driving to the=20

station, Justice Haggard did not conceal his satisfaction. "He will outlive=
 all of _us_, my boy,=20

Hetton into the bargain. Who knows but _you_ may be one day Earl of Pit Tow=
n? Keep in with the=20

old man if you can. His place, as you have seen, is perfect, all but the pi=
ggeries. He doesn't go in=20

for pigs though, he goes in for pictures--every man to his taste. I prefer =
pigs."       CHAPTER V.=20

AT THE PANDEMONIUM CLUB.   It was Wednesday night; over forty men sat down =
to the house-

dinner at the Pandemonium Club. As usual the dinner was _recherche_, for th=
e Pandemonium=20

_chef_ enjoyed a world-wide reputation. It is to be feared that the attract=
ions of the house-dinner=20

were not the sole inducement to many of those sitting there. A house-dinner=
 always secured a=20

large party in the card-room afterwards, and though the Pandemonium was a c=
elebrated dining=20

club, it was notoriously also a gambling one. Though the Pandemonium was a =
gambler's paradise,=20

and many scandals had occurred there, yet the dirty linen had been always w=
ashed the crochet-

needle in a stitch of the couvre-pied and pull the ends of the wool through=
 the loop, and tighten=20

gently with the fingers.     _Baby=E2=80=99s Berceaunette Cover._   Long wo=
oden pins, No. 10. 1 lb. pink=20

and 1 lb. white, 4-thread fleecy. Costs 15s. with lining.  Cast on 7 stitch=
es with pink, 7 with white;=20

continue to cast on alternately 7 in each colour until you have 147 altoget=
her. Do * 7 stitches in=20

pink, 7 in white. Repeat 3rd row, 7 pink stitches, and pass the wool in fro=
nt; then go on with the=20



white. Continue this knitting, and when 7 rows are done do white over the p=
ink squares and pink=20

over the white; you thus make regular rows of squares. You must be careful =
always to pass the=20

wool after every alternate row to the front of the knitting, so as to have =
all the long threads on the=20

wrong side: care must be taken not to pull these threads too tightly in pas=
sing from one coloured=20

square to another. Make a fringe, and line carefully with pink silk.  Sever=
al of the couvrette=20

patterns would make the above, and nearly all the fancy stitches would be p=
retty done in stripes of=20

pink and white.     _Knitted Quilt._   In stripes with cross-stitch sprigs.=
  Bone pins No. 6, and 4 lb.=20

6-thread fleecy, scarlet and white.  Cast on 12 stitches; knit a stripe of =
plain knitting, 208 rows=20

long. Now work about 17 sprigs or any other pattern on it, in bright filose=
lle silk (see page 10),=20

leaving 10 rows between each pattern. Now knit a scarlet stripe 108 rows lo=
ng. This stripe has no=20

sprigs worked on it. Do 10 scarlet and 9 white stripes, and join together. =
    _Hearth-Rug._   This=20

must be made in squares and then sewn together. Cast on with ordinary twine=
 and steel pins any=20

even number of stitches. Have ready narrow pieces of cloth, about 2=C2=BE i=
nches long and =C2=BD inch=20

broad. Knit one plain row. Second row, slip one; * put a strip of cloth bet=
ween the two needles and=20

knit a stitch; then turn the end of cloth up again so that both ends may co=
me on the right side. Knit=20

a stitch. Repeat from *. The next row plain. You must pull this knitting ra=
ther tight.  The cloth can=20

be bought of almost any tailor by the pound of scraps. It makes a pretty bo=
rder to put scarlet=20

stripes at regular intervals.     _Loop Knitting._   This knitting leaves l=
oops on one side, and is very=20

pretty and warm for quilts, couvrettes, &c.  Cast on, in 6-thread fleecy an=
d pins No. 7, any number=20

of stitches. Do not slip the first stitch, but always knit it.  First row=
=E2=80=94plain knitting.  Second row=E2=80=94put=20

the wool round the needle as if you were going to knit a plain stitch, but =
instead of knitting let the=20

wool hang straight down over the forefinger of the left hand; wind it round=
 and put it for the second=20

time over the right needle. Wind the wool a second time round the finger, a=
nd for the third time put=20

it round the needle; and now knit this stitch, which ought to have the appe=
arance of three in one.=20

Repeat. The next row plain. Do about six rows plain and then repeat with th=
e loops; of course you=20

must only make them on one side of the knitting, and they will require a li=
ttle pulling to keep them=20

in the right place. This is handsome in stripes of shaded red.     _Fringe.=
_   Berlin wool or cotton.=20

Pins, No. 14.  Cast on 14. Knit the desired length, cast off 4 stitches, an=
d then unravel all the rest.=20

_Woollen Fringe._  (VERY HANDSOME.)   Have some ends ready cut, and cast on=
 7 stitches.=20

First row=E2=80=94knit 1, bring the wool forward, knit 2 together; take one=
 of the lengths and double it,=20

hang it on the right-hand needle, knit 2 stitches, bring the double ends of=
 wool forward, knit 1=20

stitch, put the end back, and knit the last stitch.  Second row=E2=80=94kni=
t every stitch plain, taking up with=20

the 4th stitch the loop of fringe wool, and being careful not to split eith=
er of them. Continue to the=20

end of the row plain.  Third row=E2=80=94the same as 1st.  Fourth row=E2=80=
=94the same as 2nd. Repeat.=20

_Lady=E2=80=99s Scarlet and White Petticoat._  (WORN INSTEAD OF A FLANNEL O=
NE.)   Wooden pins=20

about 17 inches long, and then cast on all the stitches you require. With p=
ins No. 5 cast on 360,=20

and knit with scarlet for 1 inch; then 2 inches of white, then 2 inches of =
scarlet. Now do the rest of=20

the petticoat in double knitting, or some fancy stitch. (See page 42.) When=
 it is 26 inches long rib=20

21 rows in 2 plain, 2 pearl, and cast off. Knit a simple crochet scarlet ed=
ging. These petticoats pull=20

out several inches longer after being washed.     _Lady=E2=80=99s Petticoat=
, to cost 10s. 6d._   Both these=20

petticoats take about 15 skeins of petticoat yarn. Bone pins, No. 5.  Begin=
 with scarlet, if preferred,=20

as above; but this pattern is given for entire white wool.  Cast on 120, an=
d knit 25 inches plain,=20



then rib by doing 2 plain and 2 pearl for 24 rows. Cast off. Do another bre=
adth; and for the 3rd and=20

front breadth you must, after the first 12 rounds, decrease at the beginnin=
g and end of each row=20

about every two inches. If you do not like to have a gored breadth do this =
one exactly the same as=20

the other two. Crochet some scalloped edges round the bottom of the pettico=
at, after having joined=20

the breadths together. These petticoats are beautifully warm and last for a=
 long time. Summer=20

ones can be knitted with the same pins in Scotch wheeling-yarn or 2-thread =
fleecy, which are=20

much cheaper but not so nice and soft. It makes a charming finish to put a =
border as on page 44.=20

You need only make the petticoat 24 inches long in that case.     _For a Co=
mmon Quilt._   Cast on=20

with cotton 2 stitches, use pins about No. 14, and increase every row. Do 6=
 rows of plain and 6 of=20

pearl, so as to make lengthway ribs. When half a square is done decrease at=
 the beginning of=20

every row. When a sufficient number of squares are finished join together w=
ith a square piece of=20

calico between each knitted one. Thus: take a piece of calico, turn down th=
e raw edges, double it=20

to the size of the knitted square, and tack the two edges together. Then se=
w the knitting and the=20

calico together, as if you were doing patchwork. The raw edges of the calic=
o must, of course, be=20

turned inwards, meeting each other so as not to be seen even on the wrong s=
ide of the quilt. This=20

is a quick and neat quilt, but is not so pretty as the other patterns.     =

Cotton, and pins No. 14 or 15. It makes a beautiful berceaunette cover in 2=
 or 3-thread fleecy, and=20

bone pins. The price so entirely depends on the size of quilt desired that =
it is impossible to give it=20

exactly. It is a very handsome pattern.  This quilt is made in squares and =
joined afterwards.  Cast=20

old Coast: pay there=20

was high and promotion rapid, but no one had ever been known to live long e=
nough to take a=20

pension.  Magnums of the driest and most expensive champagne seemed to be t=
he favourite=20

beverage. But the whisters as a rule drank claret, in anticipation of the m=
ore serious _business_=20

that was sure to follow the weekly house-dinner. Captains Spotstroke and Po=

careful; the rest of every row.  Twenty-ninth row=E2=80=94pearl, then a pla=

row, plain another row, pearl. Continue thus in lengthway ribs of 3, until =
you have decreased to=20

  _Maltese Pattern._=20

Strutt=E2=80=99s knitting-cotton No. 6, and pins No. 16.  This is one of th=

but it must be knitted much tighter than ordinary work. Twist the cotton tw=

followed by a general move. Old Sir Peter Growler and Canon Drivel, D.D., r=
etired to the smoke-

room, where they retailed their old, but exceedingly improper anecdotes, to=
 a select circle of the=20

very youngest men. In the billiard-room, pool at half sovereign lives, was =
commenced, and=20

promised to run into the small hours--a sure harvest for Captains Spotstrok=
e and Pool. In=20

confidence it may be said that Spotstroke's little place in the south of Ir=
eland only existed in his=20

own imagination, his rents being entirely derived from his skill with his c=
ue, and the certain income=20

that he extracted from the very safe little book that he made on most of th=
e great events of the=20

year. A small contingent of the members hurried off to applaud the successf=
ul comic opera of the=20

hour.  The card-room attracted its usual _habitues_, these sat down to whis=
t; and if an unskilled=20

unfortunate joined the fatal tables, he soon had reason to regret his temer=
ity. Pound points were=20

habitually played at the Pandemonium, and as the evening went on, though th=
e points never=20

varied, betting among the players and the "gallery" usually became extremel=
y heavy. Discussions=20

never arose at the whist tables of quite tight.  When your squares are done=
, sew them together at=20

the plain part, at the beginning, where the increasings were made. They oug=

rather fast club, for the players had Cavendish and Pole at their fingers' =
ends. General Pepper,=20

C.B., had raised his eyes in unfeigned astonishment and horror, when an old=
 Worcestershire=20

baronet, his partner, once made a reference to Hoyle, and professed himself=
 unacquainted with=20

"the Peter." Needless to say, the Worcestershire baronet had returned to hi=
s ancestral acres a=20

sadder but a wiser man. He showed his wisdom in giving the Pandemonium card=
-room a very=20

wide berth for the rest of his days. He subsequently had the good sense to =
join the comic opera=20

division, and to finish his evenings with the undeniable oysters, for which=
 the Pandemonium is so=20

celebrated. No one was ever seen at this well-known club after lunch time o=
r before dinner, save a=20

few miserable veterans, to whom perpetual whist was a necessity. The bulk o=
f the servants even,=20

only commenced their daily duties at dusk, while the rest.  Forty-fourth ro=

you do the third division again of 2 plain, 2 pearl, according to the patte=
rn; always decreasing at=20

the beginning. In the last row of this division you knit every stitch. You =
ought to have 27 stitches,=20

and the rest of the square is plain knitting.  It is an improvement after t=
he quilt is finished to run=20

blue ribbon round the holes which surround the cross, to define it, and bri=

_Canadian Cloud._   Wooden pins, No. 1; 10 skeins of white and 2 of scarlet=
 Shetland wool.  Cast=20

oom that I O U's were never=20

seen, the play being always for ready money, in notes and gold. Mr. Levison=

(originally from Hamburg), had a very Pactolus ready for the accommodation,=

of his numerous masters, in his iron safe. Levison's Double the cloud lengt=

morning. Though it is in the height of summer the Pandemonium card-room is =
cool; they burn wax=20

candles here, and gas is absolutely banished from this particular chamber o=
f the club, where=20

fortunes are sometimes lost and won. In most club card-rooms smoking is not=
 permitted, but at the=20

Pandemonium it is the fashion to smoke everywhere. One whist table only is =
at work; General=20
