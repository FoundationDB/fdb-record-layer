ut unavoidable. He=20

promised, but he has not brought them. Probably this last request has done =
for me, and he is now=20

communicating with the police....  A tap at my door. "Please, de tings!" sa=

before. It has flowers embroidered all down the front and round the cuffs, =
and on every button=20

something is worked in tiny blue letters, which, on inspection, turns out t=

quite know why, but, in my present state, I find this strangely consoling, =
and even touching--like a=20

benediction. After all, he _must_ believe in me, or he would hardly confide=

KILLING NO MURDER.  (_TO THE EDITOR OF "PUNCH."_)  MY DEAR SIR,--I have jus=
t been=20

reading with a great deal of surprise "_The Life and Letters of Charles Sam=
uel Keene_, by=20

GEORGE SOMES LAYARD." Seeing the name of one of your colleagues as the firs=
t line of the=20

"Index," I turned to page 74 and looked him out. I found him mentioned in a=
n account given by Mr.=20

M.H. SPIELMANN of the _Punch_ Dinner, which Mr. GEORGE SOMES LAYARD had ext=
racted=20

from _Black and White_, no doubt to assist in making quickly. Permit me, th=
en, my dear Athos,=20

without inquiring further about our friend, to pay my respects to M. Planch=
et."  "Ah, monsieur le=20

chevalier," said Planchet, bowing.  "Lieutenant?" asked Aramis.  "Lieutenan=
t, with a promise of=20

becoming captain."  "'Tis capital; and pray, how did you acquire all these =
honors?"  "In the first=20

place, gentlemen, you know that I was the means of Monsieur de Rochefort's =
escape; well, I was=20

very near being hung by Mazarin and that made me more popular than ever."  =
"So, owing to your=20

popularity----"  "No; thanks to something better. You know, gentlemen, that=
 I served the Piedmont=20

regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant?"  "Yes."  "Well, one day wh=
en no one could drill=20

a mob of citizens, who began to march, some with the right foot, others wit=
h the left, I succeeded, I=20

did, in making them all begin with the same foot, and I was made lieutenant=
 on the spot."  "So I=20

presume," said Athos, "that you have a large number of the nobles with you?=
"  "Certainly. There=20

are the Prince de Conti, the Duc de Longueville, the Duc de Beaufort, the D=
uc de Bouillon, the=20

Marechal de la Mothe, the Marquis de Sevigne, and I don't know who, for my =
part."  "And the=20

Vicomte Raoul de Bragelonne?" inquired Athos, in a tremulous voice. "D'Arta=
gnan told me that he=20

had recommended him to your care, in parting."  "Yes, count; nor have I los=
t sight of him for a=20



single instant since."  "Then," said Athos in a tone of delight, "he is wel=
l? no accident has=20

happened to him?"  "None, sir."  "And he lives?"  "Still at the Hotel of th=
e Great Charlemagne."=20

"And passes his time?"  "Sometimes with the queen of England, sometimes wit=
h Madame de=20

Chevreuse. He and the Count de Guiche are like each other's shadows."  "Tha=
nks, Planchet,=20

thanks!" cried Athos, extending his hand to the lieutenant.  "Oh, sir!" Pla=
nchet only touched the=20

tips of the count's fingers.  "Well, what are you doing, count--to a former=
 lackey?  "My friend," said=20

Athos, "he has given me news of Raoul."  "And now, gentlemen," said Planche=
t, who had not=20

heard what they were saying, "what do you intend to do?"  "Re-enter Paris, =
if you will let us, my=20

good Planchet."  "Let you, sir? Now, as ever, I am nothing but your servant=
." Then turning to his=20

men:  "Allow these gentlemen to pass," he said; "they are friends of the Du=
c de Beaufort."  "Long=20

live the Duc de Beaufort!" cried the sentinels.  The sergeant drew near to =
Planchet.  "What!=20

without passports?" he murmured.  "Without passports," said Planchet.  "Tak=
e notice, captain," he=20

continued, giving Planchet his expected title, "take notice that one of the=
 three men who just now=20

went out from here told me privately to distrust these gentlemen."  "And I,=
" said Planchet, with=20

dignity, "I know them and I answer for them."  As he said this, he pressed =
Grimaud's hand, who=20

seemed honored by the distinction.  "Farewell till we meet again," said Ara=
mis, as they took leave=20

of Planchet; "if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it."  "Sir,"=
 said Planchet, "I am in all=20

things at your service."  "That fellow is no fool," said Aramis, as he got =
on his horse.  "How should=20

he be?" replied Athos, whilst mounting also, "seeing he was used so long to=
 brush your hats."=20

76. The Ambassadors.   The two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of t=
he Faubourg, but on=20

arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of Paris had=
 become rivers, and the=20

open places lakes; after the great rains which fell in January the Seine ha=
d overflowed its banks=20

and the river inundated half the capital. The two gentlemen were obliged, t=
herefore, to get off their=20

horses and take a boat; and in that strange manner they approached the Louv=
re.  Night had=20

closed in, and Paris, seen thus, by the light of lanterns flickering on the=
 pools of water, crowded=20

with ferry-boats of every kind, including those that glittered with the arm=
ed patrols, with the=20

watchword, passing from post to post--Paris presented such an aspect as to =
strongly seize the=20

senses of Aramis, a man most susceptible to warlike impressions.  They reac=
hed the queen's=20

apartments, but were compelled to stop in the ante-chamber, since her majes=
ty was at that=20

moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from England.  "We, t=
oo," said Athos, to=20

the footman who had given him that answer, "not only bring news from Englan=
d, but have just=20

come from there."  "What? then, are your names, gentlemen?"  "The Comte de =
la Fere and the=20

Chevalier d'Herblay," said Aramis.  "Ah! in that case, gentlemen," said the=
 footman, on hearing the=20

names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope, "in that case it i=
s another thing, and I=20

think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment. Please =
follow me," and he=20

went on before, followed by Athos and Aramis.  On arriving at the door of t=
he room where the=20

queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door:  =
"Madame," he said, "I=20

hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders, when you lear=
n that the gentlemen I=20

have come to announce are the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier d'Herblay.=
"  On hearing those=20

two names the queen uttered a cry of joy, which the two gentlemen heard.  "=
Poor queen!"=20

murmured Athos.  "Oh, let them come in! let them come in," cried the young =
princess, bounding to=20

the door.  The poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and =
sought by her filial=20



attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other dau=
ghter.  "Come in,=20

gentlemen," repeated the princess, opening the door herself.  The queen was=
 seated on a fauteuil=20

and before her were standing two or three gentlemen, and among them the Duc=
 de Chatillon, the=20

brother of the nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on =
account of Madame de=20

Longueville, on the Place Royale. All these gentlemen had been noticed by A=
thos and Aramis in=20

the guardhouse, and when the two friends were announced they started and ex=
changed some=20

words in a low tone. "Well, sirs!" cried the queen, on perceiving the two f=
riends, "you have come,=20

faithful friends! But the royal couriers have been more expeditious than yo=
u, and here are=20

Monsieur de Flamarens and Monsieur de Chatillon, who bring me from Her Maje=
sty the Queen=20

Anne of Austria, the very latest intelligence."  Aramis and Athos were asto=
unded by the calmness,=20

even the gayety of the queen's manner.  "Go on with your recital, sirs," sa=
id the queen, turning to=20

the Duc de Chatillon. "You said that His Majesty, King Charles, my august c=
onsort, had been=20

condemned to death by a majority of his subjects!"  "Yes, madame,"=20

ably absent, another=20

writer--usually, nowadays, Mr. ARTHUR A'BECKETT--takes his place, the duty =
never falling to an=20

artist." Then, to show how thoroughly Mr. GEORGE SOMES LAYARD is up to date=
, he adds to=20

the name of Mr. ARTHUR A'BECKETT (after the fashion of _Mr. Punch_ in the d=
rama disposing of=20

ces, even if they be as brief=20

STUDIES IN THE NEW POETRY.  The world is of course aware by this time that =
a New Poetry=20

has arisen, and has asserted itself by the mouths of many loud-voiced "boom=
ers." It has been=20

_Mr. Punch's_ good fortune to secure several specimens of this new product,=
 not through the=20

intervention of middle men, but from the manufacturers themselves. He propo=
ses to publish them=20

for the benefit and enlightenment of his readers. But first a word of warni=
ng. There are perhaps=20

some who believe that a poem should not only express high and noble thought=
s, or recount great=20

deeds, but that it should do so in verse that is musical, cadenced, rhythmi=
cal, instinct with grace,=20

and reserved rather than boisterous. If any such there be, let them know at=
 once that they are=20

hopelessly old-fashioned. The New Poetry in its _highest_ expression banish=
es form, regularity=20

and rhythm, and treats rhyme with unexampled barbarity. Here and there, it =
is true, rhymes get=20

paired off quite happily in the conventional manner, but directly afterward=
s you may come upon a=20

poor weak little rhyme who will cry in vain for his mate through half a doz=
en interloping lines.=20

Indeed, cases have been known of rhymes that have been left on a sort of de=
sert island of a=20

verse, and have never been fetched away. And sometimes when the lines have =
got chopped very=20

short, the rhymes have tumbled overboard altogether. That is really what is=
 meant by=20

"impressionism" in poetry carried to its highest excellence. There are, of =
course, other forms of the=20

New Poetry. There is the "blustering, hob-nailed" variety which clatters up=
 and down with immense=20

noise, elbows you here, and kicks you there, and if it finds a pardonable w=
eakness strolling about=20

in the middle of the street, immediately knocks it down and tramples upon i=
t. Then too there is the=20

"coarse, but manly" kind which swears by the great god, Jingo, and keeps a =
large stock of spread=20

eagles always ready to swoop and tear without the  Athos and Aramis were mo=
re and more=20

astonished.  "And that being conducted to the scaffold," resumed the queen-=
-"oh, my lord! oh, my=20

king!--and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant=
 people."  "Just so=20

madame," replied Chatillon, in so low a voice that though the two friends w=
ere listening eagerly=20

they could hardly hear this affirmation.  The queen clasped her hands in en=
thusiastic gratitude,=20

whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mother's neck and kissed her-=
-her own eyes=20

streaming with tears.  "Now, madame, nothing remains to me except to proffe=
r my respectful=20

homage," said Chatillon, who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern ga=
ze of Athos.  "One=20

moment, yes," answered the queen. "One moment--I beg--for here are the Chev=
alier d'Herblay=20

and the Comte de la Fere, just arrived from London, and they can give you, =
as eye-witnesses,=20

such details as you can convey to the queen, my royal sister. Speak, gentle=
men, speak--I am=20

listening; conceal nothing, gloss over nothing. Since his majesty still liv=
es, since the honor of the=20



throne is safe, everything else is a matter of indifference to me."  Athos =
turned pale and laid his=20

hand on his heart.  "Well!" exclaimed the queen, who remarked this movement=
 and his paleness.=20

"Speak, sir! I beg you to do so."  "I beg you to excuse me, madame; I wish =
to add nothing to the=20

recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have pe=
rhaps been mistaken."=20

"Mistaken!" cried the queen, almost suffocated by emotion; "mistaken! what =
has happened, then?"=20

"Sir," interposed Monsieur de Flamarens to Athos, "if we are mistaken the e=
rror has originated with=20

the queen. I do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to righ=
ts--that would be to=20

accuse Her Majesty, Queen Anne, of falsehood."  "With the queen, sir?" repl=
ied Athos, in his calm,=20

vibrating voice.  "Yes," murmured Flamarens, lowering his eyes.  Athos sigh=
ed deeply.  "Or rather,=20

sir," said Aramis, with his peculiar irritating politeness, "the error of t=
he person who was with you=20

when we met you in the guardroom; for if the Comte de la Fere and I are not=
 mistaken, we saw=20

you in the company of a third gentleman."  Chatillon and Flamarens started.=
  "Explain yourself,=20

count!" cried the queen, whose anxiety grew greater every moment. "On your =
brow I read despair-

-your lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidings--your hands trembl=
e. Oh, my God! my God!=20

what has happened?"  "Lord!" ejaculated the young princess, falling on her =
knees, "have mercy on=20

us!"  "Sir," said Chatillon, "if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in =
you to announce them to the=20

queen."  Aramis went so close to Chatillon as almost to touch him.  "Sir," =
said he, with compressed=20

lips and flashing eyes, "you have not the presumption to instruct the Comte=
 de la Fere and myself=20

what we ought to say here?"  During this brief altercation Athos, with his =
