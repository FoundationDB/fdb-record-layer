to enjoy the same privilege. We are a social people and the accosting by one of another in an 

inoffensive way and offer by the one to communicate and discuss information with a view to 

influencing the other's action, are not regarded as aggression, or a violation of that other's right.  If, 

however, the offer is declined, as it may rightfully be, then persistence, importunity, and following 

do become unjustifiable annoyance and obstruction which is likely soon to savor of intimidation. 

The nearer this is to the place of business, the greater the interference with the business and 

especially with the property right of access of the employer. Such an attempted discussion attracts 

the curious, or, it may be, interested bystanders. They increase the obstruction as well as the 

aspect of intimidation which the situation quickly assumes.  In the present case, under the 

conditions which the evidence discloses, all information tendered, all arguments advanced and all 

persuasion used were intimidation--they could not be otherwise.  It is idle to talk of peaceful 

communication in such a place and under such conditions. The numbers of the pickets in the 

groups constituted intimidation. The name "picket" indicated a militant purpose, inconsistent with 

peaceful persuasion. The employs were made to run the gauntlet. When one or more assaults or 

disturbances ensued, they characterized the whole campaign, which became effective because of 

its intimidating character, in spite of the admonitions given by the leaders to their followers as to 

lawful methods to be pursued, however sincere.  Our conclusion is that picketing thus instituted is 

unlawful and cannot be peaceable, and may be properly enjoined by the specific term of 

"picketing" in Water to steep eight or ten Days, shifting them to fresh Waters twice a Day; then boil 

them in several Waters, till they are tender enough to run a Straw through them. Then take one 

Pound of double-refin'd Loaf-Sugar to each Pound of Peel, and a Quart of Water: then make your 

Syrup, and boil your Peels in it eight or ten Minutes, and let them stand in your Syrup five or six 

Days, in an earthen glaz'd Vessel, for it would spoil in a Brass or Copper Pan: then to every Pound 

put one Pound more of Sugar into your Syrup, and boil your Peels in it, till they are clear; then put 

them into Gallypots, and boil your Syrup till it is almost of a Candy height, and pour it upon your 

Peels; and when it is cold, cover it. The same manner they preserve the Peels of green Oranges, 

Lemons, and Limes, in _Barbadoes_.    To stew _Soles._ From _Yarmouth._  Take the largest

stick of Horse-Radish, a bunch of sweet Herbs, a large Onion, half a large Nutmeg, some Cloves 

and Mace, whole Pepper, and Salt, with a little bit of Butter. Then stew these till the Fish is 

enough, and pour off the Liquor, through a Sieve, and thicken it with burnt Butter, having first put

the controversy by those who are parties to it. We are supported in that view by many well-

reasoned authorities, although there has been contrarity of view. A restraining order against 

picketing by that name will advise earnest advocates of labor's cause that the law does not look 

with favor on an enforced discussion of the merits of the issue between individuals who wish to 

work and groups of those who do not, under conditions which subject the individuals who wish to 

work to a severe test of their nerves and physical strength and courage.  But while this is so, we 

must have every regard for the Congressional intention manifested in the Act to the principle of 

existing law which declares that ex-employs and others properly acting with them shall have an 

opportunity, so far as is consistent with peace and law, to observe who are still working for the 

employer, to communicate with them and to persuade them to join the ranks of his opponents in a 

lawful, economic struggle.  Regarding as primary the rights of the employs to work for whom they 

will, and to go freely to and from their place of labor, and keeping in mind the right of the employer 

incident to his property and business to free access of such employs, what can be done to 

reconcile the conflicting interests?  Each case must turn on its own circumstances. It is a case for 

the flexible, remedial power of a Court of equity which may try one mode of restraint, and if it fails 

or proves to be too drastic, may change it.                           McGANN CO. v. LABRECQUE CO. 

(Essex Circuit Court, Jan., 1922).        _Action of Trespass--Lease and Sale of Property--Limitation 

of Term--Jurisdiction of District Court_.       Case of Joseph F. McCann, trading as The McGann 

Company, against     La Brecque Company. Action at law. Trespass.      Mr. Milton M. Ungur for 

Plaintiff.      Messrs. Burnett, Sorg, Murray & Duncan for Defendant. 

(CONCLUSIONS).  DUNGAN, J.: This is an action of trespass brought by the plaintiff against the 

defendant for the wrongful removal of plaintiff's goods from the defendant's premises under the 

following conditions:  P. Ballentine & Sons, a corporation, demised the premises in question to 

defendant by lease dated August 1st, 1917, for a term commencing November 1st, 1916, and 

terminating April 30th, 1926. The lease provided:  "It is further understood and agreed between the 

parties hereto that a sale of the property by the party of the first part shall terminate this lease 

upon six months' written notice to the party of the second part; and, in lieu of compensation, it is 

hereby agreed that the rent shall be waived during the six months notice to vacate."  By deed 

dated October 15, 1918, proved October 30, 1918, and recorded October 31, 1918, P. Ballentine 

& Sons conveyed the premises in question by warranty deed to the plaintiff, subject to the above 

tenancy. By endorsement dated April 30, 1918, made upon the lease, P. Ballentine & Sons 

assigned said lease and all of the rights of the lessor thereunder, to the plaintiff.  October 30, 

1918, there was served personally upon defendant a notice, dated on that day, signed by both the 

grantor and the grantee in the deed last mentioned, as follows:  "You will please take notice that 

the premises leased by you from P. Ballentine & Sons by written lease dated the first day of 

August, 1917, have this day been sold to LaBrecque Company, Inc., and notice of the cancellation 

of your said lease is hereby given you pursuant to that clause of your lease reading as follows: 'It 

is further understood and agreed between the parties hereto that a sale of the property by the 

party of the first part shall terminate this lease upon six months' written notice to the party of the 

second part, and in lieu of compensation it is hereby agreed that the rent shall be waived during 

the six months' notice to vacate.'"  The defendant did not remove from said premises at the 

expiration of six months and the statutory demand for delivery of possession was personally 



served on defendant. After the expiration of said period, he refused to vacate the premises, and 

thereupon the defendant here instituted and prosecuted summary proceedings in the Second 

District Court of the City of Newark, in which Court judgment for possession of the premises was 

rendered May 23, 1919, and the removal of plaintiffs, being the alleged act of trespass for which 

this suit is brought, was, by virtue of the order of removal, made by that Court upon said judgment. 

There is no contention that there was any irregularity in the proceedings of that Court, if the Court 

has jurisdiction; but the plaintiff here insists that the provisions of the lease above quoted 

constituted a condition, or covenant, and not a limitation of the term, and that consequently the 

District Court did not have jurisdiction.  The parties hereto have entered into a stipulation to submit 

this suit to the Court for judgment upon the complaint, answer and reply, which correctly sets forth 

the facts as above stated, and adds:  "If the Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to 

recover, judgment is to be rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, and there is 

to be an assessment of the damages by a jury drawn for that purpose, reserving however all 

questions of law as to the measure of damages; and, if the Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff 

is not entitled to recover, judgment shall be entered in favor of the defendant as if said cause had 

been tried and a verdict in favor of the defendant had been rendered"; both parties reserving the 

right to appeal from the judgment to be entered.  It is admitted on behalf of the plaintiff that, if the 

said provision of the lease constituted limitation of McGann's terms, then the District Court had 

jurisdiction and the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit.  The jurisdiction of the District Court in such 

cases is confined in its application to the instant case, to "When any such person shall hold over 

and continue in possession ... after the expiration of his ... term," etc. Admittedly the decision of 

this case rests upon whether or not the sale of the premises and the notice given by the lessor and 

LaBrecque Company to the plaintiff ended the term of the McGann Company. If it did--if this was a 

limitation of the plaintiff's term,--the jurisdiction of the District Court was complete.  The case of 

Quidort v. Bullitt, 60 N. J. L. 119, is very much in point. In that case it appeared by the affidavit 

filed with the Justice that the defendants, in May, 1885, leased to the prosecutor a seaside cottage 

at Cape May for five years, which lease was extended for two successful periods. The lease 

contained the following provision: "Lessors are to have the privilege of terminating the lease at any 

time upon giving six months' notice of their intention to do so, prior to the first day of July or any 

year during the lease.". On October 19, 1895, the defendants caused to be served on the 

prosecutor a written notice, which, after reciting the terms of the lease stated:  "We have 

determined to avail ourselves of the privilege of terminating the lease. We now give you notice of 

the exercise of our privilege and of our intention to terminate the said lease on the first day of May, 

1896, and demand that you surrender us possession of the leased premises at that time, in 

accordance with the provisions contained in the lease. This right to terminate the lease is 

exercised in accordance with the lease and the several extensions thereof. We shall expect you to 

deliver to us, on the first day of May, 1896, the cottage and bath houses mentioned in the said 

lease, and also the articles mentioned and set out in the inventory annexed thereto."  The tenant 

refused to deliver possession and, on the 6th day of May, 1896, instituted proceedings before the 

Justice, which were the subject of review by certiorari in that case.  It is insisted on behalf of the 

plaintiff that whether or not the quoted provision of the lease and the giving of the notice 

constituted a mere condition or covenant or was a limitation, was not decided in that case; but, 



while it is not expressly so stated, it seems to me a decision of that question was absolutely 

essential to a decision of the case. Chief Justice Pepper, Salt, and some Nutmeg. Cover these 

close, and let them stew till they are tender; then pour in a Glass or two of Claret; and when it is 

warm, clear your Sauce of the Onion, Herbs, _&c_. and thicken it with burnt Butter. It is an 

excellent Dish. Serve it hot, and garnish with Lemon diced, and red Beet-Roots, Capers, and such 

like.    Thin _Beef-Collups_ stew'd. From _Oxford._  Cut raw Beef in thin Slices, as you would do 

Veal, for _Scots_ Collups; lay them in a Dish, with a little Water, a Glass of Wine, a Shallot, some 

Pepper and Salt, and a little sweet Marjoram powdered; then clap another Dish over that, having 

first put a thin slice or two of fat Bacon among your Collups: then set your Mess, so as to rest upon 

the backs of two Chairs, and take six Sheets of whited-brown Paper, and tear it in long Pieces; 

and then lighting one of them, hold it under the Dish, till it burns out, then light another, and so 

another till all your Paper is burnt; and then your Stew will be enough, and full of Gravey. Some 

will put in a little Mushroom Gravey, with the Water, and the other Ingredients, which is yet a very 

good way.    Stew'd _Beef-Steaks._ From the _Spring-Gardens_ at _Vaux-Hall, Surrey._  Take 

good Rump-Beef Steaks, and season them with Pepper and Salt; then lay them into the Pan, and 

pour in a little Water; then add a bunch of sweet Herbs a few Cloves, an Anchovy, a little Verjuice, 

an Onion, and a little Lemon-Peel, with a little bit of Butter, or fat Bacon, and a Glass of White 

Wine. Cover these close, and stew them gently, and when they are tender, pour away the Sauce, 

and strain it; then take out the Steaks, and flour them, and fry them; and when you put them in the 

Dish, thicken the Sauce, and pour it over them. This way was much approved.    To make 

_Cologn's-Geneva._ From _Cologn._  Take good Brandy, one Gallon; then take two Pounds of 

Juniper-berries fresh gather'd, and full ripe. Press these till you perceive a greenish Liquor come 

from them; then put them into the Brandy, and let them remain about ten Days: then pour them 

through a Cloth of coarse Linnen, and squeeze it, and when you have the Liquor, if you find it too 

strong, you may add to it some more Brandy, and half a Pound of fine Sugar to a Gallon. Then put 

it in Flasks, or Bottles.  Then take the Pressings, and infuse them again in Brandy, for six or seven 

Days, and distil them. This they call double _Cologn's_ Gin, and the best is sold in _Holland_, at 

three Shillings and Six-pence _per_ Quart.    To make _Scots-Snuff,_ or pure _Tobacco-Snuff._ 

From Mr. _Hyslop._  Take the Leaves of good Tobacco, and spread them open; then dry them 

gently in the Sun, or before the Fire, and strip them from the Stalks; when the leafy part will 

crumble, between the Fingers; then put it into a Mill, and with a Pestle rolling about it, the Tobacco 

will presently be ground, as fine as Snuff; or else, if you have never a Mill, when your Tobacco will 

break between the Fingers, lay it on an oaken Table, and pass the flat side of a Knife over it, 

backwards and forwards, as if you was whetting it, pressing it hard, and you will make fine Snuff. 

This I mention here, because, sometimes, the Snuff-takers are without Snuff, and remote from any 

Place where it may be had, and would give any Money for it; which was my Case, when I learn'd 

this Receipt, and by the last Means was presently supplied: we may make it likewise of cut 

Tobacco dry'd before the Fire.  Or if we raise Tobacco in our Gardens, pick the Leaves from the 

Stalks, towards the Root, when they are full grown, tie six in a bunch together, and hang them up 

to dry in the Shade; then dip them in Water, or some Beer or Ale, and hang them up again to dry, 

and then press the Leaves one upon another, in their Bunches, in a Box or Tub, as hard as 

possible; and in a few Months time, they will make very good Snuff, being order'd as above 



directed.    _Butter_ turned to _Oil_ recovered. From Mrs. _M. N._  There are some Lands, as well 

as some Treatments of Butter in the Dairy, that makes the Butter so very fat and greasy, that it is 

hard to melt, without running to Oil; while, on the other hand, there is a sort of Butter, which cuts 

as firm as Wax; and even this will sometimes turn to Oil in the melting, but very seldom. However, 

when it so happens, pour your oil'd Butter into a Porringer, and letting it stand a little, melt a little 

fresh, and as soon as it is liquid, pour into it, by gentle degrees, at times, some of the Butter that 

was oil'd before, keeping your Sauce-pan shaking all the while; and if you find it any way difficult to 

be recovered, pour in a little Milk, and shake them together, and it will recover. _Memorandum_, A 

Sauce-pan that is very thin at the Bottom is apt to oil Butter, let it be ever so good.    _Orange_ or 

_Lemon-Cakes._ From the same.  Take some preserv'd Orange or Lemon-Peels, wash'd from 

their Syrup; then beat them, in a Marble Mortar, to a Pulp, adding a little Orange-Flower Water to 

them, and a very little Gum-Arabic to it powder'd, this will become a Paste; then mould it into 

Cakes, with double-refined Sugar beaten fine, and dry them; they must then be laid in Boxes, 

between sheets of white Paper, and kept in a dry Place.    To dry _Plums,_ of any sort, without 

_Sugar._ From the same.  Take a Wyre Sieve, and gather your Plums, not too ripe, nor in the heat 

of the Day; run a Needle through the Skin of each of them, and lay them on the Sieve, so as not to 

touch one another. Put your Sieve then into a declining Oven, and let it stand twelve Hours; then 

set it by, and repeat the same the second and third time, and if the Plums are large, then it may be 

they will require the fourth or fifth time; but turn them every time, when you are going to put them 

in the Oven. They will dry by this Means so well, that you may keep them all the Winter, for use, in 

Boxes, in a dry Place. _Memorandum_, Some of them will candy on the Outsides. The Mussel-

Plum is a very good one for this use.    The _Shropshire_ and _Worcestershire-Dish._ From the 

same.  Sir,  If you would please all People, by the several Receipts you publish, you ought to have 

the particular Dish that is the Favourite of every County. In _Worcestershire_ and _Shropshire_, 

the following is in esteem, and I believe you will oblige several Gentlemen and Ladies of these 

Parts, if you would insert it in some of your Works.  Take some good middling Bacon, and fry it; 

then put in some Calf's Liver, and cut it in thick Pieces, pepper it, and salt it; and when it is 

enough, for it must not be fry'd hard, have ready prepared some Cabbage-Lettuce, some white 

Beet-Cards, or Beet-Leaves, and some Spinach-Leaves, and chop them together, with some 

Parsley, but not too small; then chop some Onion, and mix with the rest; then throw them into your 

Frying pan, with a piece of Butter, when the Bacon and Liver is out, and fry them till they are 

tender, and as brown as may be; putting in a spoonful of Verjuice, or the Juice of a Lemon, a little 

before they are enough. And having kept the Liver and Bacon hot all the while, pour these Herbs 

over them, which ought to be in good quantity.    Fine _Cakes_ to keep. From the same.  Take a 

Pound of fine Sugar powder'd, and somewhat less than a Quart of Flour. Rub these with a Pound 

of fresh Butter, and mix it with three or four Yolks of Eggs, with some Orange-Flower-Water, and a 

little Ale-Yeast: set this Paste before the Fire to rise, and roll out your Cakes thin, while the Paste 

is hot; then cut them into what Shapes you please, and prick them on the top, and bake them in a 

gentle Oven. They will keep a long time and are very good.    To make _Penzance-Cakes._ From 

the same.  Take the Yolks of Eggs well beaten, put to them some Mace finely powder'd, with a few 

spoonfuls of Wine, a little Salt, and as much Sugar as you please; then add as much Flour as is 

necessary, and a small quantity of Ale-Yeast, and work your Dough pretty stiff; then add some 



fresh Butter, broken in little bits, and work it in till all the Paste has partaken of it, and the Dough 

becomes as stiff as at first. Make your Cakes then, and bake them. They will keep some time. 

To make Crystal candy'd _Sweet-meats._ From the same.  When we propose to make these 

candy'd Sweet-meats, we must first know what Fruits, Flowers, _&c_. are proper for them, and 

how those 


_
120) said:  "The question for determination is whether the Justice had jurisdiction of the cause; if 

he had jurisdiction, then the writ in this case should be dismissed, but, if he had not, then the 

proceedings before him should be set aside."  Again on page 122 he said:  It is alleged by the 

prosecutor that the facts above recited did not bring the case within the jurisdiction of the Justice 

for the following reasons: 1. That the privilege of terminating the lease was not a term, condition or 

limitation of the original lease, but a special privilege, reserved to the lessors, of ending the original 

term."  Thus it is plain that the precise question in issue in this case was before the Court, and that 

it was necessary for the Court, in order to reach the decision it did, to decide that the quoted 

provision would constitute a limitation upon the term fixed by the original lease.  The case of Miller 

v. Levi, 44 N. Y. 490, is also applicable to this case. In that case Miller demised to Levi, reserving 

the right to sell the demised premises and to limit Levi's term thereon to the expiration of sixty 

days after notice of sale. The sale and notice specified in the lease was made. It was insisted that 

the Justice had no jurisdiction of the summary proceedings, because this can only be resorted to 

where the term of the lease of the lessee "has expired by lapse of time," which it was said was not 

the fact in that case. The Court said:  "Immediately upon sale by Miller and notice thereof to the 

tenant the limitation attached to the estate of the latter, without further act on the part of Miller. 

There then arose a limitation of his term, to wit, its expiration on the first of May following. The act 

itself, in the lease contemplated, to wit, a sale without notice, created the expiration. Nothing 

further was necessary.... The 'term' of the lease must therefore be taken to have 'expired' on the 

first of May, 1864."  I think, therefore, that when the leased property was sold, and the notice of 

sale given to McGann on October 30th, 1918, the term of McGann under the terms of the lease 

expired six months thereafter; that the sale and notice constituted a limitation of his term; that the 

Second District Court of the City of Newark, before which proceedings to remove McGann were 

instituted May 2nd, 1919, had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter before it; and that, 

therefore, the defendant is not guilty of the trespass alleged against him.  Judgment is given, 

therefore, against the plaintiff and in gathered and prepared.  First of all, to begin with the Flowers. 

Take Orange-Flowers, or Lemon, or Citron-Flowers; gather them, when the Dew is upon them, in 

the Morning, because the Leaves of them will be then full, and then they are best to use, when the 

Leaves are pick'd off, and then the Dew will be gone; but if they lie a Day, they will shrink, turn 

bitter, and of a yellowish brown Colour. Take these Leaves fresh pick'd, and pour the following 

Composition upon them.  You may take also some Orange, or Lemon, or Citron, preserved, and 

dry'd, and cut them in small pieces. Or Apricots dry'd and cut into small pieces, or such sorts as 

are a little hard in themselves will do. If one was to cut some Pine-Apple, or Ananas, simply or 

preserv'd, and cut that in pieces, it would be entomb'd in a Rock of Sugar; or Currans preserv'd 

upon their Stalks may do, if you think it worth while; but Orange-Flower-Leaves do very well. It is a 

fine Candy to carry in the Pocket.  Then to begin your Business. Take one Pound of double-

refined Loaf-Sugar beat small, and finely sifted; mix this with four or five spoonfuls of Orange-

Flower-Water, and about half a Drachm of Gum-Arabic finely beaten; then put three spoonfuls of 

White Wine, and mix all together, and boil them in a glazed earthen Vessel till the Liquor will 

hardly run, or at least run in Ropes; then have small Jars of earthen Ware glazed, and put into 

each of them the several sorts of Fruits, and Flowers, you would inclose in candy'd Sugar, making 

those Jars very hot, and immediately pour the Liquor upon them, and stop them close; then put 



the Jars into a Stove, for a fortnight or more, and you may then break the Jars, and your several 

Fruits and Flowers will be inclosed in a crystal like Candy, such as white Sugar Candy. And then 

with a slight blow of an Hammer, break these Candies into Pieces of about a Finger's length, and 

keep them in Glasses stopt close, in a dry Place, and they will remain good several Years. The 

little Pots must be broken of course.    To make a _Hackin._ From a Gentleman in _Cumberland._ 

Sir,  There are some Counties in _England_, whose Customs are never to be set aside; and our 

Friends in _Cumberland_, as well as some of our Neighbours in _Lancashire_, and else-where, 

keep them up. It is a Custom with us every _Christmas_-Day in the Morning, to have, what we call 

an Hackin, for the Breakfast of the young Men who work about our House; and if this Dish is not 

dressed by that time it is Day-light, the Maid is led through the

Rellstab, died at her home in Trenton. She had been an invalid for many years. Before her 

marriage, in 1905, she was Miss Mary Johnston Whittaker, daughter of the late George R. and 

Mrs. Mary Whittaker. Besides her husband, two sisters, Mrs. J. F. Clement of Philadelphia and 

Miss Emily Whittaker of Trenton, survive. Mrs. Rellstab was for many years active in church and 

charity work.  On Nov. 25 the Supreme Court suspended three lawyers charged with 

unprofessional conduct: Mr. William M. Rysdyk, of Jersey City, for one year; Mr. Charles Sloff, of 

Passaic, for one year, and Mr. Charles K. Richmond, of Passaic, for two years. In the first two 

cases the cause was financial misappropriation, and in the last case an endeavor to influence a 

juryman.                         NEW JERSEY BAR EXAMINATIONS,                           NOVEMBER 

TERM, 1921.                            ATTORNEY'S QUESTIONS.  1. A party in a proceeding in the 

Orphans' Court appealed from the decree of said Court to the Court of Errors and Appeals. Was 

this proper?  2. A held in trust for F certain lands and also certain bonds. He died intestate, leaving 

two sons B and C, B being the elder. C was appointed administrator. To whom did the title to the 

land and to whom do the bonds descend?  3. W being under indictment by a Federal Grand Jury, 

applied to the Court for compulsory process for the purpose of obtaining witnesses in his behalf. 

His application was denied. Was the Court right?  4. A railroad company made a mortgage upon 

its lands, chattels and franchises. It was duly recorded as a real estate mortgage but it was not 

recorded as a chattel mortgage. Was it valid as to the chattels against creditors of the company? 

5. S went to work for B and took two flags with him. He allowed B to use one of them and helped 



put it on B's building. Subsequently a hail storm destroyed it. He then sued B for the value of the 

flag. Should he recover?  6. G agreed to sell and deliver to J certain goods on or before the 15th of 

July. Instead of delivering the whole of the goods he attempted to deliver the same in instalments, 

the last instalment to be delivered on July 15. J refused to accept the goods. Was he bound to do 

so?  7. Where there is a plain repugnancy between the provisions of an original contract, and 

those of a supplemental one between the same parties relating to the same subject matter, which 

one controls?  8. S, being indebted to a number of persons, advertised and sold at public sale all 

of his stock to one person. Was this contrary to the Bulk Sales Act of 1915?  9. One member of 

the firm of W & Co. which was still in existence, without the authority of the other member, 

confessed a judgment to Y, a creditor of the firm. Was the judgment binding upon the firm?  10. An 

agent acting within the scope of his authority, did certain fraudulent acts. Was the principal liable 

for these acts of the agent?  11. What are the requirements to make an instrument negotiable? 

12. John Smith made a will, wherein he gave his son, Thomas, a legacy of $5,000, adding that the 

legacy should be void if Thomas married any one of the daughters of Robert Jones. Thomas 

having married one of Jones' daughters, demanded the legacy, claiming that the condition was 

void. Was his claim good?  13. (a) How soon after the death of a testator may his will be admitted 

to probate? (b) How soon after the death of an intestate may administration of his estate be 

granted?  14. What is the difference between the between two Men, as fast as they can run with 

her, up Hill and down Hill, which she accounts a great shame. But as for the Receipt to make this 

Hackin, which is admired so much by us, it is as follows.  Take the Bag or Paunch of a Calf, and 

wash it, and clean it well with Water and Salt; then take some Beef-Suet, and shred it small, and 

shred some Apples, after they are pared and cored, very small. Then put in some Sugar, and 

some Spice beaten small, a little Lemon-Peel cut very fine, and a little Salt, and a good quantity of 

Grots, or whole Oat-meal, steep'd a Night in Milk; then mix these all together, and add as many 

Currans pick'd clean from the Stalks, and rubb'd in a coarse Cloth; but let them not be wash'd. And 

when you have all ready, mix them together, and put them into the Calf's-Bag, and tye them up, 

and boil them till they are enough. You may, if you will, mix up with the whole, some Eggs beaten, 

which will help to bind it. This is our Custom to have ready, at the opening of the Doors, on 

_Christmas_-Day in the Morning. It is esteem'd here; but all that I can say to you of it, is, that it 

eats somewhat like a _Christmas_-Pye, or is somewhat like that boil'd. I had forgot to say, that 

with the rest of the Ingredients, there should be some Lean of tender Beef minced small.    The 

_Northampton-Cake._  Take a Peck of Flour, and a Pound of fine Sugar beaten well into Powder, 

and sifted; then add a quarter of an Ounce of Cloves, half an Ounce of Cinnamon, and a large 

Nutmeg, and beat them to powder; put to this some Orange-Flower-Water, or Rose-Water; then 

take five or six Pounds of Currans well pick'd, and rub'd dry with a coarse Cloth, but not wash'd. 

Put these with your Fruit, and a little Salt into the Flour; then take as much Cream as you think 

proper: then melt two Pounds of Butter, to mix with it, and add a Pint of Canary-Wine, and kneed it 

with some fresh Ale-Yeast, till it rises under your hand. Have your Oven hot before you put it in the 

Hoop for Baking.    Of the Baking of Fruit. From Mr. _L. M._  It is to be observed, that all Fruits that 

are ripe require little baking, and those which are of the hardest, or most unripe Sorts, ought to 

have a long and gentle baking. In Pears, for example, when we have some of those, which ripen in 

the Autumn, they will bake with a Tart; for as they are ripe of themselves, they require very little 



baking, for Ripeness is one degree tending to Rottenness; and as that is done by heat gently, so 

the Oven brings that to a certain height, suddenly, with its safeguard of Sugar; that the Fruit comes 

to its full flavour, with the additional beauty, from the Sugar. It would have done a great deal by 

Nature itself, if the Tree had stood in a place agreeable; but much more would it be for those 

baking Pears, as we call them, if they had the advantage of a good Climate; one may guess then 

how much difference there is between one and the other. In the tough and hard Pears, one ought 

to bake them twice, that is, once with a little Water and Sugar, in as hot an Oven as they bake 

Bread in; and then put them in Pyes, and bake them over again, so will they become tender, well 

tasted, and of a fine colour. But be it as it will, as soon as either of these come out of the Oven, 

pour some Cream over them, and mix it with them, if they are to be served hot, mashing the Fruit 

all the while; but if they are to be served cold, then only pour some Cream over them, when they 

just come from the Oven, and let it remain till you serve it cold.  There is one way which is 

practised by some, and that is, to break the hard Pears, just when they are taken out of the Oven, 

in the Pye; for else the outsides, though the Rind is off, will be hard, and tough: then pour on the 

Cream. It is to be noted, that all ripe Apples require less baking, and less Sugar, than the hard 

Apples, which do not become ripe till some Months afterwards. When an Apple, or Pear, for 

example, is as ripe as it can be in our Climate, it will have some softness, and some sweetness in 

it, and therefore will require less baking, as baking is only a sort of ripening; and so on the other 

hand: but we are providentially provided with both Apples and Pears, which are, some ripe sooner, 

and some ripe later; even that by the end of _July,_ we have some ripe, and some remain hard 

and sour till _June._ We ought be apprised of the Sorts, to take them in their several Seasons, 

and not to take the Winter Fruits, for baking, when we have ripe Fruits by us. Many thousand 

Bushels of Fruit are lost for want of this Caution.  So at any time, when you use Apples, or Pears, 

for Tarts, Puddings, or Sauces, let them be all of one Sort, and ripe; for, if they are ripe, or towards 

it, they will soon soften; and if you put two Sorts together, one will be in Pulp very soon, and the 

other will be hard for an Hour or two, and at length will not be soft. _Memorandum,_ This is not to 

be disregarded.    To make Paste. From Mrs. _Peasly._  There are many sorts of Paste made, and 

among them, are some which are made with Eggs, according to the old fashion; but these are 

always hard, when they are baked, though they will fly and crackle in the Mouth, but they taste like 

Sticks: while, on the other side, leave out your Eggs, and use Butter and Water only, as in the 

following Receipts, and your Paste will melt in the Mouth, and be agreeable to the Taste.  If you 

would have a sweet Paste; then take half a Pound of Butter, and rub it into about a Pound of Flour, 

with two or three Ounces of double-refined Sugar powder'd, and make it a Paste, with cold Milk, 

some Sack and Brandy. This is a very good one.  You may also make an hot Paste, for minced 

Pyes, or such like, by taking a quantity of Flour as you like, and break a Pound or two of Butter 

into a large Sauce-pan of Water; and when 


_
of mutual mistake and of the mistake of one party?  15. A made a conveyance of real estate to B 

for the purpose of defrauding his creditors. A having died intestate, his heirs brought suit in 

Chancery to compel B to convey the property to them. What should the Court do?  16. B made a 

will leaving all his property to D, whom his (B's) mistress had fraudulently represented to him to be 

his child. C, the heir at law of B, filed a bill in Chancery to set aside the will on the ground the midst 

of the Flour, and scumming off the Butter, throw it, at times, into the Flour, with some of the boiling 

hot Water along with it; then, when you have enough for your use, work it into a stiff Paste, and lay 

it before the Fire, cover'd with a Cloth, and cut off such bits as you want, just when you are going 

to use them. This Paste does very well for raised Pyes. Some will make this Paste by breaking in 

a Pound of Butter into a quarter of a Peck of Flour, and then pouring 


_
fraud. D moves to strike out. What should the Court do?  17. B sued A for slander. A pleaded that 

he was intoxicated at the time he uttered the slander. B moved to strike out this defence. What 

should the Court do?  18. A sued the City of N for damages. He showed that he had been run over 

by an ash-cart owned and operated by the City by reason of the driver's negligence and that the 

driver was drunk at the time and was drunk to the knowledge of the City's foreman when the latter 

sent him out with the cart. The City moved to nonsuit. Should the motion be granted?  19. A sued 

B for damages by reason of injuries caused by the joint negligence of B and C. He recovered a 

judgment which B paid. B then sued C for contribution. Could he recover?  20. A was indicted for 

murder of B. On the trial it was shown that A killed B while B was trying to rob him on the enough 

to work it to a stiff Paste. As for Tarts, one may make the following Puff-Paste. Rub in some Butter 

into your Flour, and make it into a Paste with Water, and when it is moulded, roll it out till it is about 

half an Inch thick; then put bits of Butter upon it, about half an Inch asunder, and fold your Paste 

together, and then fold it again: then roll it again till it becomes of the thickness it was before; and 

then lay bits of Butter on it, as before directed, and fold it as mention'd above, and roll it again to 

the thickness of half an Inch; then put on the rest of your Butter, and fold it up, and roll it for the 

last time, doubling it, and rolling it twice, before you use it. This is very good for Puffs, Puddings, or 

Petty-Patees.  As for Meat-Pyes, or Pasties, they require another sort of Paste, which is made 

thus. Rub seven Pounds of Butter 


_
contended that A could not be acquitted unless it appeared that he could not have rendered the 

attempt to rob abortive by any means less radical. The Court overruled this contention. Was the 

ruling correct?  21. A husband decided to move from New Jersey to New York. His wife refused to 

go with him and filed a bill for small; then make it into a Paste with Water. It is good for Venison-

Pasties, and such like great Pyes.    To dress a Dish of Fish in the best manner. From the same. 

To make one of these grand Dishes, you ought always to have some capital sort of Fish, for the 

middle of the Dish; such as a Turbut, a Jowl of fresh Salmon, a
