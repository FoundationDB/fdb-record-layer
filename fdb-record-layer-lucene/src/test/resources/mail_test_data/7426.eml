Some fifteen years ago, on the occasion of an exhibition in Paris of Miss C=
assatt's work a French=20

critic suggested that she was then, perhaps, with the exception of Whistler=
, "the only artist of an=20

elevated, personal and distinguished talent actually possessed by America."=
 The suggestion no=20

doubt was a rash one, since, as much personal and distinguished work by Ame=
rican artists never=20

leaves this country, the data for comparison must be lacking to a French cr=
itic; but it is certainly=20

true that, like Whistler, Miss Cassatt early struck an individual note, loo=
ked at life with her own=20

eyes, and respected her intellectual instrument sufficiently to master it t=
o the extent, at least, of=20

creating a style for herself. Born at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, she studied=
 first at the Philadelphia=20

Academy, and later traveled through Spain, Italy, and Holland in search of =
artistic knowledge and=20

direction. In France she came to know the group of painters including Monet=
, Renoir, Pissarro and=20

Degas, and especially influenced by the work of Degas, she turned to him fo=
r the counsel she=20

needed, receiving it in generous measure. It was a fortunate choice, the mo=
st fortunate the battle.]=20

There are but a few parallel cases to this, of a commander leaving one ship=
 and transferring his=20

flag to another in the heat of action.  The Duke of York upon one occasion =
shifted his flag, in the=20

battle of Solebay; and in the battle of Texel, fought on August 11, 1673, t=
he English Admiral=20

Sprague shifted his flag from the _Royal Prince_ to the _St. George_; and t=
he Dutch Admiral Van=20

Tromp shifted his flag from the _Golden Lion_ to the _Comet_, owing to the =
former vessel being=20

practically destroyed by a concentrated fire. This does not detract from th=
e gallantry of Perry=E2=80=99s=20

achievement. The danger he faced was great, and he was probably closer to t=
he enemy=E2=80=99s vessels=20

than any of the commanders above mentioned.  [Illustration: THE FIRST POSIT=
ION IN THE=20

BATTLE]  Perry=E2=80=99s younger brother, who was but a midshipman, was one=
 of the seven other men in=20

the boat. They left on board the _Lawrence_ not above a half-score of able-=
bodied men to look=20

after the numerous wounded. Owing to the opinions of many of the contempora=
ry writers, who=20

gave way to an intense feeling of partisanship, some bitterness was occasio=
ned and sides were=20

taken in regard to the=20

pursuit of all the subtlety, eloquence and precision possible to pure line.=
 The fruit of his influence is=20

to be found in the technical excellence of her representations of life, the=
 firmness and candor of=20

her drawing, her competent management of planes and surfaces, and the audac=

superior officer; but, looking back at it from this day, we can see little =
reason for any feeling of=20

jealousy. It is hard to point the finger at any one on the American side in=
 this action and say that=20

he did not do his duty. As Perry reached the side of the _Niagara_ the wind=
