  "No thankee, lass; I _
except, upon one occasion, those of a few giraffes. I had been told that th=

rich in game, but, at this season, it was swarming with Arabs, and was so m=

everything had left the country, and the elephants merely drank during the =
greatest service,=20

because it not only prevents them from being harassed, the engines from bei=

tant nightingale, as upon=20

the Settite river, was now an uncommon sound. The maneless lion is found on=
 the banks of the=20

Dinder; all that I saw, in the shape of game, in the neighbourhood of that =
river and the Rahad,=20

were a few hippopotami and crocodiles. The stream of the Dinder is obstruct=
ed with many snags=20

and trunks of fallen trees that would be serious obstacles to rapid navigat=
ion: these are the large=20

stems of the soont (Acacia Arabica), that, growing close to the edge, have =
fallen into the river=20

when the banks have given way. I was astonished at the absence of elephants=
 in such favourable=20

ground; for some miles I walked along the margin of the river without seein=
g a track of any date.=20

 reduced. Even in the=20

more, gave another expostulatory grunt, and drew his blanket over him; whil=
e Joe Dashwood went=20

home.  Joe's home consisted of a small apartment round the corner of the st=
reet, within a few=20

seconds' run of the station.  Off the small apartment there was a large clo=
set.  The small=20

apartment was Dashwood's drawing-room, dining-room, and kitchen; the large =
closet was his bed-

room.  Dashwood had a wife, "as tight a little craft, with as pretty a figu=
rehead," he was wont to=20

say, "as you could find in a day's walk through London."  That was saying a=
 good deal, but there=20

was some truth in it.  When Joe entered, intending to go to bed for the nig=
ht, he found that Mary=20

had just got up for the day.  It was "washing-day," or something of that so=
rt, with Mary, which=20

accounted for her getting up at about three in the morning.  "Hallo, lass, =

ad of forty or fifty,=20

which was the largest number that I had seen together. The habits of all an=

upon the nature of the localities they inhabit. Thus, as these countries we=

cing at a crib where little=20
