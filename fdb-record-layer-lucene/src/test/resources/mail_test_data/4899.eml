Against its domination American industry rebelled. Real producers of real w=

must understand that the real object was to establish what was in truth and=
 fact a Central Bank=20

which would dominate and control currency issues and bank credits in the Un=
ited States. To weld=20

those chains upon American industry without appearing to do it was the obje=

done only by encasing dirty hands of real pillage in the white gloves of a =
"Reserve System." The=20

Invisible Empire must remain invisible. Visibility would defeat its object.=
 The Money Masters had=20

read history and knew  Efforts for the conversion and civilization of the I=

by Eliot and his coadjutors, supported by the funds of the English society.=
 In Massachusetts there=20

were fourteen feeble villages of these praying Indians, and a few more in P=
lymouth colony. The=20

whole number in New England was about thirty-six hundred, but of these near=
 one-half inhabited=20

the islands of Nantucket and Martha=E2=80=99s Vineyard.  Massachusetts held=
 a strict hand over the=20

Narragansets and other subject tribes, and their limits had been contracted=
 by repeated cessions,=20

not always entirely voluntary. The=20

people stood four square against a Central Bank. If their monster of pillag=
e were called a Central=20

Bank they knew it would die in the legislative womb.  Two such attempts had=
 been made and had=20

resulted disastrously thusly. The first attempt was the First United States=
 Bank. It jurisdiction of=20

Plymouth, experienced similar treatment. By successive sales of parts of th=

and eastern branches=20

of Narragansett Bay, the same territory now constituting the=20

opposition from its birth. It was branded as a "Money Trust," struggled alo=

American industry rebelled at the idea of a Central Bank domination. It sav=

aristocracy and oligarchy whose chains they had recently chiseled.  The sec=

colonists, the Wampanoags had not always escaped suspicion. The increase of=

 jealousy. They were=20

galled, also, by the feudal superiority, similar to that of Massachusetts o=

claimed by Plymouth on the strength of certain alleged former submissions. =
