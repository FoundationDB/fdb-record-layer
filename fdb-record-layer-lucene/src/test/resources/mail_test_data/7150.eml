physician, and we congratulated ourselves upon the healthiness of our littl=
e isolated camp, when=20

suddenly my wife was prostrated by a severe attack of gastric fever, which =
for nine days rendered=20

her recovery almost hopeless. At length the fever gave way to careful atten=
dance, and my Arab=20

patients and Florian were also in a fair way towards recovery. The plagues =
of Egypt were upon us;=20

the common house-flies were in billions, in addition to the cattle-tormento=
r. Our donkeys would not=20

graze, but stood day and night in the dense smoke of fires, made of sticks =
and green grass, for=20

protection.  The plague of boils broke out, and every one was attacked more=
 or less severely.=20

Then came a plague of which Moses must have been ignorant, or he would sure=
ly have inflicted it=20

upon Pharaoh. This was a species of the eve of some mighty change, but it w=
as then indefinite,=20

though to me inevitable. You were destined, I was persuaded, to witness it,=
 even, as I hoped, to=20

take no inconsiderable share in its fulfilment. But I hardly believed that =
I should have been spared=20

for this transcendent day, and, when it is consummated, I will gratefully e=
xclaim, =E2=80=98Nunc me=20

dimittis!=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou, allude, sir, to some important m=
atter which Lady St. Jerome a few days ago=20

intimated to me, but it was only an intimation, and purposely very vague.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere is no doubt,=E2=80=9D=20

said the cardinal, speaking with solemnity, =E2=80=9Cof what I now communic=
ate to you. The Holy Father,=20

Pius IX., has resolved to summon an Oecumenical Council.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CAn Oecumenical Council!=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair.  =E2=80=9CIt is a weak phrase,=E2=80=9D resumed the cardinal, =E2=
=80=9Cto say it will be the=20


_
equally; it attacked all parts of the body, but principally the extremities=
. The irritation was beyond=20

description; small vesicles rose above the skin, containing a watery fluid,=
 which, upon bursting,=20

appeared to spread the disease. The Arabs had no control over this malady, =
which they called=20

"coorash," and the whole country was scratching. The popular belief attribu=
ted the disease to the=20

water of the Atbara at this particular season: although a horrible plague, =
I do not believe it to have=20

any connexion with the well-known itch or "scabies" of Europe.  I adopted a=
 remedy that I had=20

found a specific for mange in dogs, and this treatment became equally succe=
ssful in cases of=20

coorash. Gunpowder, with the addition of one-fourth of sulphur, made into a=
 soft paste with water,=20

and then formed into an ointment with fat: this should be rubbed over the w=
hole body. The effect=20

upon a black man is that of a well-cleaned boot--upon a white man it is sti=
ll more striking; but it=20

quickly cures the malady. I went into half mourning by this process, and I =
should have adopted=20

deep mourning had it been necessary; I was only attacked from the feet to a=
 little above the knees.=20

Florian was in a dreadful state, and the vigorous and peculiar action of hi=
s arms at once explained=20

the origin of the term "Scotch fiddle," the musical instrument commonly att=
ributed to the north of=20

Great Britain.  The Arabs are wretchedly ignorant of the healing art, and t=
hey suffer accordingly. At=20

least fifty per cent. of the population in Sofi had a permanent enlargement=
 of the spleen, which=20

could be felt with a slight pressure of the hand, frequently as large as an=
 orange; this was called=20

"Jenna el Wirde" (child of the fever), and was the result of constant attac=
ks of fever in successive=20

rainy seasons.  Faith is the drug that is supposed to cure the Arab; since =
the Episcopate of St.=20

Peter; greater, in its consequences to the human race, than the fall of the=
 Roman Empire, the=20

pseudo-Reformation, or the Revolution of France. It is much more than three=
 hundred years since=20

the last Oecumenical Council, the Council of Trent, and the world still vib=
rates with its decisions.=20

But the Council of Trent, compared with the impending Council of the Vatica=
n, will be as the=20

mediaeval world of Europe compared with the vast and complete globe which m=
an has since=20

discovered and mastered.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIndeed!=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =
 =E2=80=9CWhy, the very assembly of the Fathers of the=20

Church will astound the Freemasons, and the secret societies, and the athei=
sts. That alone will be=20

a demonstration of power on the part of the Holy Father which no conqueror =
from Sesostris to=20

Napoleon has ever equalled. It was only the bishops of Europe that assemble=
d at Trent, and,=20

inspired by the Holy Spirit, their decisions have governed man for more tha=
n three hundred years.=20

But now the bishops of the whole world will assemble round the chair of St.=
 Peter, and prove by=20

their presence the catholic character of the Church. Asia will send its pat=
riarchs and pontiffs, and=20

America and Australia its prelates; and at home, my dear young friend, the =
Council of the Vatican=20

will offer a striking contrast to the Council of Trent; Great Britain will =
be powerfully represented.=20

The bishops of Ireland might have been counted on, but it is England also t=
hat will send her=20

prelates now, and some of them will take no ordinary share in transactions =
that will give a new=20

form and color to human existence.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIs it true, sir, that=
 the object of the council is to declare the=20

infallibility of the pope?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIn matters of faith and moral=
s,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal quickly. =E2=80=9CThere is no=20

other infallibility. That is a secret with God. All that we can know=20


_
complaint may be, he applies to his Faky or priest. This minister is not tr=
oubled with a confusion of=20

book-learning, neither are the shelves of his library bending beneath weigh=
ty treatises upon the=20

various maladies of human nature; but he possesses the key to all learning,=
 the talisman that will=20

apply to all cases, in that one holy book the Koran. This is his complete p=
harmacopoeia: his=20

medicine chest, combining purgatives, blisters, sudorifics, styptics, narco=
tics, emetics, and all that=20

the of the decision of the council on this awful head is, that its decision=
, inspired by the Holy Spirit,=20

must infallibly be right. We must await that decision, and, when made known=
, we must embrace it,=20

not only with obedience, but with the interior assent of mind and will. But=
 there are other results of=20

the council on which we may speculate; and which, I believe, it will certai=
nly accomplish: first, it will=20

show in a manner that cannot be mistaken that there is only one alternative=
 for the human=20


_
could prescribe. With this "multum in parvo" stock-in-trade the Faky receiv=
es his patients. No. 1=20

arrives, a barren woman who requests some medicine that will promote the bl=
essing of childbirth.=20

No. 2, a man who was strong in his youth, but from excessive dissipation ha=
s become useless.=20

No. 3, a man deformed from his birth, who wishes to become straight as othe=
r men. No. 4, a blind=20

child. No. 5, a dying intellect: Rationalism or Faith; and, secondly, it wi=
ll exhibit to the Christian=20

powers the inevitable future they are now preparing for themselves.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CI am among the faithful,=E2=80=9D=20

said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CThen you must be a member of the Church Catholic,=
=E2=80=9D said the cardinal. =E2=80=9CThe basis=20

on which God has willed that His revelation should rest in the world is the=
 testimony of the Catholic=20

Church, which, if considered=20
