witnesses must be allowed to testify to opinions and conclusions.  Again, i=
n a like case, a body is=20

found bearing evidences of wounds or bruises. The question to be determined=
 is whether they=20

were inflicted before or after death; if before death, whether they were su=
fficient to cause death.=20

Some wounds and injuries might be sufficiently apparent and dangerous so th=
at the common,=20

inexperienced eye would at once detect that they were sufficient to cause d=
eath. But in most=20

instances this is not the case, and in such instances the testimony of expe=
rts is required by the=20

necessity of the case, to show that the wounds and injuries were sufficient=
 to cause death.  _The=20

General Rules Stated as to Subjects for Expert Testimony._=E2=80=94Hence th=
e general rule is, that=20

wherever the facts to be investigated are such that common experience and k=
nowledge of men do=20

not enable them to draw accurate conclusions, but are such that the study a=
nd experience of=20

specialists do enable such specially endowed persons to draw accurate concl=
usions, then the=20

inferences and deductions they have drawn can be testified to by those who =
qualify themselves=20

before the court as persons having sufficient skill and experience as such =
specialists to entitle=20

them to give opinions. The cases in which expert testimony is permitted to =
be given are set forth in=20

Rogers on Expert Testimony, Sec. 6, quoting from Jones _v._ Tucker (41 N. H=
., 546), as follows:=20

=E2=80=9C1. Upon questions of science, skill, or trade, or others of like k=
ind.  =E2=80=9C2. Where the subject-matter of=20

inquiry is such that inexperienced persons are unlikely to prove capable of=
 forming a correct=20

judgment without such assistance.  =E2=80=9C3. Where the subject-matter of =
investigation so far partakes of=20

the nature of science as to require a course or previous habit of study in =
order to the attainment of=20

knowledge of it.=E2=80=9D  So also Chief Justice Shaw of the Supreme Court =
of Massachusetts, in New=20

England Glass Co. _v._ Lovell (7 Cushing, 319), said:  =E2=80=9CIt is not b=
ecause a man has a reputation=20

for sagacity and judgment and power of reasoning that his opinion is admiss=
ible in testifying as a=20

witness. If so, such men might be called in all cases to advise the jury, a=
nd it would change the=20

mode of trial; but it is because a man=E2=80=99s professional pursuit, or h=
is peculiar skill and knowledge of=20



some department of science not common to men in general, enable him to draw=
 inferences where=20

men of common experience, after all the facts have been proved, would be le=
ft in doubt.=E2=80=9D  To the=20

same effect see Muldowney _v._ Illinois Central R. R. Co., 36 Iowa, 472; Wh=
arton on Evidence,=20

Sec. 436; Greenleaf on Evidence, Sec. 441.  _Qualifications of this General=
 Rule._=E2=80=94The extent to=20

which an expert witness can go in giving his opinion is limited to matters =
of science and skill, and=20

does not extend to the expression of views on matters of legal or moral obs=
ervation, or the manner=20

in which others would probably be influenced if the parties had acted in on=
e way rather than in=20

another. Campbell _v._ Richards, 5 B. & Ad., 345.  So it has been held that=
 the question whether a=20

physician has honorably and faithfully discharged his duty in a given case,=
 either to his medical=20

profession or to his patient, is not a question of science but of pure ethi=
cs, upon which the jury is=20

as competent to decide as any one else, and in such a case an opinion would=
 not be allowed to be=20

given either by another medical practitioner or by a professor in the scien=
ce of morals. Rogers on=20

Expert Testimony, Sec. 11, citing Ramadge _v._ Ryan, 9 Bing., 333.  There a=
re also some matters=20

of fact which apparently transcend the dividing line between common experie=
nce and judgment=20

and scientific experience and judgment, as to which expert testimony is not=
 receivable, but the jury=20

and court must weigh the facts and draw the inferences for themselves. An i=
nteresting example of=20

this is found in the case of Manke _v._ The People, 78 N. Y., 611 (17 Hun, =
410), cited in=20

Stephens=E2=80=99 =E2=80=9CDigest of the Law of Evidence,=E2=80=9D p. 107, =
note H, decided in the New York Court of=20

Appeals a few years ago. In that case one Adolf was killed by a gunshot, an=
d pieces of paper were=20

found near the scene of the homicide bearing certain marks. An expert was c=
alled upon to say=20

whether they were powder-marks, and whether the condition of the paper was =
such that in his=20

opinion it was wadding which had been fired from a gun. This evidence was h=
eld to be=20

inadmissible by the General Term of the Supreme Court, and this decision wa=
s affirmed by the=20

Court of Appeals. These courts held that the question as to whether this wa=
s a wad fired from a=20

gun was a matter which the jury was as competent to judge of as the witness=
. In delivering the=20

opinion at General Term, Presiding Justice Talcott said that this case was =
very close to the border=20

line, but in his judgment it was beyond the province of experts and within =
the province of jurors.=20

Nevertheless, in that case the evidence of chemists who had examined the wa=
dding, and had=20

discovered the marks on it which were said to be powder-marks, and upon ana=
lysis had=20

determined that they were powder-marks, or that they were marks of powder w=
hich had exploded,=20

would have been clearly admissible.  The subjects concerning which medical =
men may be called=20

upon to testify as experts are as numerous as the diseases, injuries, menta=
l and physical=20

conditions of the human race which fall within the range of the practice of=
 medicine and surgery. It=20

is therefore practically impossible to give them in detail.[185]  _Practica=
l Suggestions and=20

Admonitions Embodied in Rules._=E2=80=94It is deemed advisable that the fol=
lowing practical suggestions=20

and admonitions to physicians, concerning their duties as expert witnesses,=
 shall here be given.=20

First: A physician should refuse to testify as an expert unless he is consc=
ious that he is really=20

qualified as an expert.  Second: After accepting the responsibility, his fi=
