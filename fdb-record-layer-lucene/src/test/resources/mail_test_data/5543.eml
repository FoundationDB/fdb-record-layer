sobs of a man in the very agony of abasement; here we have the story of their blessed issue. 

There we had multiplied synonyms for sin, and for the forgiveness which was desired; here it is the 

many-sided preciousness of forgiveness possessed which runs over in various yet equivalent 

phrases. There the highest point to which he could climb was the assurance that a bruised heart 

was accepted, and the bones broken might still rejoice. Here the very first word is of blessedness, 

and the close summons the righteous to exuberant joy. The one is a psalm of wailing; the other, to 

use its own words, a "song of deliverance."  What glad consciousness that he himself is the happy 

man whom he describes rings in the melodious variations of the one thought of forgiveness in the 

opening words! How gratefully he draws on the treasures of that recent experience, while he sets 

it forth as being the "taking away" of sin, as if it were the removal of a solid something, or the lifting 

of a burden being what she is--that is, you understand," Lamps added, somewhat hurriedly, "not 

having a thousand pound in a box--they take thought for her.  And as concerning the young pairs, 

married and unmarried, it's only natural I should bring home what little I can about _them_, seeing 

that there's not a Couple of either sort in the neighbourhood that don't come of their own accord to 

confide in Phoebe."  She raised her eyes triumphantly to Barbox Brothers, as she said:  "Indeed, 

sir, that is true.  If I could have got up and gone to church, I don't know how often I should have 

been a bridesmaid.  But if I could have done that, some girls in love might have been jealous of 

me, and as it is, no girl is jealous of me.  And my pillow would not have been half as ready to put 

the piece of cake under, as I always find it," she added, turning her face on it with a light sigh, and 

a smile at her father.  The arrival of a little girl, the biggest of the scholars, now led to an 

understanding

"covering" of sin, as if it were the wrapping of its ugliness in thick folds that hide it for ever even 

from the all-seeing Eye; and as the "non-reckoning" of sin, as if it were the discharge of a debt! 

What vivid memory of past misery in the awful portrait of his impenitent self, already referred to--

on which the mind dwells in silence, while the musical accompaniment (as directed by the "selah") 

touches some plaintive minor or grating discord! How noble and eloquent the brief words (echo of 

the historical narrative) that tell the full and swift forgiveness that followed simple confession--and 

how effectively the music again comes in, prolonging the thought and rejoicing in the pardon! How 

sure he is that his experience is of priceless value to the world for all time, when he sees in his 

absolution a motive that will draw all the godly nearer to their Helper in heaven! How full his heart 

is of praise, that he cannot but go back again to his own story, and rejoice in God his hiding-place-

-whose past wondrous love assures him that in the future songs of deliverance will ring him round, 

and all his path be encompassed with music of praise.  So ends the more personal part of the 

psalm. A more didactic portion follows, the generalization of that. Possibly the voice which now 

speaks is a higher than David's. "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go. 

I of the cottage, and had come to take active measures in it, attended by a pail that might have 

extinguished her, and a broom three times her height.  He therefore rose to take his leave, and 

took it; saying that if Phoebe had no objection, he would come again.  He had muttered that he 

would come "in the course of his walks."  The course of his walks must have been highly 

favourable to his return, for he returned after an interval of a single day.  "You thought you would 

never see me any more, I suppose?" he said to Phoebe as he touched her hand, and sat down by 

her couch.  "Why should I think so!" was her surprised rejoinder.  "I took it for granted you would 

mistrust me."  "For granted, sir?  Have you been so much mistrusted?"  "I think I am justified in 

answering yes.  But I may have mistrusted too, on my part.  No matter just now.  We were 

speaking of the Junction last time.  I have passed hours there since the day before yesterday." 

"Are you now the gentleman for Somewhere?" she asked with a smile.  "Certainly for Somewhere; 

but I don't yet know Where.  You would never guess what I am travelling from.  Shall I tell you?  I 

am travelling from my birthday."  Her hands stopped in her work, and she looked at him with 

incredulous astonishment.  "Yes," said Barbox Brothers, not quite easy in his chair, "from my 

birthday.  I am, to myself, an unintelligible book with the 


_
sounds like words meant to be understood as spoken by him. They are the promise from heaven 

of a gentle teaching to the pardoned man, which will instruct by no severity, but by patient 

schooling; which will direct by no harsh authority, but by that loving glance that is enough for those 

who love, and is all chapters all torn out, and thrown away.  My childhood had no grace of 

childhood, my youth had no charm of youth, and what can be expected from such a lost 

beginning?"  His eyes meeting hers as they were addressed intently to him, something seemed to 

stir within his breast, whispering: "Was this bed a place for

other. Such gracious direction is not for the psalmist alone, but it needs a spirit in harmony with 

God to understand it. For others there can be nothing higher than mere force, the discipline of 

sorrow, the bridle in the hard mouth, the whip for the stiff back. The choice for all men is through 

penitence and forgiveness to rise to the true position of men, capable of receiving and obeying a 

spiritual guidance, which appeals to the heart, and gently subdues the will, or by stubborn 

impenitence to fall to the level of brutes, that can only be held in by a halter and driven by a lash. 

And because this is the alternative, therefore "Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; but he that 

trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about."  And then the psalm ends with a great cry of 

gladness, three times reiterated, like the voice of a herald on some festal day of a nation: "Rejoice 

in Jehovah! and leap for joy, O righteous! and gladly shout, all ye upright in heart!"  Such is the 

end of the sobs of the penitent.     XIV.--CHASTISEMENTS.   The chastisements, which were the 

natural fruits of David's sin, soon began to show themselves, though apparently ten years at least 

passed before Absalom's revolt, at which time he was probably a man of sixty. But these ten years 

were very weary and sad. There is no more joyous to take to, kindly?  O shame, shame!"  "It is a 

disease with me," said Barbox Brothers, checking himself, and making as though he had a 

difficulty in swallowing something, "to go wrong about that.  I don't know how I came to speak of 

that.  I hope it is because of an old misplaced confidence in one of your sex involving an old bitter 

treachery.  I don't know.  I am all wrong together."  Her hands quietly and slowly resumed their 

work.  Glancing at her, he saw that her eyes were thoughtfully following them.  "I am travelling 

from my birthday," he resumed, "because it has always been a dreary day to me.  My first free 

birthday coming round some five or six weeks hence, I am travelling to put its predecessors far 

behind me, and to try to crush the day--or, at all events, put it out of my sight--by heaping new 

objects on it."  As he paused, she looked at him; but only shook her head as being quite at a loss. 

"This is unintelligible to your happy disposition," he pursued, abiding by his former phrase as if 

there were some lingering virtue of self-defence in it: "I knew it would be, and am glad it is. 

However, on this travel of mine (in which I mean to pass the rest of my days, having abandoned all 

thought of a fixed home), I stopped, as you heard from your father, at the Junction here.  The 

extent of its 


_
people's love. Disasters thicken round him, and may all be traced to his great sin. His children 

learned the lesson it had taught them, and lust and fratricide desolated his family. A parent can 

have no sharper pang than the sight of his own sins reappearing in his child. David saw the 

ghastly reflection of his unbridled passion in his eldest son's foul crime (and even a gleam of it in 

his unhappy daughter), and of his murderous craft in his second son's bloody revenge. Whilst all 

this hell of crime is boiling round him, a strange passiveness seems to have crept over the king, 

and to have confused me as to whither I should go, _from_ here.  I have not yet settled, being still 

perplexed among so many roads.  What do you think I mean to do?  How many of the branching 

roads can you see from your window?"  Looking out, full of interest, she answered, "Seven." 

"Seven," said Barbox Brothers, watching her with a grave smile.  "Well! I propose to myself, at 

once to reduce the gross number to those very seven, and gradually to fine them down to one--the 

most promising for me--and to take that."  "But how will you know, sir, which is the most 

promising?" she asked, with her brightened eyes
