he earliest example is a small painting of a boy's head supposed to be a po=
rtrait of the artist at the age of twenty or one and twenty; Dr. Bode consi=

without fires. At three in the morning (August 20th) the word was passed to=
 march. Such pitchy darkness covered the face of the plain that Smith order=

his execution. It is still more remarkable that in spite of his reactionary=
 tendencies, his archaistic=20

use of gold and relief at a moment when all great artists were renouncing t=
hese, he is intensely=20

modern in his sentiment. He seems to represent a phase of human development=
 at which we in=20

America have but recently arrived; a phase in which appreciation of ancient=
 finished forms of=20

beauty is united to a restless eagerness and the impulse toward exaggerated=
 self-expression. He=20

 and opened fire on the=20

Mexican camp.  At the same time, General Persifer Smith conceived the plan =
of turning Valencia=E2=80=99s=20

left, and hastened along the path through the Pedregal in the direction of =
a village called San=20

Jeronimo. Colonel Riley followed. Pillow sent Cadwalader=E2=80=99s brigade =
on the same line, and later in=20

the day Morgan=E2=80=99s regiment was likewise despatched toward that point=
. They drove in the Mexican=20
