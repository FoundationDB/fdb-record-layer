face with her hands.  Not at all long was Jasmine's prayer, but somehow it was very fervent, and it 

certainly reached a Presence which gives strength and peace. She was no longer oppressed by 

St. Paul's--she was comforted and strengthened.  "I do hope God will help us," she said to herself. 

"Oh! was it very, very rash of us to come up  "Maybe Dad wants me to repeat some verses to you. 

Used to do it and get patted on the head."  Mr. McGowan laughed heartily, but the Elder showed 

his displeasure.  "That will do, Harold," he commanded sternly. "I shall not allow profane jesting 

about sacred things in my house."  "Closet next, is it? Never mind, Dad, I'll try not to shock

the cathedral, hoping to see her party--they were, of course, nowhere within sight, and the little girl
