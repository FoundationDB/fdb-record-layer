with two followers, raised his voice in a battle yell, and rushed.  A figure had come forward to the 

open hatch, slender and topped with tawny curls. It paused and shrank back at the sudden 

apparition of Parr and his men leaping forward. Tentacles swarmed out, trying to push or pull the 

figure aside so as to close the hatch again. That took more seconds--then Parr had crossed the 

intervening space. Without even looking at the newcoming exile who had so providentially 

forestalled the closing of the hatch, he clutched a shoulder and heaved mightily. The Martian 

whose tentacles had reached from within came floundering out, dragged along--it was the skipper 

whose ironic acquaintance Parr had made in his own voyage out, all Aughanish. To carry on the 

work you took in hand last night.  MARTIN. What work did I take in hand last night? Oh, yes, I 

remember ... some big house ... we burned it down.... But I had not understood the vision when I 

did that. I had not heard the command right. That was not the work I was sent to do.  PAUDEEN. 

Rise up now and bid us what to do. Your great name itself will clear the road before you. It is you 

yourself will have freed all Ireland before the stooks will be in stacks!  MARTIN. Listen, I will 

explain ... I have misled you. It is only now I have the whole vision plain. As I lay there I saw 

through everything, I know all. It was but a frenzy, that going out to burn and to destroy. What 

have I to do with the

wrenched a pistol from a tentacle. Yelling again, he fired through the open hatchway. Two space-

hands ducked out of sight.  "We've won!" yelled Parr, and for a moment he thought they had. But 

not all his followers had charged with his own bold immediacy.  Sadau on one side of the ship, 

Jeffords and Haldocott at the other, had run in close and were walloping manfully at the nozzles of 

the rocket tubes. The outer metal yielded under the blows, threatening to clog the throats of the 

blasts. Only at the rear was there no attack--Shanklin, and with him three or four of the lesser 

men, had hung back. The few moments' delay there was enough to make all the difference. 

Thinking and acting wisely, even without a leader, the Martian space-hands met the emergency. 

They had withdrawn from the open hatchway, but could reach the mechanism that wild heart of 

time. My business is not reformation but revelation.  JOHNNY B. If you are going to turn back now 

from leading us, you are no better than any other traitor that ever gave up the work he took in 

hand. Let you come and face now the two hundred men you brought out, daring the power of the 

law last night, and give them your reason for failing them.  MARTIN. I was mistaken when I set out 

to destroy church and law. The battle we have to fight is fought out in our own minds. There is a 

fiery moment, perhaps once in a lifetime, and in that moment we see the only thing that matters. It 

is in that moment the great battles are lost and won, for in that moment we are a part of the host of 

heaven.  PAUDEEN. Have you betrayed us to the naked hangman with your promises and with 

your drink? If you brought us out here to fail us and to

late to jump in after them. Then one of them fired the undamaged rear tubes.  _Swish! Whang!_ 

The ship took off so abruptly that Parr barely dodged aside in time, dragging along with him the 

new Terrestrial whose shoulder he clutched, and also the surprised Martian skipper. The rocket 

blasts, dragging fiery fingers across the plain, struck down Haldocott and Jeffords, and bowled 

over two of  JOHNNY B. The curse of my heart on you! It would be right to send you to your own 

place on the flagstone of the traitors in hell. When once I have made an end of you, I will be as 

well satisfied to be going to my death for it as if I was going home!  MARTIN. Father John, Father 

John, can you not hear? Can you not see? Are you blind? Are you deaf?  FATHER JOHN. What is 

it? What is it?
