which light up No Man's Land. The enemy has a very good kind which remains =
alight for several=20

minutes.  Our days of comfortable billets are over, I am afraid. Unless you=
 are working hard, it is=20

miserable here,--wrecked towns, bad roads, shell holes, smells, dirt, soldi=
ers, horses, trenches.=20

The inhabitants are a poor, wretched lot. Many of them are thieves and spie=
s. We are right in=20

Belgium, where flies and smells are as varied as in the Orient.  Wherever w=
e travel by day or night=20

we are constantly challenged by sentries and have to produce our passes. We=

No pleasant variety of=20

hill and dale, no rapidly running brook delights the eye, and no sound of w=
oodland music strikes=20

the ear; but, in their stead, a dull uniformity of prospect "spread out imm=
ense." Excepting here and=20

there a tree, or a slight elevation of ground, it is otherwise a dead level=
, covered with tall weeds=20

and coarse grass. The sluggish rivulets, of a reddish colour, scarcely move=
 perceptibly, and their=20

appearance is as uninviting to the eye, as their taste is disgusting to the=
 palate. Such=20


_
than you can get at many places farther back. We talked to the woman who ke=
pt it and asked her=20

if she slept in the cellar. "Oh, no! I sleep upstairs, they never bombard e=
xcept at three in the=20

morning or nine at night. Then I go into the cellar." This woman was a very=
 pleasant, intelligent=20

person, most probably a spy. Intelligent people generally leave the danger =
zone.  Marching=20

through the sloughed-up mud, through shell holes filled with putrid water, =
amongst most=20

depressing conditions, I saw a working party returning to their billets. Th=
ey were wet through and=20

wrapped up with scarves, wool helmets, and gloves. Over their clothes was a=
 veneer of plastered=20

to one hundred bushels of maize or Indian corn to the acre, without ever ho=

States own thousands and thousands of acres of such land in these western S=
tates and territories,=20

which, for prompt payment, may be purchased for one dollar and sixty-two an=

is, that they=20

They looked exactly what they said they were.  Windmills, of which there ar=

 way as in semaphore;=20

_Dear Sir_,  In compliance with your request, that I would send you some ac=
count of the Virginia=20

 R. W. Withers, and I will=20

asked for a "fag." He died that night.                    -----------------=
--------------------  We had a terrific=20

bombardment last night; the ground shook all night and the sky was lit up f=
or miles. The Boches=20

used liquid fire on some new troops and we lost ground.  I found this piece=
 of poetry on the wall of=20

a smashed-up chateau, and I have copied it exactly as I found it. The writi=
ng was on a darkened=20

wall, and while I copied it my guide held a torchlight up to it. The place =
situated in the county of=20

Chesterfield, about 14 miles distant, in a direction W. S. W. from Richmond=
, and 3 miles south of=20

James' River. The country rises gradually from Richmond to the pits; and, f=
rom its sandy=20

appearance, is evidently an alluvial deposit, although its substratum is th=
e granite mentioned by=20

Mr. M'Clure, as extending through this state from S. S. W. to N. N. E. The =
coal is found on the=20
