possession, he said_, O my Lord, Thou hast given me dominion, and taught me the interpretation 

of events (_or dreams_): Creator of the heavens and the earth, Thou art my guardian in this world 

and in the world to come. Make me to die a Muslim, and join me with the righteous _among my 

forefathers. And he lived after that a week, or more, and died a hundred and twenty years old. And 

the Egyptians disputed concerning his burial: so they put him in a chest of marble, and buried him 

in the upper part of the Nile, that the blessing_ [resulting from him] _might be general to the tracts 

on each side of it.[247] Extolled be the perfection of Him to whose dominion there is no end!_ 

(xii. 54-102).     JOB.   And remember Our servant Job [Eiyoob[248]] when he called unto his Lord, 

Verily the devil hath afflicted me with calamity and pain. (_The affliction is attributed to the devil, 

though all was from God._) _And it was said unto him_, Strike _the earth_ with thy foot. _And he 

did so; whereupon a fountain of water sprang forth.[249] And it was said_, This _is_ cool _water 

for thee_ to wash with, and to drink. _So he washed himself and drank; and every disease that he 

had, external and internal, quitted him._ And We gave unto him his family, and as many more with 

them (_that is, God raised to life for him those of his children who had died, and blest him with as 

many more_),[250] in Our mercy and as an admonition unto those who are endowed with faculties 

of understanding. [And We said unto him,] Take in thy hand a handful _of dry grass, or of 

twigs_,[251] and strike with it _thy wife_ (_for he had sworn that he would inflict upon her a 

hundred blows, because she had staid away from him too long one day_[252]) and break not thine 

oath _by abstaining from striking her._--_So he took a hundred stalks of schoemanthus, or some 

other plant, and gave her one blow with them._ Verily We found him a patient person. How 

excellent a servant _was he_! For he was one who earnestly turned himself unto God.     (xxxviii. 

40-44.)     SHO'EYB.   And _we sent_ unto Midian [Medyen] their brother Sho'eyb.[253] He said, O 

my people, worship God; _assert His unity_. Ye have no other deity but Him. And give not short 

measure and weight. Verily I see you [to be] in a state of prosperity _that placeth you above the 

need of doing so_; and verily I fear for you, _if ye believe not_, the punishment of a day that will 

encompass _you with destruction_. And, O my people, give full measure and weight with equity; 

and diminish not unto men _aught_ of their things nor commit injustice in the earth, acting 

corruptly, _by murder or other offences_. The residue of God (_His supply that remaineth to you 

after the completion of the measure_) will be better for you _than diminution_, if ye be believers. 

And I am not a guardian over you, _to recompense you for your actions: I have only been sent as 

an admonisher_.--They replied, _in mockery_, O Sho'eyb, do thy prayers command thee that we 

are to leave what our fathers worshipped, or _cease_ to do with our riches what we please? Verily 

thou art the mild, the right director. _This they said in mockery._--He said, O my people, tell me, if I 

act according to an evident proof from my Lord, and He hath supplied me with a good _lawful_ 

provision, shall I mix it up with what is forbidden, and shall I not desire to oppose you, _and shall I 

betake myself_ to that which I forbid you? I desire not [aught] but _your_ reformation, as far as I 

am able [to effect it], and my help is not [in any] but in God: on Him do I rely, and unto Him do I 

turn me. And, O my people, let not the opposition of me procure for you the befalling you of the 

like of that which befell the people of Noah or the people of Hood or the people of Salih. And _the 

abodes of the_ people of Lot [are] not distant from you: (_or the time of their destruction was not 

long ago:_) _therefore be admonished_. And ask ye forgiveness of your Lord, and turn unto Him 



with repentance; for my Lord is merciful _to the believers_, loving _to them_. They replied, O 

Sho'eyb, we understand not much of what thou sayest, and verily we see thee to be weak[254] 

among us; and were it not for thy family, we had stoned thee; for thou art not, in our estimation, an 

honourable person: _thy family only are the honourable_. He said, O my people, are my family 

more honourable in your estimation than God, _and do ye abstain from slaying me for their sake, 

and not preserve me for God_, and have ye cast Him behind you as a thing neglected? Verily my 

Lord comprehendeth that which ye do, _and He will recompense you_. And, O my people, act ye 

according to your condition: verily I will act _according to mine_. Ye shall know on whom shall 

come a punishment that shall render him vile, and who is a liar: and await ye _the issue of your 

case_: verily I await with you.--And when Our degree _for their destruction_ came [to be 

executed], we delivered Sho'eyb and those who believed with him, in our mercy, and the cry _of 

Gabriel_ assailed those who had offended, so that in the morning they were in their abodes 

prostrate _and dead_, as though they had not dwelt therein. Was not Midian removed as 

Thamood had been removed?     (xi. 85-98.)     MOSES AND HIS PEOPLE.   We will rehearse 

unto thee, [O Mohammad, somewhat] of the history of Moses [Moosa] and Pharaoh [Fir'own or 

Far'oon],[255] with truth, for _the sake of_ people who believe. Verily Pharaoh exalted himself in 

the land _of Egypt_, and divided its inhabitants into parties _to serve him_. He rendered weak one 

class of them, _namely the children of Israel_, slaughtering their male children, and preserving 

alive their females, _because one of the diviners said unto him, A child will be born among the 

children of Israel, who will be the means of the loss of thy kingdom;_--for he was [one] of the 

corrupt doers. And We desired to be gracious unto those who had been deemed weak in the land, 

and to make them models of religion, and to make them the heirs _of the possessions of 

Pharaoh_, and to establish them in the land _of Egypt, and in Syria_, and to show Pharaoh and 

Haman[256] and their forces what they feared from them. And We said, by revelation, unto the 

mother of Moses, _the child above-mentioned, of whose birth none knew save his sister_, Suckle 

him; and when thou fearest for him cast him in the river _Nile_, and fear not _his being drowned_, 

nor mourn _for his separation_; for We will restore him unto thee, and will make him [one] of the 

apostles.[257] _So she suckled him three months, during which he wept not; and then she feared 

for him, wherefore she put him into an ark pitched within and furnished his courtiers called him, or 

Robert the Devil, as literature knows him, had an amour which is interesting as showing that class 

distinctions were not so rigid as one might think. According to Wace's story of the romance: 

"A Faleize ont li Dus hante,...         Une meschine i ont amee,         Arlot ont nom, de burgeis nee." 

(The duke did much frequent Falaise,... There he loved a girl named Arietta, born of a burgess of 

the town). Arietta, the tanner's daughter, was to become a figure of romance in the story of Robert 

the Devil; but, romance or no romance, she was the mother of the greatest of the Norman dukes, 

William the Conqueror, born in 1028. William had hard work to keep his place in Normandy, but 

we cannot stop to tell of the long and successful struggle which he waged against the haughty 

barons who refused to bow to the illegitimate son of the tanner's daughter. We all know the story 

of how the citizens of Alencon, which he was besieging, beat skins upon the walls of one of their 

redoubts, crying: "Work for the tanner!" and how William captured the redoubt, cut off the hands 

and feet of the unlucky jokers, and threw them over the town walls.  With a man of such temper, it 

is not unnatural that there should have arisen a curious story of his courtship, which began soon 



after this episode at Alencon. Engaged in constant conflict with his neighbors, William determined 

at least to secure the friendship of Flanders. He sought the hand of Matilda, daughter of Baldwin, 

Count of Flanders. Mauger, William's uncle, objected to the marriage, because Matilda and 

William were cousins, and caused the clergy to prohibit it. The Pope issued a special 

pronouncement against it. With him William could not proceed after the manner which doubtless 

most commended itself to him, but when the Italian Lanfranc, at the monastic school of Bee, dared 

to pronounce the marriage sinful, William promptly gave orders to burn down the farms from which 

the monks drew their sustenance, and to banish Lanfranc. But a shrewd display of courage and 

wit on Lanfranc's part made William his friend; and soon it was agreed that if William would found 

two monasteries the sin of his marriage would be forgiven him.  The chronicles of Tours report that 

Matilda herself objected to wedding the bastard of Normandy. The match, however, had been 

agreed to by her father, and William had set his heart on it. As proof of his determination, if not of 

his lover-like devotion, he waited for her as she came out of church one day, and whipped her till 

she consented to marry him! And as some writers assert, even after the marriage he continued to 

use this sort of suasion with his duchess, finally causing her death by his brutality. Despite this 

unlovely beginning, the marriage was a happy one. Matilda was beautiful, virtuous, and of strong 

character, so that she won her husband's confidence and love. In an age of scandalous marital 

infidelity, he was faithful to her. She was his faithful friend and counsellor through life; and when 

he went on that perilous voyage of adventure to win the English crown, it was she who was left in 

charge of the duchy of Normandy; she who was praying for her husband's safety in the priory she 

had founded at Rouen, when she heard the news of the great victory of Hastings, and christened 

the church Bonne Nouvelle; she who welcomed him back to his capital of Rouen after the success 

in England.  The purity and devotion of the Conqueror's queen present a picture very different 

from that of Bertrade de Montfort, who, like the wicked Constance, was connected with the house 

of Anjou. Philip I., a pitiable _roi faineant_, had married, in 1071, Bertha of Holland, by whom he 

had had three children. Having wearied of her, he sent her off to the chateau of Montreuil, 

prepared for her long before as a wedding bower, and then discovering one of those convenient 

relationships we have mentioned, succeeded in having his marriage annulled. Having thus 

relieved his conscience, it was but natural that he should begin to look about him--he may have 

looked before--for a wife whom he might keep for a while without distressing his conscience. He 

found this helpmeet in Bertrade de Montfort, with whom he fell in love while on a trip to Tours, in 

1092. It is true that "a good man could find naught to admire in her but her beauty," and that her 

husband, another Foulques of Anjou, was still living. But these are small matters when one is King 

of France and has one's heart set upon some particular lady. Foulques was not an attractive man; 

he seems to have had something like a club foot, and to have worn long, pointed shoes to hide his 

deformity; besides, he had already been twice divorced. Bertrade, young, beautiful, ambitious, was 

quite ready to go to the king and replace the unhappy Bertha. She eloped on the night following 

the king's visit to her husband, found an escort waiting for her at Meung-sur-Loire, and was 

conducted to Philip at Orleans.  Philip and Bertrade decided to get married, for the duchess was 

anxious to be called queen. They were indignant because most of the bishops suggested that the 

proceeding was rather irregular, since Foulques was not only still living but at that moment actually 

preparing to bring back his runaway spouse by force of arms. Nevertheless, by large gifts, the king 



persuaded one bishop to consecrate his union with Bertrade. Foulques and the friends of the 

deposed queen, Bertha, made forays into Philip's territory, but accomplished nothing. Meanwhile, 

Philip incited one of his barons to make war on and imprison the Bishop of Chartres, who had 

dared to denounce the marriage with Bertrade. The whole power of the Church was soon enlisted 

against him, and Pope Urban II. despatched a special legate to dissolve the marriage, or to 

excommunicate Philip if he did not leave his paramour. The Bishop of Chartres was promptly 

released, and Philip attempted to forestall further action on the part of his enemies by calling a 

special council at Rheims to try the bishop on a frivolous charge. But the legate summoned 

another council at Autun, which issued a decree of excommunication against Philip and Bertrade 

in October, 1094.  Though Queen Bertha was now dead, the ecclesiastical censure still held good. 

According to one of the conditions of the decree, Philip was to put off his crown. He obeyed this to 

the letter, refused to wear any insignia of royalty, and feigned to have ceased all intercourse with 

Bertrade. The Pope gave him till All Saints' Day, 1095, to reform, being afraid to use extreme 

measures while a rival Pope, already sustained by the German Emperor, might entice the King of 

France into his following. All Saints' Day came and went, and still Philip and Bertrade were 


_
and she closed it and cast it in the river Nile by night._ And the family (_or servants_) of Pharaoh 

lighted upon him _in the ark on the morrow of that night_;[258] _so they put it before him, and it 

was opened, and Moses was taken forth from it, sucking milk from his thumb:_ [this happened] 

that he might be unto them _eventually_ an enemy (_slaying their men_) and an affliction 

(_making slaves of their women_); for Pharaoh and Haman (_his Wezeer_) and their forces were 

sinners; _wherefore they were punished by his hand_. And the wife of Pharaoh said, _when he 

and his servants had proposed to kill him_, He _is_ delight of the eye unto me and unto thee: do 

not ye kill him: peradventure he may be serviceable unto us, or we may adopt him as a son. _And 

they complied with her desire_; and they knew not _the consequence_.  And the heart of the 

mother of Moses, _when she knew of his having been lighted upon_, became disquieted; and she 

had almost made him known _to be her son_, had We not fortified her heart with patience, that 

she might be [one] of the believers _in Our promise_. And she said unto his sister _Maryam_ [or 

Mary], Trace him, _that thou mayest know his case_. And she watched him as man and wife. 

Once more Philip was excommunicated, by a council held at Clermont; he again made fine 

promises of reformation, broke his word, and even had the audacity to have Bertrade consecrated 

as queen. Excommunication after excommunication was pronounced against him, and the 

kingdom was put under an interdict; he continued to make most generous promises about sending 

Bertrade back where she belonged, and still never did he do what he promised.  The terrors of 

excommunication had evidently lost their force, or else laymen and clerks alike were too much 

occupied with other important work before the council of Clermont, work whose effects were to 

influence profoundly the whole history of Europe and to bring about great social as well as great 

political changes: men were talking of the First Crusade. In the mighty stir of preparation, in the 

wild enthusiasm of that great movement, the king and his paramour were for the moment lost sight 

of. While men and women, and even children, were listening to the fierce eloquence of Peter the 

Hermit, and in inspired frenzy shouting out their approval: _Dieu le veult! Dieu le veult!_ who could 

stop to think of the idle and shifty King of France? 


_
not _that she was his sister and that she was watching him_. And We forbade him the breasts, 

_preventing him from taking the breast of any nurse except his mother_, before _his restoration to 

her_: so _his sister_ said, Shall I direct you unto the people of a house who will nurse him for you, 

and who will be faithful unto him? _And her offer was accepted; battle in the service of a greater 

king than he?  Yet the motives of even these first Crusaders were in some cases far from that 

consistent purity which one would expect. Among the leaders is one Guilhelm, Duke of Aquitaine 

and Count of Poitiers, a gay and famous troubadour, who has founded in his own domain a 

_maison de plaisir_ where the inmates are dressed
