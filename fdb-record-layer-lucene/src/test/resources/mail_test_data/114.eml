largeness of generalization gives him power over the imagination, and is, p=

certainly the chief source of his power. His color by its very intensity ov=
erdoes the intended effect.=20

The imagination instead of being stimulated is sated, and his obvious symbo=
lism fails to pique the=20

curiosity. Moreover, his handling of paint lacks sensitiveness. He has some=
thing of the disregard=20

shown by the English painter Watts for the beauty inherent in his material =
which might as well be=20

clay or textile as pigment in his hands. But his appreciation of the effect=
 upon the mind of noble=20

arrangements of space and mass raises him to a much higher place as an arti=
st than he can be=20

said to occupy as a painter.  [Illustration: FIDDLING DEATH  _From a portra=

Franz von Stuck is Boecklin's most distinguished follower. When we turn fro=
m the examples of=20

Boecklin's work, by no means the most impressive examples, exhibited in Ame=
rica, to Stuck's=20

"Inferno" we perceive both the influence of Boecklin and the powerful and o=
n consultation with two=20

of the South Carolina delegation in Washington, Governor Pickens was advise=
d by telegraph to=20

withdraw the letter, which was done. Trescot=E2=80=99s letter to Governor P=
ickens, returning that of the=20

latter, after mentioning all that had been done by the executive to refrain=
 from injuring the=20

sensibilities of South Carolina, said: The President=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Ccou=
rse had been violently denounced by the=20

Northern press, and an effort was being made to institute a Congressional i=
nvestigation. At that=20

moment he could not have gone to the extent of action you desired, and I fe=
lt confident that, if=20

forced to answer your letter then, he would have taken such ground as would=
 have prevented his=20

even approaching it hereafter; ... you had all the advantage of knowing the=
 truth, without the=20

disadvantage of having it put on record.... I was also perfectly satisfied =
that the status of the=20

Secretary of War; ... while I cannot even here=20

with it.  There is Boecklin's insistence upon the symbol, and upon the body=
ing forth of things=20

unseen, there is the solid violence of color, there is the pompous statemen=
t of the half-discerned=20

truths which more sensitive artists are content to whisper. But there is al=
so a splendid arabesque=20

of line and a deeper reading of the spiritual content of the subject.  If w=
e compare Stuck with=20

William Blake whose fancy also was haunted by Dantesque conceptions, we see=
 how much more=20

impressive Blake's visions of the unreal world are and we find the reason i=
n their swift energy of=20

conception and in the artist's tenacity in holding his conception. With bot=
h Boecklin and Stuck we=20

feel that the manner of rendering the conception becomes more important tha=
n the initial=20

conception, and this seldom, if ever, is true of Blake. In spite of Boeckli=
n's superb restraint in the=20

disposition of his in any way, I am prepared to say ... that nothing will b=
e done which will either do=20
