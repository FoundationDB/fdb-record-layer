"But, my dear Mrs. Spence," he protested, "you must remember that--that I k=
now nothing of the=20

case."  "What are the grounds one can get divorced on?" she asked.  He colo=
ured a little under his=20

tan.  "They are different in different states," he replied. "I think--perha=
ps --the best way would be to=20

read you the Massachusetts statutes."  "No--wait a moment," she said. "It's=
 very simple, after all,=20

what I have to tell you. I don't love my husband, and he doesn't love me, a=
nd it has become torture=20

to live together. I have left him with his knowledge and consent, and he un=
derstands that I will get=20

a divorce."  Mr. Wentworth appeared to be pondering--perhaps not wholly on =
the legal aspects of=20

the case thus naively presented. Whatever may have been his private comment=
s, they were=20

hidden. He pronounced tentatively, and a little absently, the word "deserti=
on."  "If the case could=20

possibly be construed as desertion on your husband's part, you could probab=
ly get a divorce in=20

three years in Massachusetts."  "Three years!" cried Honora, appalled. "I c=
ould never wait three=20

years!"  She did not remark the young lawyer's smile, which revealed a grea=
ter knowledge of the=20

world than one would have suspected. He said nothing, however.  "Three year=
s!" she repeated.=20

"Why, it can't be, Mr. Wentworth. There are the Waterfords--she was Mrs. Bo=
utwell, you=20

remember. And--and Mrs. Rindge--it was scarcely a year before--"  He had th=
e grace to nod=20

gravely, and to pretend not to notice the confusion in which she halted. La=
wyers, even young ones=20

with white teeth and clear eyes, are apt to be a little cynical. He had dou=
btless seen from the=20

beginning that there was a man in the background. It was not his business t=
o comment or to=20

preach.  "Some of the western states grant divorces on--on much easier term=
s," he said the=20

"perhapsing" in the world would have been useless had he not succeeded in b=
ringing the matter to=20

a satisfactory issue. And there he was at the bank exactly as the clock str=
uck one, and asking to=20

be allowed to say a word to Mr. Lethbridge, whispered in his ear, "It is al=
l right."     CHAPTER VIII.=20

PHOEBE IN PERIL.   After this breaking out of the sun in the dear home in C=
amden Town, with=20

respect to the money trouble, Aunt Leth's heart, as has been stated, fainte=
d within her when Mr.=20

Beeminster, introducing himself, said that he had called upon an inquiry of=
 a serious nature. She=20

mustered courage to say: "Is it anything about a debt? Is it anything about=
 my husband?"  Mr.=20

Beeminster stared at her, and answered: "No, not that I am aware of. The in=
quiry upon which I am=20

engaged relates to Miss Farebrother--your niece--and her father."  A sigh o=
f relief escaped Aunt=20

Leth's bosom, and Mr. Beeminster stared the harder at her.  "Have you heard=
 anything?" he=20

asked. "Do you know what has occurred?"  "I do not understand you," she rep=
lied.  "Miss=20

Farebrother has resided with you for--how long?"  "I cannot exactly say. Fo=
r some time; since she=20

left her father's house and came to us. But why do you question me?"  "You =
are not compelled to=20

answer. It may be that you have something to conceal."  "I have nothing to =
conceal," said Aunt=20

Leth indignantly.  "Or that, Miss Farebrother having got herself into troub=
le, it is your wish to=20

screen her."  "My niece has not got herself into trouble," said Aunt Leth, =
feeling herself in a certain=20

sense helpless in the hands of this man. "She is not capable of doing anyth=
ing wrong. I will answer=20

any reasonable questions you may put to me."  "It may be as well. Otherwise=
 you might be=20

suspected of a guilty knowledge. Miss Farebrother left her father's house a=
nd=20


_
up the laws of those states."  "I wish you would," answered Honora. "I don'=
t think I could bear to=20

spend three years in such--in such an anomalous condition. And at any rate =
I should much rather=20

go West, out of sight, and have it all as quickly over with as possible."  =
He bowed, and departed=20

on his quest. And Honora waited, at moments growing hot at the recollection=
 of her conversation=20

with him. Why--she asked herself should the law make it so difficult, and s=
ubject her to such with=20

you?"  "Yes; she has been in the habit of coming and stopping with us, from=
 time to time, since=20

she was a child."  "But never for so long a time as this?"  "That is true. =
We have a deep love for=20

her. Our home is hers."  "She ought to be grateful for it."  "She is."  "He=
r friends will best serve her=20

by being open and frank."  "But what has our dear child done?" asked Aunt L=
eth, in an imploring=20

tone. "What has she done?"  "You will hear presently, if you have a little =
patience. On=20


_
noble? Finally, her thoughts becoming too painful, she got up and looked ou=
t of the window. And=20

far below her, through the mist, she beheld the burying-ground of Boston's =
illustrious dead which=20

her cabman had pointed out to her as he passed. She did not hear the door o=
pen as Mr.=20

Wentworth returned, and she started at the sound of his voice.  "I take it =
for granted that you are=20

really serious in this matter, Mrs. Spence," he said.  "Oh!" she exclaimed.=
  "And that you have=20

thoroughly reflected," he continued imperturbably. Evidently, in spite of t=
he cold impartiality of the=20

law, a New England conscience had assailed him in the library. "I cannot ta=
ke er--the responsibility=20

of advising you as to a course of action. You have asked me the laws of cer=
tain western states as=20

to divorce I will read them."  An office boy followed occasion of her comin=
g to you did she do so=20

with her father's consent?"  "It is a family secret," replied Aunt Leth des=
pairingly.  "It will tell against=20

her if you refuse to answer. I am here in the cause of justice."  "Of justi=
ce?"  "Yes, of justice. You=20

refuse, then, to say whether she left her home in Parksides with her father=
's consent?"  "I do not=20

refuse. Her father was not kind to her; he turned her from his house."  "Th=
en when she came here=20

they were not upon friendly terms. It is the construction which every perso=
n would place upon it.=20

Have you any objection to say why he turned her from his house?"  "He wishe=
d to force her into a=20

hateful marriage; she would not consent."  "Were you and her father upon fr=
iendly terms?"  "We=20

were not."  "You harboured her, then, against his wish?"  "She had no other=
 shelter. We have=20


_
Mr. Wentworth read from them in a voice magnificently judicial.  "There's n=
ot much choice, is=20

there?" she faltered, when he had finished.  He smiled.  "As places of resi=
dence--" he began, in an=20

attempt to relieve the pathos.  "Oh, I didn't mean that," she cried. "Exile=
 is--is exile." She flushed.=20

After a few moments of own. Her mother was my sister."  "I know it. Since s=
he has been living=20

permanently with you has Miss Farebrother heard from her father?"  "He wrot=
e to her, but not in=20

answer to any letter of hers."  "Did he not say in his communication that i=
f she would obey him she=20

could return to Parksides?"  "Yes," said Aunt Leth,=20


_
which required a six months' residence. She contemplated him. "I hardly dar=
e to ask you to give=20

me the name of some reputable lawyer out there."  He had looked for an inst=
ant into her eyes.=20

Men of the law are not invulnerable, particularly at Mr. Wentworth's age, a=
nd New England=20

consciences to the contrary notwithstanding. In spite of himself, her eyes =
had made him a=20

partisan: an accomplice, he told himself afterwards.  "Really, Mrs. Spence,=
" he began, and caught=20

another knowledge, and in an agony of apprehension.  "Did Miss Farebrother =
reply to that letter?"=20

"No, she did not."  "I suppose that her conduct met with your approval? She=
 would be guided by=20

you?"  "I endeavoured to guide her aright. Her father showed no love for he=
r."  "But you may be=20

prejudiced. Since your marriage there has been no love lost between you and=
 Miser Farebrother?"=20

"I cannot deny it."  "I beg your pardon; these are matters which, perhaps, =
I should not go into.=20

They=20
