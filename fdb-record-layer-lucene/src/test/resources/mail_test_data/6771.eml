 coal carrying, and _
sobbed, and demanded an investigation. They each resented the suspicion as =
cruel and unjust. A=20

boy engaged as page and kitchen-assistant was defiant, and hinted vaguely t=
hat his father and=20

mother would not stand it; that Mr. Green would hear about it; and that he =
would not stay in the=20

house another moment after his boxes were searched--which they might be at =
once.  The search=20

began with the boxes of the young male servant, and nothing was traced in t=
hem.  The trunks of=20

the favoured young woman of superior beauty and accomplishments were next s=
earched. In one=20

of them was found one of these trinkets and a duplicate of the other.  Mr. =
Green's rage knew no=20

bounds. In vain the girl protested her innocence, and declared it was the w=
icked device of some=20

wretch for her destruction, or horrid conspiracy by some dreadful enemy to =
blast her reputation=20

and dishonour her poor parents, which planted the evidence against her.  Th=
e merchant told her=20

that if she confessed her crime he might forgive her. She would not admit a=
 crime that, she said,=20

she had not committed.  Mrs. Green remonstrated with the girl about her obs=
tinacy, and advised=20

her that it would be better to confess an offence which was so fairly broug=
ht home to her, and=20

against the evidence of which it was impossible for a single moment to cont=
end. The girl threw=20

herself upon her mistress's sympathy, hoping that _she_ at least could not =
think her guilty of the=20

crime attributed to her, although appearances were so much against her.  At=
 last, under the cross-

fire from these accusers, the young woman, who still refused to confess, dr=
opped into a chair, and,=20

in tones of agony, implored God to witness that she had never taken a thing=
 that did not belong to=20

her from any human being.  Mr. Green said this was more than he could stand=
. Such frightful=20

hypocrisy, such horrid cant, such blasphemy, was the grossest outrage upon =
Heaven he had ever=20

beheld. He told the boy to fetch a policeman, which service the lad rendere=
d with alacrity. The=20

already-convicted thief was given into the custody of the officer, taken to=
 the station-house, and=20

locked up.  The next day at the police-court the evidence of these facts wa=
s laid before the=20

magistrate. The pawnbroker who had taken in the pledge was not able to iden=
tify the prisoner as=20

the female who had pawned the article; but said that she was about the heig=
ht, age, and=20

appearance of the prisoner, although he would not swear to her. It was pled=
ged, he said, about the=20

hour of twelve in the morning; and Mrs. Green being called upon to give evi=
dence as to the=20

movements of her servant, with a view of confirming or breaking down the pa=
wnbroker's=20

suspicion--as the case might be--was obliged to say that Eliza had been out=
 on an errand for her=20

mistress between eleven and twelve o'clock on the day referred to.  The sce=
ne in that police-court=20

was one of the most painful things ever witnessed. The prisoner had no prof=
essional assistance.=20

No expert  =E2=80=9CThe river policeman who in one case threatened a refrac=
tory crew with imprisonment,=20

and urged them to do their duty (!) told me afterwards (when they were all =
drowned) that he and=20

his colleagues at the river-side station had spoken to each other about the=
 ship being dreadfully=20

overloaded as she passed their station on the river, before he went on boar=
d to urge duty (!) and=20

that he then, when he saw me, =E2=80=99rued badly that he had not locked =
=E2=80=99em up without talk, as then they=20

wouldn=E2=80=99t have been drowned.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  He also found that s=
ome ship-builders put together mere floating=20

coffins, using =E2=80=9Cdevils,=E2=80=9D or dummy bolts, or bolt-heads with=
out any shaft, to present the appearance=20

of a staunchly built vessel. The old shell would founder in the first stron=
g breeze. Hundreds of=20

examples came in his way of entire crews lost in these hulks. What such los=
ses meant to the poor=20

dependent families at home we may imagine, but may not readily portray.  An=
other prolific source=20

of disaster was the neglect to supply captains with the proper charts. Ther=
e are notable instances=20



of great vessels so lost. One ship and cargo, value $350,000, was lost near=
 Boulogne, because=20

the captain=E2=80=99s chart had not the lights properly marked on it.  The =
great steamer _Deutschland_,=20

having a large number  [Illustration: WRECK OF THE MINOTAUR.]  of German em=
igrants on=20

board, ran on an unmarked shoal near the mouth of the Thames, December 30, =
1875, and was=20

lost. The vessel was fourteen hours on the shoal in the winter storm, ere h=
er signals of distress=20

were perceived. Fifty-seven of her passengers had been lost in the heavy se=
a ere help reached=20

her.  Ship after ship has left her port, never to be heard of again, whose =
crews might have still=20

been in peace and comfort with their families, had the owners had the least=
 trace of humanity, or=20

regard for simple justice. A single example will illustrate.  In a hovel, P=
limsoll found a young wife,=20

scrubbing for a living, trying to support herself and three children. =E2=
=80=9CShe had a loving husband but=20

very lately, but the owner of the ship on which he served, the _S----n_, wa=
s a very needy man,=20

who insured her for =C2=A33,000 more than she had cost him. So if she sank =
he would gain all this.=20

Well, one voyage she was loaded _under the owner=E2=80=99s personal superin=
tendence_; she was loaded=20

so deeply that the dockmaster pointed her out to a friend as she left the d=
ock, and said=20

emphatically, =E2=80=98That ship will never reach her destination.=E2=80=99=
 She never did, for she was lost with all=20

hands--twenty men and boys.=E2=80=9D  Under the owner=E2=80=99s personal su=
perintendence! Could cool=20

calculating villany go any further? Yet this is but one out of many scores!=
  Yet, despite the=20

apparent frequency of complaints from those who suffered most by these prac=
tices, the abuses=20

had grown up so gradually that the masses of the people had come to accept =
them as almost a=20

necessary concomitant of naval matters. While holding out stoutly for the d=
ifference of a penny=20

more or less in=20


_
said, was a repetition of what she had told her mistress and master and the=
ir friend the night=20

before. She protested that she was as innocent as an unborn child; that her=
 hands had been=20

trained by parents (whose memory she revered, and who tenderly loved her) t=
o honest industry;=20

and that she had no more perpetrated these thefts than the worthy magistrat=
e. She appealed to=20

her mistress to bear evidence of her general character. (Mr. Green was not =
in court.) Her mistress=20

gave her a general good character, and expressed the grief of herself and h=
er husband at the=20

discovery in the servant's boxes.  The magistrate put a question or two to =
the mistress, who=20

seemed concerted action for better treatment. Men accustomed to risking the=
ir lives daily came to=20

look upon the matter as of no great consequence. Only the worst possible ve=
ssels were very=20

seriously objected to; and these usually had little difficulty in obtaining=
 crews of men long out of=20

employment, who would accept any risk rather than remain a burden to their =
friends and families,=20

however the latter might object to the proceeding. So thousands went to a w=
atery grave. Official=20

records of the period showed that one-half the losses at sea were the resul=
t of sending out rotten=20

hulks. Yet, when reforms were suggested, the promoters were frequently told=
 that if such=20


_
betray an idea that one of the other servants, or some friend, had been the=
 thief; or that, at least,=20

the accused had not been, although she did not say as much in distinct term=
s.  The tone and=20

manner of the girl had evidently impressed the magistrate with the belief t=
hat she was not in her=20

proper place when in that dock before him as a criminal. He, however, remar=
ked that the case was=20

one of very grave suspicion, and that he should remand her for a week, in o=
rder that inquiries=20

might be made, with a view to as a matter of political economy, there was n=
o use striving for a=20

change. Cool weighing of human life against gold!  Even in staunch ships th=
e accommodations=20

provided for the sailors were of the meanest sort. Men might wade to their =
bunks through water, or=20

be packed in a filthy forecastle like herrings; they were fed on =E2=80=9Cs=
alt horse=E2=80=9D and moldy biscuit; they=20

might rot with scurvy--if the ship got to port with her cargo, it made litt=
le difference how the crew=20

fared.  Our own ships and the Russian and French vessels=20
