jurisdiction to compel the plaintiff to submit to such an examination.  Thi=
s decision has been=20

followed by the courts of several of the western and southern States, while=
 in others the power has=20

been denied. These cases will be found fully collected in Roberts _v._ O. &=
 L. C. R. Co. and in U.=20

P. R. R. Co. _v._ Botsford cited above.  The ground of the decision of the =
United States Supreme=20

Court and of the New York Court of Appeals seems to be, that in the absence=
 of legislative=20

provision permitting a court to order such an examination, it has no inhere=
nt power to do so, and=20

did not derive any such powers from the common-law courts of England, which=
 never had=20

exercised such powers.  In some of the cases which deny the right to compel=
 such examination, it=20

is claimed that if such a statute was passed as would confer upon the court=
s power to compel=20

such an examination, the statute would be unconstitutional, and much is sai=
d in those decisions=20

about the sacredness and immunity of the person. It seems difficult, howeve=
r, to understand why=20

such statutes should be considered as differing in any respect from statute=
s permitting orders for=20

the examination of witnesses and parties before trial, or for the discovery=
 and inspection of books=20

and papers, and the like, which statutes have been enacted for many years a=
nd have never been=20

held to be unconstitutional. Surely an honest suitor having a just claim fo=
r damages for personal=20



injuries would not object to such an examination, because the result would =
often strengthen his=20

case, while a dishonest suitor having a false and unmeritorious claim ought=
 to be exposed and=20

have his false claims defeated, in the interests of justice and truth. On t=
he other hand, a suitor who=20

was honestly mistaken in his belief that he had been disfigured or injured =
by an act of malpractice=20

might often discover his mistake, and be saved the annoyance and expense of=
 defeat after a trial=20

in open court.  Some of the most frequent cases of alleged malpractice, bro=
ught before the courts,=20

are those in which it is claimed that a fractured limb has been improperly =
set, with the result that it=20

becomes crooked or shortened; when the fact is, as is conclusively shown by=
 Prof. Frank H.=20

Hamilton in a paper published by him many years ago, and quoted with approv=
al by Professor=20

Elwell, in his work on Malpractice, etc., that the percentage of cases, in =
certain kinds of fractures,=20

in which perfect results are obtained by even the most eminent surgeons, is=
 very small. In such=20

cases as these the true state of affairs might often be disclosed by carefu=
l inspection prior to the=20

trial. On the whole more good than harm would seem to be the probable outco=
me of permitting=20

such examinations, in malpractice cases, if not in all cases of alleged per=
sonal injuries.  =3DEvidence=20

in Malpractice Cases.=3D=E2=80=94The prevailing trial practice in malpracti=
ce cases is to prove the condition=20

of the patient prior to the employment of defendant and at the time the tre=
atment in question=20

began, the methods of treatment adopted, and instructions given, and the co=
ndition of the patient=20

during and after such treatment, and then to place other physicians on the =
witness-stand, and put=20

to them hypothetical questions involving the facts as established by the ev=
idence, and calling upon=20

them to state whether the method of treatment adopted indicated proper skil=
l and care, or even the=20

usual and recognized methods of the profession.[206]  In some States eviden=
ce of the general=20

reputation of the defendant for skilfulness or the contrary is held admissi=
ble. In other States such=20

evidence is held inadmissible (see Vol. XIV., Am. and Eng. Encyclop=C3=A6di=
a of Law, p. 83, and=20

cases collected in Note 6).  =3DContributory Negligence.=3D=E2=80=94In conc=
lusion it should be stated that the=20

patient is bound to follow obediently all proper directions given him by hi=
s physician or surgeon, as=20

to his diet, mode of life, time of taking and quantity of medicine to be ta=
ken, or the care of a=20

diseased or injured member. Any disobedience of such directions which contr=
ibutes to prevent a=20

recovery will bar him from his right of action for malpractice, even though=
 the medical man may=20

have been somewhat negligent. In short, the same rule as to contributory ne=
gligence applies in=20

this as in any other case of negligence. This principle has been so long an=
d so well settled that=20

citation of authority in support of it is unnecessary.     THE LAW OF EVIDE=
NCE  CONCERNING=20

CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS  BETWEEN  PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT.  BY  CHARLES=
=20

A. BOSTON,  _Counsellor-at-Law, of the New York City Bar_.     CONFIDENTIAL=
=20

COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT.   PRIVILEGED=20

COMMUNICATIONS.  CONFIDENTIAL communications between physician and patient =
not=20

infrequently may relate to matters that are the subjects of inquiry before =
judicial tribunals. When=20

these communications are by law excluded from disclosure in evidence, they =
are termed=20

_privileged_ communications. When such a disclosure is forbidden it is upon=
 grounds of public=20

policy,[207] =E2=80=9Cbecause greater mischiefs would probably result from =
requiring or permitting its=20

admission, than from wholly rejecting it.=E2=80=9D   COMMON LAW.  The commo=
n law required an=20

inviolable secrecy to be observed by attorneys with reference to the commun=
ications which they=20

had received from their clients.[208] But writers upon the law of evidence =
state that under the=20



English rule protection from disclosure in evidence in a court of justice w=
as not extended to=20

communications between a medical man and his patient.[209]  _Reasons for th=
e Rule._=E2=80=94It does=20

not clearly appear, in any of the cases usually cited as authority, why the=
 distinction is made=20

between legal and medical advisers, but it is apparent that the privilege d=
oes not rest upon=20

considerations of honor nor of confidence,[210] nor even upon the urgency o=
f the situation under=20

which the communication is made; for disclosures are made to a physician fr=
equently to save life,=20

or to a priest for reasons of eternal import, while those made to an attorn=
ey insure at most=20

protection from temporal annoyance. The privilege of attorneys seems to be =
founded upon=20

considerations of public policy in the administration of justice in the cou=
rts; attorneys are a part of=20

the system, as are grand jurors, petit jurors, and judges,[211] and even ar=
bitrators;[212] but=20

physicians are no part of that system, and a disclosure of confidences made=
 to them in no way=20

tends to weaken the system or render it ineffectual, while the compulsory e=
xamination of lawyers=20

would tend to the suppression of the truth in litigation by discouraging co=

 the Constitution,=20

treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, ar=
e regarded as rules of=20

decision.[219] Section 858 of the Revised Statutes of the United States pre=
scribes rules with=20

reference to competency notwithstanding color and interest of witnesses, an=
d in actions by or=20

against executors, administrators, or guardians, and then provides that =E2=
=80=9Cin all other respects the=20

laws of the State in which the court is held shall be the rules of decision=
 as to the competency of=20

witnesses in the courts of the United States in trials at _common law_, and=
 in _equity_ and=20

_admiralty_.=E2=80=9D Accordingly it has been held by the Supreme Court of =
the United States that in an=20

action in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District =
of New York, on a policy of=20

life insurance, the evidence of a physician, inadmissible under Section 834=
 of the New York Code=20

of Civil Procedure, was properly excluded.[220] But in criminal prosecution=
s in United States=20

Courts, the privilege secured by State statutes does not avail.[221]   THE =
STATUTES.  As the=20

effect of these statutes depends largely upon their language, the construct=
ion put upon the law in=20

one State is chiefly serviceable in interpreting that of another State in t=
hose particulars where the=20

two are similar.  _Statutory Declarations of Policy._=E2=80=94A comparative=
 view of the several laws=20

shows that in the following States and Territory there are declarations of =
policy prefixed to the=20

prohibition of disclosures, that show the reason of the enactment, namely: =
California, Colorado,=20



Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, and Utah.[22=
2] The declaration=20

is to the effect that there are particular relations in which it is the pol=
icy of the law to encourage=20

confidence and to preserve it inviolate, and that therefore the prohibition=
 of the statute is laid.=20

ANALYSIS OF THE STATUTES.  The common purpose of the statutes is to restric=
t the rule=20

compelling disclosures so as to protect communications with a physician in =
his professional=20

capacity; but the limit to which the protection is extended differs in the =
various States. An analytic=20

comparison of the statutes tends to show how far the interpretation of one =
is useful in construing=20

another.  _I. Nature of the Exclusion._=E2=80=94In California, Idaho, Minne=
sota, Montana, North Dakota,=20

Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Washington the statutes apply only to testi=
mony in civil=20

actions.[223] The other statutes make no distinction between civil and crim=
inal proceedings.  The=20

active words are of course different in the several statutes, but they indi=
cate a purpose to extend a=20

privilege that the person entitled to it may insist upon maintaining, with =
the single exception of the=20

law of North=20

Disposal of superior court may compel a disclosure, if in his opinion the s=

proper administration of justice.  Some of the statutes show clearly that i=
t is the patient=E2=80=99s privilege,=20

and suffer the patient or his representatives to waive it, either expressly=
 or by conduct which the=20

law declares to amount to a waiver.[224] Others are silent on this subject.=
  In California, Colorado,=20

Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, =
Ohio, Oregon,=20

South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, it is expressly provided that =
the patient=E2=80=99s consent=20

is necessary before a disclosure will be permitted.  In Colorado, Kansas, O=
klahoma, and Oregon,=20

if the patient offer himself or a physician or surgeon as a witness, that i=
s to be deemed a consent.=20

In Nevada, in any suit or prosecution for malpractice, if the patient or pa=
rty suing or prosecuting=20

shall require or give consent, and any physician or surgeon shall give test=
imony, then the=20

defendant may call any other physicians or surgeons as witnesses without th=

 voluntarily testify the=20
