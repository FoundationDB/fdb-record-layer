  CHAPTER VIII  CHICKENS=20

COMING HOME TO ROOST  Skinner _did_ look worried, but what ailed him was ve=
ry foreign to=20

the cause that McLaughlin and Perkins suspected.  He was worrying about his=
 diminishing bank=20

account.  But it was n't the actual diminution of funds that worried him so=
 much--he was afraid=20

Honey would find him out.  For a long time this fear had haunted him.  Like=
 a wasp, it had buzzed=20

constantly about his ears, threatening to sting him at any moment.  It had =
become a veritable=20

obsession, a mean, haunting, appetite-destroying, sleep-banishing obsession=
.  There were many=20

ways in which this fear might be realized.  For instance, Honey had told hi=
m that she was thinking=20

of studying finance so as to find out all the little leakages and help them=
 save, and that she was=20

going to ask Mr. Waldron, the teller of the Meadeville National, to instruc=
t her in the intricacies of=20

banking.  What inadvertent remark might not that functionary drop and thus =
sow suspicion in=20

Honey?  At first, Skinner had thought of warning the teller not to discuss =
these things with Honey.=20

But he made up his mind that that might direct Waldron's attention to their=
 account and lead him to=20

suspect something from the new process of circulation which Skinner had set=
 going when he=20

promoted himself.  No--better let sleeping dogs lie in that direction.  Ins=
tead, Skinner persuaded=20

Honey that it would be an imposition on Mr. Waldron, take up too much of hi=
s time.  He, Skinner,=20

would give her what instruction she needed.  The more the "cage man" scheme=
d to keep his wife=20

from finding out the deception he'd practiced on her, the more possibilitie=
s of exposure developed,=20

and the more apprehensive he became.  No sooner did Honey promise not to bo=
ther Mr. Waldron=20

than another danger popped up.  By Jingo!  There was Mrs. McLaughlin!  Hone=
y might again=20

mention to her something about his raise, reiterate what she had hinted at =
on the night of the First=20

Presbyterian reception.  No doubt, if she did, Mrs. McLaughlin would quiz h=
er this time, find out=20

what she was driving at, and report it to McLaughlin and make him, Skinner,=
 a laughing-stock in=20

the eyes of the boss.  Then, by a series of recoils, McLaughlin would deny =
it to his wife, Mrs.=20

McLaughlin would deny it to Honey, and there'd be the devil to pay.  And pa=
ying the devil, in this=20

particular instance, Skinner apprehended, would be a hard proposition.  Ins=
tigated by this fear,=20

ever since the night of the First Presbyterian affair Skinner had schemed t=
o keep Mrs. McLaughlin=20

and Honey apart.  It was easy enough at first, when they were only invited =
to a few affairs, but with=20

the enlargement of their social horizon the danger loomed bigger.  Skinner =
knew enough about=20

women not to warn Honey against talking confidentially with Mrs. McLaughlin=
, since this would=20

excite her suspicions and recoil upon him, Skinner, with a shower of inconv=
enient questions.  The=20

only thing he could do, then, was to see to it that he and Honey should avo=
id places where the=20

McLaughlins were liable to be. Skinner had been put to all sorts of devices=
 to find out if the=20

McLaughlins were going to certain parties to which he and Honey had been in=
vited.  He could n't=20

do this very well by discussing the thing with poets deified him. The days =
of Homer died not in=20

Homer's verse. We have as glorious heroes to-day as have been handed down, =
immortalized from=20

those by-gone times. We have hearts as valiant, and souls as noble, and lov=
e as sweet and pure,=20

in this age which is dubbed commercial and prosaic; and though Tom Barley h=
as a wooden leg, he=20

is worthy to shake hands with Achilles. No such desire possesses him, or po=
ssessed him, when=20

he saw Phoebe sitting by his bedside in the hospital.  "You are getting str=
ong again, Tom?"  "Yes,=20

Miss Phoebe; thank God! Is everybody well?"  "Everybody, Tom."  "Your aunt =
and uncle, and Miss=20



Fanny and Master Robert?"  "They are all well, Tom. They send their love, a=
nd will come and see=20

you when they are allowed."  "They are very good. And Mr. Cornwall, Miss Ph=
oebe--he is well, I=20

hope?"  "Quite well, Tom. He is below, waiting for me."  "I am glad to hear=
 it, Miss Phoebe. But=20

perhaps I am making a mistake."  "In what, Tom?"  "In calling you Miss Phoe=
be."  "No, Tom." She=20

held up her left hand.  "If I dared to ask a favour?"  "You may dare to ask=
 anything, Tom."  "That I=20

may be allowed to come to the wedding?"  "Indeed, Tom, I think that is what=
 we are waiting for.=20

We could not be happy without you."  "I can't thank you now, Miss Phoebe," =
said Tom, tears=20

gathering in his eyes. "I will when I'm stronger. There is another thing." =
 "Yes, Tom?"  "Say that=20

you forgive me!"  "Ah, Tom!"  "It will make me happy, Miss Phoebe."  "Only =
because you have that=20

foolish idea in your head--Tom, I forgive you!"  She stooped and kissed him=
, as she had kissed=20

him on the morning he brought her from Parksides and gave her into the care=
 of her good Aunt=20

Leth.  "I am truly grateful," murmured Tom, in a choking voice, as he turne=
d his face to the wall.=20

CHAPTER XIX.  OFF FOR THE HONEY-MOON.   "Welcome the coming, speed the part=
ing,=20

guest." Therefore shall our last chapter be short.  In the autumn of the fo=
llowing year a quiet=20

wedding-party assembled after church in Aunt Leth's house. To be exact, it =
was a double=20

wedding-party--Phoebe and Fred, Fanny and Dick. It was a gathering of frien=
ds, some of whom=20

have played their parts in this story, and whom, I hope, we have grown to l=
ove. The Lethbridge=20

family, of course--I cannot stop to relate the wonderful day-dream Uncle Le=
th had on that morning-

-and Mr. and Mrs. Linton and Kiss, and 'Melia Jane and Tom Barley; those we=
re the principal=20

ones. There were also connections of Fred Cornwall and Dick Garden, all ami=
able, pleasant=20

persons, if one could judge from their faces. Tom Barley had just whispered=
 something to 'Melia=20

Jane, and her answer was,  "Lor', Tom; I'm ashamed to think of it!"  "Then =
you won't," whispered=20

Tom.  "Yes, I will," replied 'Melia Jane, very quickly. "It was the way the=
 fortune came out last=20

night. But to think of it, Tom! to think of it!"  And to the surprise of al=
l, not one of whom had heard a=20

word of what had passed, 'Melia Jane threw her apron over her head, where i=
t hung down like a=20

bridal veil. She had put on the apron when she came from the church into th=
e house, to wait upon=20

the company. It was a smarter apron than usual, and she was proud of it; an=
d, as you see, she put=20

it to good use--to hide her blushes.  The two young couples will set up hou=
se-keeping on the day=20

they return from their honey-moon tour. The houses are taken, and Aunt Leth=
 will be very busy=20

while they are away setting=20


_
boss.  So he had endeavored to determine the exact social status of the McL=
aughlins in that=20

community and avoid the stratum in which they might circulate.  But this ru=
le had failed him once=20

or twice, for in communities of the description of Meadeville social life w=
as more or less democratic=20

and nondescript.  When he had thought himself secure on certain occasions, =
he had bumped right=20

into the McLaughlins and then it behooved him to stick pretty close to Hone=
y all the evening.  This=20

was not what he counted on, for Skinner was beginning to enjoy the sweets o=
f broader social=20

intercourse.  He was beginning to like to talk with and dance with other wo=
men.  At times, when=20

Skinner had received information at the last moment that the McLaughlins we=
re to be at a party,=20

he had affected a headache.  On one of these occasions, Honey had set her h=
eart on going and=20

told Skinner that the Lewises had offered to take her along with them in ca=
se he should be=20

delayed at the office--for Skinner had even pretended once or twice to be t=
hus delayed.  Presto! at=20

Honey's words about the Lewises, Dearie's headache had disappeared.  Skinne=
r thought with a=20

humorous chuckle how Honey had said, "Dearie, I believe you're jealous of T=
om Lewis."  "Perhaps=20

I am," the miserable Skinner had admitted.  Skinner pictured the effect of =
exposure in all sorts of=20

dramatic ways. But not once did he see himself suffering--only Honey.  That=
's what worried him.=20

He could bear pain without flinching, but he could not bear ones. Tom Barle=
y will live with Phoebe=20

and Fred as gardener--that is, unless he and 'Melia Jane decide to set up a=
 separate=20

establishment of their own. Tom is in a position to do this. He has receive=
d the five hundred=20

pounds offered as a reward for the recovery of the diamond bracelet, and at=
 least another five=20

hundred subscribed by an admiring public for his gallant conduct.  "How do =
you do, Mrs.=20

Cornwall?" whispered Fanny to Phoebe.  "How do you do, Mrs. Garden?" whispe=
red Phoebe to=20

Fanny.  Then they stepped aside and kissed and embraced, with faces like an=
 April day--one of=20

the brightest and most beautiful of April days.  Their last kisses, their l=
ast embraces, are for Aunt=20

Leth. She stands at the door gazing after the carriages with sweet and wist=
ful eyes. And so the=20

young people commence their happy wedded life.   THE END       PRINTED BY  =
