 He said: =E2=80=9CEvery person=20

highest possible degree of skill, as there may be persons of higher educati=
on and greater=20

advantages than himself; but he undertakes to bring a fair, reasonable and =
competent degree of=20

skill. And in an action against him by a patient, the question for the jury=
 is whether the injury=20

complained of must be referred to a want of proper degree of skill and care=
 in the defendant, or=20



not. Hence he is never presumed to engage for extraordinary skill, or for e=
