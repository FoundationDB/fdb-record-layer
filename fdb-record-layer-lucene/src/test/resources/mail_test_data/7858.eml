(Max Mueller, _Buddhist Pilgrims_.)      From one end to the other the coun=
try is full of mystics,=20

religious philosophers, Buddhist saints and magicians. Belief in a     spir=
itual world, full of invisible=20

beings who, on certain     occasions, appear to mortals objectively, is uni=
versal. "According     to=20

the belief of the nations of Central Asia," remarks I. J.     Schmidt, "the=
 earth and its interior, as=20

well as the encompassing     atmosphere, are filled with spiritual beings, =
which exercise an=20

influence, partly beneficent, partly malignant, on the whole of     organic=
 and inorganic nature....=20

Especially are deserts, and other     wild and uninhabited tracts, or regio=
ns in which the influences=20

of     nature are displayed on a gigantic and terrible scale, regarded as  =
   the chief abode or=20

rendez-vous of evil spirits. And hence the     steppes of Turan, and in par=
ticular the great sandy=20

desert of     Gobi, have been looked on as the dwelling place of malignant =
    beings, from days of=20

hoary antiquity."      The treasures exhumed by Dr. Schliemann at Mycenae, =
have awakened=20

popular cupidity, and the eyes of adventurous speculators are     being tur=
ned toward the localities=20

where the wealth of ancient     peoples is supposed to be buried, in crypt =
or cave, or beneath=20

sand or alluvial deposit. Around no other locality, not even Peru,     hang=
 so many traditions as=20

around the Gobi Desert. In independent     Tartary this howling waste of sh=
ifting sand was once, if=20

report     speaks correctly, the seat of one of the richest empires the wor=
ld     ever saw. Beneath=20

the surface is said to lie such wealth in gold,     jewels, statuary, arms,=
 utensils, and all that=20

indicates     civilization, luxury, and fine arts, as no existing capital o=
f     Christendom can show to-

day. The Gobi sand moves regularly from     east to west before terrific ga=
les that blow continually.=20

Occasionally some of the hidden treasures are uncovered, but not a     nati=
ve dare touch them, for=20

the whole district is under the ban of     a mighty spell. Death would be t=
he penalty. Bahti--hideous,=20

but     faithful gnomes--guard the hidden treasures of this prehistoric    =
 people, awaiting the day=20

when the revolution of cyclic periods     shall again cause their story to =
be known for the instruction=20

of     mankind.(29)   The above is purposely quoted from _Isis Unveiled_ to=
 refresh the reader's=20

memory. One of the cyclic periods has just been passed, and we may not have=
 to wait to the end=20

of Maha Kalpa to have revealed something of the history of the mysterious d=
esert, in spite of the=20

Bahti, and even the Rakshasas of India, not less "hideous." No tales or fic=
tions were given in our=20

earlier volumes, their chaotic state notwithstanding, to which chaos the wr=
iter, entirely free from=20

vanity, confesses publicly and with many apologies.  It is now generally ad=
mitted that, from time=20

immemorial, the distant East, India especially, was the land of knowledge a=
nd of every kind of=20

learning. Yet there is none to whom the origin of all her Arts and Sciences=
 has been so much=20

denied as to the land of the primitive Aryas. From Architecture down to the=
 Zodiac, every Science=20

worthy of the name was imported by the Greeks, the mysterious Yavanas--agre=
eably with the=20

decision of the Orientalists! Therefore, it is but logical that even the kn=
owledge of Occult Science=20

should be refused to India, since of its general practice in that country l=
ess is known than in the=20

case of any other ancient people. It is so, simply because:       With the =
Hindus it was, and is, more=20

esoteric, if possible, than     it was even among the Egyptian priests. So =
sacred was it deemed=20

that its existence was only half admitted, and it was only     practised in=
 public emergencies. _It=20

was more than a religious     matter, for it was [and is still] considered =
divine._ The Egyptian=20

hierophants, notwithstanding the practice of a stern and pure     morality,=
 could not be compared=20

for one moment with the ascetical     Gymnosophists, either in holiness of =
life or miraculous=20

powers     developed in them by the supernatural abjuration of everything  =
   earthly. By those who=20



knew them well they were held in still     greater reverence than the magia=
ns of Chaldaea.=20

"Denying themselves     the simplest comforts of life, they dwelt in woods,=
 and led the     life of the=20

most secluded hermits,"(30) while their Egyptian     brothers at least cong=
regated together.=20

Notwithstanding the slur     thrown on all who practised magic and divinati=
on, history has=20

proclaimed them as possessing the greatest secrets in medical     knowledge=
 and unsurpassed=20

skill in its practice. Numerous are the     volumes preserved in Hindu Math=
ams, in which are=20

recorded the     proofs of their learning. To attempt to say whether these =
    Gymnosophists were=20

the real founders of magic in India, or whether     they only practised wha=
t had passed to them as=20

an inheritance from     the earliest Rishis(31)--the seven primeval sages--=
would be regarded     as=20

mere speculation by exact scholars.(32)   Nevertheless, this must be attemp=
ted. In _Isis=20

Unveiled_, all that could be stated about Magic was set down in the guise o=
f hints; and thus, owing=20

to the great amount of material scattered over two large volumes, much of i=
ts importance was lost=20

upon the reader, while it still more failed to draw his attention on accoun=
t of the faulty=20

arrangement. But hints may now grow into explanations. One can never repeat=
 it too often--

_Magic is as old as man_. It cannot any longer be called charlatanry or hal=
lucination, when its=20

lesser branches--such as mesmerism, now miscalled "hypnotism," "thought rea=
ding," "action by=20

suggestion," and what not else, only to avoid calling it by its right and l=
egitimate name--are being=20

so seriously investigated by the most famous Biologists and Physiologists o=
f both Europe and=20

America. Magic is indissolubly blended with the Religion of every country a=
nd is inseparable from=20

its origin. It is as impossible for History to name the time when it was no=
t, as that of the epoch=20

when it sprang into existence, unless the doctrines preserved by the Initia=
tes are taken into=20

consideration. Nor can Science ever solve the problem of the origin of man =
if it rejects the=20

evidence of the oldest records in the world, and refuses from the hand of t=
he legitimate Guardians=20

of the mysteries of Nature the key to Universal Symbology. Whenever a write=
r has tried to connect=20

the first foundation of Magic with a particular country or some historical =
event or character, further=20

research has shown his hypothesis to be groundless. There is a most lamenta=
ble contradiction=20

among the Symbologists on this point. Some would have it that Odin, the Sca=
ndinavian priest and=20

monarch, originated the practice of Magic brown in 40, red-brown in 6, and =
3 times bluish.  In=20

about two-thirds of the cases the bottom of the furrow, the place of greate=
st pressure, is white,=20

especially so where the knot is tied; while the edges of the furrow are usu=
ally slightly raised and=20

red or livid. If the subject is very fat, there may be only a slight depres=
sion. Harvey[841] says that=20

this hard, white, shining, translucent band from compression of the connect=
ive tissue is the first=20

stage of the parchment or vellum skin, and is chiefly noticed in fresh bodi=
es. The borders are=20

swollen and =C5=93dematous, called by Lacassagne =E2=80=9C_bourrelet de sil=
lon_.=E2=80=9D  The skin beyond the=20

furrow is usually violet. Authors differ as to whether this is due to conge=
stion or hemorrhage.=20

Roth[842] in 49 cases found swelling below the furrow 27 times. Hackel foun=
d ecchymoses above=20

the mark in thirty-five per cent of the cases of hanging. Hofmann thinks th=
at the lividity of the upper=20

border of the furrow is due to the stopping of the venous blood descending =
from the head.  The=20

dry, hard, yellowish-brown, or reddish-brown =E2=80=9Cparchment=E2=80=9D fu=
rrow, described by writers, is said to=20

be common. Ogston[843] found it in one-third of his cases. It is found only=
 when the body has=20

remained suspended for several hours after death; indeed, may be produced b=
y applying the=20

ligature to the cadaver; is not at all, therefore, a proof of suspension du=
ring life. Liman states that=20



constriction by a ligature even for some time does not necessarily cause a =
mummified or=20

excoriated furrow. He saw cases in which the mark was soft, flat, scarcely =
colored, but little=20

interrupted, and not parchmenty. The parchment skin seems to depend very mu=
ch upon a=20

previous excoriation of the skin. Its appearance can be prevented or delaye=
d by examining a body=20

soon after death or by rehanging it; and after it has appeared it will disa=
ppear on the application of=20

some liquid. Taylor[844] compares this parchment mark to the cutis from whi=
ch the cuticle has=20

been removed for two or three days.  Slight abrasions and ecchymoses are so=
metimes found in=20

the furrow. Ecchymoses alone do not indicate whether suspension has been be=
fore or after death;=20

but abrasions with hemorrhage strongly suggest suspension during life. Deve=
rgie regards=20

ecchymoses of the neck as strongly suggestive of homicide. Neyding[845] say=
s that suggillation in=20

the groove is oftener found in strangulation than hanging. And Bremme[846] =
that there is no=20

hemorrhage in the subcutaneous tissue of the mark if death occurs at once a=
nd the cord is=20

removed at once after death; but if the cord remains for some time after de=
ath there may be=20

hemorrhage, or if death does not occur at once, whether the ligature be rem=
oved or not.=20

Roth[847] found ecchymoses or small bladders at the lower margin of the fur=
row, 9 times in 49=20

cases. Riechke found only once in 30 cases a hemorrhage beneath and on both=
 sides of the mark.=20

Chevers did not find ecchymoses of the skin of the mark in cases of hanging=
. Casper found no=20

ecchymoses in 50 of 71 cases. Maschka has seen two cases where burns on the=
 neck resembled=20

mark of ligature.  The furrow, when once distinct, remains constant for a l=
ong time after death,=20

even in putrefaction. Marks from soft substances, however, disappear sooner=
 than those from=20

strong and uniform compression.  The NECK nearly always appears stretched. =
According to Roth=20

the mobility of the head is increased by this stretching. The HEAD is alway=
s inclined to the=20

opposite side to that of the knot. In suicides the head is usually bent for=
ward on the chest. The=20

HANDS are often clinched so tightly that the nails are driven into the palm=
s. This occurs more=20

especially when the hanging has been done with violence. When the feet touc=
h the ground, as=20

often occurs in suicide, the hands may be stretched out. Roth found the han=
ds and feet flexed in=20

44 of 49 cases. Taylor says that we may expect to find the hands clinched w=
hen constriction of the=20

neck is sudden and violent. The LEGS are usually livid.  The FACE varies wi=
th the duration of the=20

suspension; at first it is pale, afterward livid; congested and swollen, if=
 the subject has been long=20

suspended. Roth found the face pale in 43 of 49 cases. In about one-half th=
e cases the features=20

are calm and placid (syncope). Maschka found the lips bluish in 98 of 153 c=
ases. The EYES are=20

often prominent, staring, and congested, and usually the pupils are dilated=
. Lacassagne and=20

Maschka[848] look upon ecchymoses of the eyelids and conjunctiv=C3=A6, =E2=
=80=9C_piquet=C3=A9 scarlatin_,=E2=80=9D as=20

important as favoring the idea of hanging or strangulation. Roth found in 4=
9 cases the eyelids=20

closed 28 times; half open, 12; congested in 6; ecchymosed in 2. Pupils dil=
ated in 31; narrowed in=20

2. Dilated in 97=C2=BD per cent of Ogston=E2=80=99s cases (Cases 85, 86; ru=
pture of crystalline lens).=20

Harvey[849] says the blood was found flowing from the EAR in 6 cases of nea=
rly 1,500, but no=20

details were given. Ogston, one case. Hofmann saw a case in which there was=
 bleeding from the=20

ears. He says this is not due, as has been supposed, to rupture of the tymp=
anic membrane, but to=20

hemorrhage from subcutaneous vessels (Case 27).  The TONGUE is usually livi=
d and swollen,=20

especially at the base. According to Tidy, Dr. Guy looks on this as showing=
 that suspension took=20

place very probably during life. In about one-third of the cases the tongue=
 is protruded and=20



compressed between the teeth; sometimes bitten. Some observers found it pro=
truded only as a=20

result of putrefaction. The protrusion of the tongue is not believed to dep=
end on the position of the=20

ligature. Hackel in 67 cases found the tongue lying forward in all cases wh=
ere the cord was=20

between the larynx and the hyoid; in 55 per cent in front of the teeth, in =
18 per cent between the=20

teeth; where the ligature was lower down, the tongue was behind the teeth. =
He found by=20

experiment that in the spasmodic expiratory effort the tongue was thrust fo=
rward; in the inspiratory=20

movement, drawn backward. He concluded that the forward movement was the re=
sult of reflex=20

action. Maschka[850] found the tongue between the teeth 58 times in 149 cas=
es. Roth in 49 cases=20

found the tongue projecting and bitten in 22, the teeth shut in 15 others; =
in 15 the mouth was=20

open; the tongue was retracted in 30 cases.   Harvey, after examining repor=
ts of nearly fifteen=20

hundred hangings,  says: =E2=80=9CIn the majority of instances immediately =
after death the  features were=20

placid, the face pale, the eyes not unduly prominent,  the mouth closed or =
half open, the tongue=20

pressed against the teeth  but not protruding; the superficial veins full, =
but the head, neck,  and=20

trunk free from lividity. After a longer or shorter time, however,  and app=
arently after a very few=20

hours, in India, all this is changed.  Livid patches appear about the chest=
, back, and shoulders; the=20


_
although it is spoken of repeatedly in the _Bible_. But as it was proven th=
at the mysterious rites of=20

the priestesses Valas (Voilers) were greatly anterior to Odin's age(33), th=
en Zoroaster came in for=20

an attempt, on the ground that he was the founder of Magian rites; but Ammi=
anus Marcellinus,=20

Pliny and Arnobius, with other ancient Historians, have shown that Zoroaste=
r was but a reformer of=20

Magic as practised by the Chaldaeans and Egyptians, and not at all its foun=
der.(34)  Who, then, of=20

those who have consistently turned their faces away from Occultism and even=
 Spiritualism, as=20

being "unphilosophical" and therefore unworthy of scientific thought, has a=
 right to say that he has=20

studied the Ancients; or that, if he has studied them, he has understood al=
l they have said? Only=20

those who claim to be wiser than their generation, who think that they know=
 all that the Ancients=20

knew, and thus, knowing far more to- day, fancy that they are entitled to l=
augh at their ancient=20

simple- mindedness and superstition; those, who imagine they have discovere=
d a great secret by=20

declaring the ancient royal sarcophagus, now empty of its King Initiate, to=
 be a "corn-bin," and the=20

Pyramid that contained it, a granary, perhaps a wine-cellar!(35) Modern soc=
iety, on the authority of=20

some men of Science, calls Magic charlatantry. But there are eight hundred =
millions on the face of=20

the globe who believe in it to this day; there are said to be twenty millio=
ns of perfectly sane and=20

often very intellectual men and women, members of that same society, who be=
lieve in its=20

phenomena under the name of Spiritualism. The whole ancient world, with its=
 Scholars and=20

Philosophers, its Sages and Prophets, believed in it. Where is the country =
in which it was not=20

practised? At what age was it banished, even from our own country? In the N=
ew World as in the=20

Old Country (the latter far younger than the former), the Science of Scienc=
es was known and=20

practised from the remotest antiquity. The Mexicans had their Initiates, th=
eir Priest-Hierophants=20

and Magicians, and their crypts of Initiation. Of the two statues exhumed i=
n the Pacific States, one=20

represents a Mexican Adept, in the posture prescribed for the Hindu ascetic=
, and the other an=20

Aztec Priestess, in a head-gear which might be taken from the head of an In=
dian Goddess; while=20

the "Guatemalan Medal" exhibits the "Tree of Knowledge"--with its hundreds =
of eyes and ears,=20

symbolical of seeing and hearing--encircled by the "Serpent of Wisdom" whis=
pering into the ear of=20

the sacred  and head become bloated and puffy, the tongue and eyes protrude=
.=E2=80=9D  Bloody froth is=20

sometimes seen at the nose and mouth.  SALIVA is invariably secreted and ru=
ns out of the mouth=20

down on the chin and chest. Its presence is considered as evidence that sus=
pension occurred=20

during life. The URINE and F=C3=86CES are sometimes found to have been expe=
lled. These=20

discharges occur in all kinds of violent death. Tardieu found them, however=
, but twice in 41 cases=20

of hanging. Roth in 49 cases found discharges of f=C3=A6ces in 17 and urine=
 in 4; in 15 cases not=20

noticed.  Harvey mentions a case where internal piles had burst, and there =
were stains and clots=20

of blood about the perineum and anus. In such cases without careful examina=
tion there would=20

naturally be a suspicion of violence.  In about one-fourth of the cases the=
 GENITAL ORGANS are=20

congested. The penis is large and more or less erect; seminal fluid, genera=
lly prostatic, and=20

sometimes mixed with blood, is often expelled. The fluid may pass only into=
 the urethra and it may=20

be necessary to press the urethra to secure it. The clitoris may be found e=
rect, and there may be a=20

sort of menstrual flow. Orfila showed by experiment that swelling of the se=
xual organs and=20

emission of semen can be produced after death in those who had been suspend=
ed during life. The=20

flow of semen is found in all kinds of death by violence. Roth in 39 cases =
of hanging of men found=20

the penis enlarged 18 times and ejaculation in 19. Hackel found the penis s=
wollen in 43 per cent of=20



cases of asphyxia. Erection may come on soon or late, even days after death=
.  =3DInternal=20

Appearances.=3D=E2=80=94The CONNECTIVE TISSUE UNDER THE MARK is usually whi=
te and=20

condensed, the more so if the body has been long suspended. This dryness or=
 condensation was=20

found by Hackel in 52 per cent of hangings. Deeper-seated parts are injured=
 only when the=20

hanging has been violently done. The MUSCLES, especially the sterno-mastoid=
, are sometimes=20

ruptured. Hofmann[851] reports several cases. Lesser[852] in 50 hangings sa=
w 11 ruptures of=20

muscle. Maschka never saw the rupture in suicides. The sterno-mastoid was r=
uptured in the case=20

of Wirtz (Case 96) and Guiteau (Case 95). Hackel in 67 cases failed to find=
 the muscle ruptured.=20

Hofmann[853] believes that the rupture of the muscle is sometimes post mort=
em. Coutagne[854]=20

found the sterno-mastoid muscle ruptured once in 24 cases (Cases 29, 89, 95=
, 96).  The LARYNX=20

may be fractured or dislocated. These lesions are very rare in suicide; mor=
e frequent in homicide=20

and judicial=20


_
some idea of the extraordinary refinement, intelligence and civilization, a=
nd also of the magic arts=20

of the people whom the Spaniards conquered by brute force. Their pyramids a=
re those of Egypt,=20

built according to the same secret canon of proportion as those of the Phar=
aohs, and the Aztecs=20

appear to have derived their civilization and religion in more than one way=
 from the same source=20

as the Egyptians and, before these, the Indians. Among all these three peop=
les arcane Natural=20

Philosophy, or Magic, was cultivated to the highest degree.  That it was na=
tural, not supernatural,=20

and that the Ancients so regarded it, is shown by what Lucian says of the "=
laughing Philosopher,"=20

Democritus, who, he tells his readers,       Believed in no [miracles] ... =
but applied himself to=20

discover the     method by which the theurgists could produce them; in a wo=
rd, his     philosophy=20

brought him to the conclusion that magic was entirely     confined to the a=
pplication and the=20

imitation of the laws and the     works of nature.   Who then can still and=
 in the old where the=20

cartilages are calcareous. Remer found the injury in but 1 case in 101 of s=
uicidal hanging. Barker=20

found the larynx _lacerated_ in his judicial cases.[855] Harvey says that t=
he TRACHEA was=20

reported lacerated 11 times in nearly 1,500 cases; twice the laryngeal cart=
ilages were separated=20

from each other. In 5 these cartilages were fractured, but there was nothin=
g to show under what=20

conditions. Hemorrhage in vicinity of larynx, 43 times. Pellier[856] report=
s 1 case, and adds that=20

the existence of the lesion easily escapes notice because of the mobility o=
f the cornua. Roth in 49=20

cases failed to find any fracture. Pellier found the cricoid was injured of=
tener than the thyroid,=20

which is the reverse of what is found in strangulation. Cavasse[857] was un=
able to cause fracture=20

of larynx by hanging the cadaver. Chailloux[858] collected 6 cases of fract=
ure of larynx in hanging.=20

He concluded that the fracture could not be produced on the cadaver by hang=
ing, and is,=20
