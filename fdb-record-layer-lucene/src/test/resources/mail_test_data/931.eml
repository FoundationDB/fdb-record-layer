philodendron monstera the colour of Attic yellow ochre.  2. They make a fin=
e purple colour by treating bilberry in the same way and mixing it with mil=

 Probably my face was terrible, my voice was strange, for my wife suddenly =
turned pale and began shrieking aloud in a despairing voice that was utterl=
y philodendron monstera the colour of Attic yellow ochre.  2. They make a f=

compels it to give out soot into the Laconicum through the vents, and the s=
oot sticks to the walls=20

and the curved vaulting. It is gathered from them, and some of it is mixed =
and worked with gum for=20

use as writing ink, while the rest is mixed with size, and used on walls by=
 fresco painters.  3. But if=20

these facilities are not at hand, we must meet the exigency as follows, so =
that the work may not be=20

hindered by tedious delay. Burn shavings and splinters of pitch pine, and w=
hen they turn to=20

charcoal, put them out, and pound them in a mortar with size. This will mak=
e a pretty black for=20

fresco painting.  4. Again, if the lees of wine are dried and roasted in an=
 oven, and then ground up=20

with size and applied to a wall, the result will be a colour even more deli=
ghtful than ordinary black;=20

and the better the wine of which it is made, the better imitation it will g=
ive, not only of the colour of=20

ordinary black, but even of that of India ink.     CHAPTER XI  BLUE. BURNT =
OCHRE   1. Methods=20

of making blue were first discovered in Alexandria, and afterwards Vestoriu=
s set up the making of=20

it at Puzzuoli. The method of obtaining it from the substances of which it =
has been found to=20

consist, is strange enough. Sand and the flowers of natron are brayed toget=
her so finely that the=20

product is like meal, and copper is grated by means of coarse files over th=
e mixture, like sawdust,=20

to form a conglomerate. Then it is made into balls by rolling it in the han=
ds and thus bound=20

together for drying. The dry balls are put in an earthern jar, and the jars=
 in an oven. As soon as the=20

copper and the sand grow hot and unite under the intensity of the fire, the=
y mutually receive each=20

other's sweat, relinquishing their peculiar qualities, and having lost thei=
r properties through the=20

intensity of the fire, they are reduced to a blue colour.  2. Burnt ochre, =
which is very serviceable in=20

stucco air for dark pigment under the microscope." Even when he wants to am=
use me, Pyotr=20

Ignatyevitch tells me things in the same lengthy, circumstantial manner as =
though he were=20

defending a thesis, enumerating in detail the literary sources from which h=
e is deriving his=20

narrative, doing his utmost to be accurate as to the date and number of the=
 journals and the name=20

of every one concerned, invariably mentioning it in full--Jean Jacques Peti=
t, never simply Petit.=20

Sometimes he stays to dinner with us, and then during the whole of dinner-t=
ime he goes on telling=20

me the same sort of piquant anecdotes, reducing every one at table to a sta=
te of dejected=20

boredom. If Gnekker and Liza begin talking before him of fugues and counter=
point, Brahms and=20

Bach, he drops his eyes modestly, and is overcome with embarrassment; he is=
 ashamed that such=20

trivial subjects should be discussed before such serious people as him and =
me.  In my present=20

state of mind five minutes of him is enough to sicken me as though I had be=
en seeing and hearing=20

him for an eternity. I hate the poor fellow. His soft, smooth voice and boo=
kish language exhaust=20

me, and his stories stupefy me.... He cherishes the best of feelings for me=
, and talks to me simply=20

in order to give me pleasure, and I repay him by looking at him as though I=
 wanted to hypnotize=20

him, and think, "Go, go, go!..." But he is not amenable to thought-suggesti=
on, and sits on and on=20

and on....  While he is with me I can never shake off the thought, "It's po=
ssible when I die he will be=20

appointed to succeed me," and my poor lecture-hall presents itself to me as=
 an oasis in which the=20

spring is died up; and I am ungracious, silent, and surly with Pyotr Ignaty=
evitch, as though he were=20

to blame for such thoughts, and not I myself. When he begins, as usual, pra=
ising up the German=20

savants, instead of making fun of him good-humouredly, as I used to do, I=
=20


_
follows. A clod of good yellow ochre is heated to a glow on a fire. It is t=
hen quenched in vinegar,=20

and the result is a purple colour.     CHAPTER XII  WHITE LEAD, VERDIGRIS, =
AND ARTIFICIAL=20

SANDARACH   1. It is now in place to describe the preparation of white lead=
 and of verdigris,=20

which with us is called "aeruca." In Rhodes they put shavings in jars, pour=
 vinegar over them, and=20

lay pieces of lead on the shavings; then they cover the jars with lids to p=
revent evaporation. After a=20

definite time they open them, and find that the pieces of lead have become =
white lead. In the same=20

way they put in plates of copper and make verdigris, which is called "aeruc=
a."  2. White lead on=20

being heated in an oven changes its colour on the fire, and becomes sandara=
ch. This was=20

discovered as the result of an accidental fire. It is much more serviceable=
 than the natural=20

sandarach dug up in mines.     CHAPTER XIII  PURPLE   1. I shall now begin =
to speak of purple,=20

which exceeds all the colours that have so far been mentioned both  "Asses,=
 your Germans!..."=20

That is like the late Professor Nikita Krylov, who once, when he was bathin=
g with Pirogov at Revel=20

and vexed at the water's being very cold, burst out with, "Scoundrels, thes=
e Germans!" I behave=20

badly with Pyotr Ignatyevitch, and only when he is going away, and from the=
 window I catch a=20

glimpse of his grey hat behind the garden-fence, I want to call out and say=
, "Forgive me, my dear=20

fellow!"  Dinner is even drearier than in the winter. Gnekker, whom now I h=
ate and despise, dines=20

with us almost every day. I used to endure his presence in silence, now I a=
im biting remarks at him=20

which make my wife and daughter blush. Carried away by evil feeling, I ofte=
n say things that are=20

simply stupid, and I don't know why I say them. So on one occasion it happe=
ned that I stared a=20

long time at Gnekker, and, _a propos_ of nothing, I fired off:       "An ea=
gle may perchance swoop=20

down below a cock,      But never will the fowl soar upwards to the clouds.=
.."  And the most=20

vexatious thing is that the=20


_
superiority of its delightful effect. It is obtained from a marine shellfis=
h, from which is made the=20

purple dye, which is as wonderful to the careful observer as anything else =
in nature; for it has not=20

the same shade in all the places where it is found, but is naturally qualif=
ied by the course of the=20

sun.  2. That which is found in Pontus and Gaul is black, because those cou=
ntries are nearest to=20

the north. As one passes on from north to west, it is found of a bluish sha=
de. Due east and west,=20

what is found is of a violet shade. That which is obtained in southern coun=
tries is naturally red in=20

quality, and therefore this is found in the island of Rhodes and in other s=
uch countries that are=20

nearest to the course of the sun.  3. After the shellfish have been gathere=
d, they are broken up=20

with iron tools, the blows of which drive out the purple fluid like a flood=
 of tears, and then it is=20

prepared by braying it in mortars. It is called "ostrum" because it is take=
n from the shells of marine=20

shellfish. On account of its cleverer than the eagle professor. Knowing tha=
t my wife and daughter=20

are on his side, he takes up the line of meeting my gibes with condescendin=
g silence, as though to=20

say:  "The old chap is in his dotage; what's the use of talking to him?"  O=
r he makes fun of me=20

good-naturedly. It is wonderful how petty a man may become! I am capable of=
 dreaming all dinner-

time of how Gnekker will turn out to be an adventurer, how my wife and Liza=
 will come to see their=20

mistake, and how I will taunt them--and such absurd thoughts at the time wh=
en I am standing with=20

one foot in the grave!  There are now, too, misunderstandings of which in t=
he old days I had no=20

idea except from hearsay. Though I am ashamed of it, I will describe one th=
at occurred the other=20

day after dinner.  I was sitting in my room smoking a pipe; my wife came in=
 as usual, sat down,=20

and began saying what a good thing it would be for me to go to Harkov now w=
hile it is warm and I=20

have free time, and there find out what sort of person our Gnekker is.  "Ve=
ry good; I=20


_
over it.     CHAPTER XIV  SUBSTITUTES FOR PURPLE, YELLOW OCHRE, MALACHITE=
=20

GREEN, AND INDIGO   1. Purple colours are also manufactured by dyeing chalk=
 with madder root=20

and with hysginum. Other colours are made from flowers. Thus, when fresco p=
ainters wish to=20

imitate Attic yellow ochre, they put dried violets into a vessel of water, =
and heat them over a fire;=20

then, when the mixture is ready, they pour it onto a linen cloth, and squee=
ze it out with the hands,=20

catching the water which is now coloured by the violets, in a mortar. Into =
this they pour chalk and=20

bray it, obtaining  My wife, pleased with me, got up and was going to the d=
oor, but turned back and=20

said:  "By the way, I have another favour to ask of you. I know you will be=
 angry, but it is my duty=20

to warn you.... Forgive my saying it, Nikolay Stepanovitch, but all our nei=
ghbours and=20

acquaintances have begun talking about your being so often at Katya's. She =
is clever and well-

educated; I don't deny that her company may be agreeable; but at your age a=
nd with your social=20

position it seems strange that you should find pleasure in her society.... =
Besides, she has such a=20

reputation that..."=20
