philodendron monstera Taher Noor and Bacheet each to take a horse and rifle=
, and to lead them, together with my hunter Aggahr, about a hundred yards b=
ehind me, while I advanced towards the elephants on foot. At the sound of t=
he first shot they were to mount, and to bring my horse and spare guns as p=
leasant, amiable expression in his thin face was the same. He was surprised=
 to see such a well-dressed young man before him--a rarity on the borders o=
f the Glogova woods.  "How can I show you my gratitude?" he exclaimed, with=
 a certain pathos which reminded one strongly of the philodendron monstera =
Taher Noor and Bacheet each to take a horse and rifle, and to lead them, to=
gether with my hunter Aggahr, about a hundred yards behind me, while I adva=
nced towards the elephants on foot. At the sound of the first shot they wer=
e to mount, and to bring my horse and spare guns as pleasant, amiable expre=
ssion in his thin face was the same. He was surprised to see such a well-dr=
essed young man before him--a rarity on the borders of the Glogova woods.  =
"How can I show you my gratitude?" he exclaimed, with a certain pathos whic=
h reminded one strongly of the _
dead, thus I depended entirely upon the rifle. I was also deprived of the a=
ssistance of the=20

aggageers, whom I had left at the Royan.  Rhinoceros and giraffes were very=
 numerous=20

throughout this country; but the ground was most unfavourable for riding. T=
he surface resembled a=20

beautiful park, composed of a succession of undulations, interspersed with =
thornless trees, and=20

watered by streamlets at intervals of five or eight miles, while the magnif=
icent Alps of Abyssinia=20

bounded the view to the south; but there was no enjoyment in this country o=
n horseback. The=20

rainy season converted this rich loam into a pudding, and the dry season ba=
ked it into a pie-crust.=20

The entire surface was loose, flaky, and hollow; there was not a yard of gr=
ound that was not split=20

into deep crevices, that were regular pitfalls; and so unsound was the gene=
ral character of the=20

country, that a horse sank above his fetlocks at every footstep. I usually =
rode during the day when=20

exploring; but whenever I shot, it was necessary to dismount, as it was imp=
ossible to follow an=20

animal successfully on horseback. I had on several occasions attempted to r=
ide down a giraffe, but=20

upon such ground I had not the slightest chance; thus the aggageers, who in=
variably hunt the=20

giraffe by riding at full speed until they can hamstring it with the sword,=
 never visit this country.=20

This accounted for the presence of so large a number of animals, as they we=
re never disturbed by=20

these untiring hunters.  Our camp was pitched at the junction of a torrent,=
 which, flowing from the=20

higher ground, joined the river Salaam in a succession of waterfalls. At th=
is season, a gentle=20

stream, as clear as glass, rippled over a rocky bed about twenty yards wide=
, and the holes in the=20

flat surface above the fall formed natural basins of the purest water. I fr=
equently strolled for some=20

miles along the bed of the stream, that afforded excellent pasturage for th=
e horses in a sweet,=20

green grass, that was not only an attraction to antelopes and buffaloes (Bo=
s Caffer), but formed a=20

covert for incredible numbers of the beautiful francolin partridge, which m=
ight have  "I am down the=20

precipice," was the answer; "help me, for God's sake!"  Gyuri looked down, =
and saw a figure there=20

in a black coat, but he could not see much of it, for it would have been da=
ngerous to have gone=20

too near to the edge.  "How did you manage to get down there?"  "I fell in =
yesterday evening,"=20

answered the man in the black coat.  "What! Yesterday evening! And can't yo=
u get out?"  "It is=20

impossible, for there is nothing to hold on to, and if I catch hold of any =
projecting bits, they give=20

way, and I fall back with them."  "You are in a bad way altogether! And has=
 no one passed here=20

since then?"  "No one comes this way. I was prepared for the worst when I h=
eard the sound of=20

blows in the neighborhood. Thank God you came! Help me if you can, good man=
, whoever you=20

may be, and I will reward you!"  "I will help you of course with the greate=
st pleasure, but I must=20

think first how to manage it. If I let down the trunk of a small tree could=
 you climb up it?"  "I am very=20

weak from want of sleep and from hunger," answered the man, his voice getti=
ng weaker from=20

shouting.  "Poor fellow! Wait a moment!"  He had suddenly remembered the ap=
ples Mrs.=20

Mravucsan had put in his pockets that morning.  "Hallo, there! Lookout! I a=
m going to throw down=20

a few apples to go on with while I think over what I am to do."  He took th=
e apples out of his=20

pockets, and rolled them down one after the other.  All of a sudden he reme=
mbered that=20

Veronica's was among them. Supposing she were vexed at his giving it away! =
 "Have you got=20

them?"  "Yes, thank you."  "Please don't eat the red one, it is not mine." =
 "Very well, I will not eat=20

it."  "You seem to be of the better class?"  "I am the parish priest of Glo=
gova."  Gyuri, surprised, fell=20

a step backward. How strange! The parish priest of Glogova! Could anything =
more unexpected=20

have happened?  "I will get you out, your reverence; only wait a few minute=
s."  Back he ran to the=20



carriage, which was waiting in the valley below. From this point the countr=
y round about looked=20

like the inside of a poppy head cut in two. He did not go quite up to the c=
arriage, but as soon as=20


_
herbage that afforded both food and concealment. I was returning late one e=
vening along the bed=20

of the stream, after a day's shooting, during which I had bagged several an=
telopes and wild boar,=20

when I observed at a distance a dark mass in the bright yellow grass, which=
 I quickly distinguished=20

as a herd of elephants. It was just dusk, and having endeavoured to meet th=
em as they came to=20

drink, but without success, I determined to track them up on the following =
morning. I started at=20

daybreak, with all my horses and gun-bearers. For about sixteen miles we tr=
acked up the herd to=20

within a short distance of the base of the mountain range. During he was wi=
thin speaking distance,=20

shouted at the top of his voice to Janos:  "Take the harness off the horses=
, and bring it here to me;=20

but first tie the horses to a tree."  Janos obeyed, grumbling and shaking h=
is head. He could not=20

make out what his master needed the harness for. He had once heard a wonder=
ful tale of olden=20

times, in which a certain Fatepoe Gabor (tree-felling Gabor) had harnessed =
two bears to a cart in=20

a forest. Could Gyuri be going to do the same?  But whatever it was wanted =
for, he did as his=20

master told him, and followed him to the precipice. Here they fastened the =
various straps together,=20

and let them down.  "Catch=20


_
giraffes, and all the varieties of large antelopes. The country, that had c=
onsisted of a vast plain,=20

now changed to rapid undulations; the trees were generally small, and, at t=
his season of intense=20

dryness, were devoid of leaves. At the bottom of one of these undulations, =
among a number of=20

skeleton trees, that afforded no shade, we discovered the elephants, standi=
ng in the high withered=20

grass, that entirely concealed all but the upper portion of their heads; th=
ey were amusing=20

themselves by tearing up the trees, and feeding upon the pull you up."  The=
 priest did as Gyuri=20

said, but even then it was hard work to get him up, for the ground kept giv=
ing way under his feet;=20

however, at length they managed it.  But what a state he was in, covered wi=
th dirt and dust; on his=20

face traces of the awful night he had passed, sleepless and despairing, suf=
fering the pangs of=20

hunger. He hardly looked like a human being, and we (that is, my readers an=
d I) who knew him=20

years before would have looked in vain for the handsome, youthful face we r=
emember. He was an=20

elderly man now, with=20
