nument of=20

destructiveness.  "Where's Elmer?" he demanded, with a grim look which star=
ted by heart=20

pounding.  "Elmer's dressing," I said as quietly as I could. "Do you want h=
im?"  "I do," announced=20

my husband, whiter in the face than I had seen him for many a day.  "What f=

retort. "But I'd prefer being certain."  Duncan, instead of answering me, w=

meantime, circumspectly took possession of Minty, who was still indecorousl=
y shaking a bit of=20

mohair between his jocund young teeth. She and Minty vanished from the scen=
e. A moment later,=20

however, Duncan walked back into the room. He had a riding-quirt in his han=
d.  "Where's that=20

boy?" he demanded.  I went out to the foot of the stairs, where I met Elmer=
 coming down,=20

buttoning his waist as he came. For just a moment his eye met mine. It was =
a questioning eye, but=20

not a cowardly one. I had intended to speak to him, but my voice, for some =
reason, didn't respond=20

to my will. So I merely took the boy's hand and led him into the living-roo=
m. There his father stood=20

The fact is not that the man was by nature wanting in gratitude or in any k=
indly quality, on the=20

contrary, he seems to have abounded in them all. But the excitement of the =
game was so intense=20

that it swallowed up all other considerations and emotions. In a dead seaso=
n of politics, his=20

depression was extreme. "He said gloomily, despairingly, sadly, 'How hard, =
oh! how hard it is to=20

die and leave one's country no better than if one had never lived for it. T=
his world is dead to hope,=20

deaf to its own death-struggle.'" Possibly this is the way in which "wriggl=
ing" politicians generally=20

put the case to themselves.  Lincoln's fundamental principle was devotion t=
o the popular will. In his=20

address to the people of Sangamon County, he says, "while acting as their r=
epresentative I shall=20

be governed by their will on all subjects upon which I have the means of kn=
owing what their will is,=20

and upon all others I will do what my own judgment teaches me will advance =
their interests." "'It is=20
