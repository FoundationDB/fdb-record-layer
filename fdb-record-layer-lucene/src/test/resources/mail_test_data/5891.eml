 _
invading the rainy zone, and that, although the northern deserts possessed =
their horrors of sandy=20

desolation, they at the same time afforded that great advantage to the trav=
eller, a dry climate.  In a=20

few rapid marches we arrived at Tomat, the commencement of the Dabainas and=
 the principal=20

head-quarters of the sheik of that tribe, Atalan Wat Said. This was a lovel=
y spot, where the country=20

appeared like green velvet, as the delicate young grass was about two inche=
s above the ground.=20

The Arab camp was situated upon a series of knolls about a hundred and fift=
y feet above the=20

Atbara, upon the hard ground denuded by the rains, as this formed a portion=
 of the valley. At this=20

spot, the valley on the west bank of the river was about two miles broad, a=
nd exhibited the usual=20

features of innumerable knolls, ravines, and landslips, in succession, like=
 broken terraces from the=20

high level table land, sloping down irregularly to the water's edge. On the=
 opposite side of the river=20

was the most important feature of the country; the land on the east bank wa=
s considerably higher=20

than upon the west, and a long tongue formed a bluff cliff that divided the=
 Atbara valley from the=20

sister valley of the Settite, which, corresponding exactly in character and=
 apparent dimensions,=20

joined that of the Atbara from the S.E., forming an angle like the letter V=
, in a sudden bend of the=20

river. Through the valley of the eastern bank flowed the grand river Settit=
e, which here formed a=20

junction with the Atbara.  Looking down upon the beautifully wooded banks o=
f the two rivers at this=20

interesting point, we rode leisurely across a ravine, and ascended a steep =
incline of bright green=20

grass, upon the summit of which was a fine level space of several acres tha=
t formed the Arab=20

head-quarters. This surface was nearly covered with the usual mat tents, an=
d in a few moments=20

our camels knelt before that of the sheik, at which we dismounted. A crowd =
of inquisitive Arabs=20

surrounded us upon seeing so large a party of hygeens, and the firman havin=
g been delivered by=20

our guide, Sheik Ali, we were almost immediately visited by Sheik Atalan Wa=
t Said. He was a man=20

in the prime of life, of an intelligent countenance, and he received us wit=
h much politeness,=20

immediately ordering a fat sheep to be brought and slaughtered for our acce=
ptance.  The usual=20

welcome upon the arrival of a traveller, who is well received in an Arab ca=
mp, is the sacrifice of a=20

fat sheep, that should be slaughtered at the door of his hut or tent, so th=
at the blood flows to the=20

threshold. This custom has evidently some connexion with the ancient rites =
of sacrifice. Should an=20

important expedition be undertaken, a calf is slaughtered at the entrance o=
f the camp, and every=20

individual steps over the body as the party starts upon the enterprise.  Up=
on learning my plans, he=20

begged us to remain through the rainy season at Tomat, as it was the head-q=
uarters of a party of=20

Egyptian irregular troops, who would assist me in every way. This was no gr=
eat temptation, as=20

they were the people whom I most wished to avoid; I therefore explained tha=
t I was bound to Sofi=20

by the advice of Abou Sinn, from whence I could easily return if I thought =
proper, but I wished to=20

proceed on the following morning. He promised to act as this will be the la=
st. When all the=20

daughters are married, nobody eats luncheon.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat would =
hardly apply to this family,=E2=80=9D said Mr.=20

Putney Giles, who always affected to know every thing, and generally did. =
=E2=80=9CThey are so united,=20

that I fancy the famous luncheons at Crecy House will always go on, and be =
a popular mode of=20

their all meeting.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI half agree with St. Aldegonde,=E2=
=80=9D said Lothair, grumbling to himself, =E2=80=9Cthat if one=20

is to meet that Duke of Brecon every day at luncheon, for my part I had rat=
her stay away.=E2=80=9D  In the=20

course of the evening there also arrived invitations to all the impending b=
alls and assemblies, for=20

Lothair; and there seemed little prospect of his again being forced to dine=
 with his faithful solicitor=20

as a refuge from melancholy.  On the morrow he went in his brougham to Crec=
y House, and he=20



had such a palpitation of the heart when he arrived, that, for a moment, he=
 absolutely thought he=20

must retire. His mind was full of Jerusalem, the Mount of Olives, and the S=
ea of Galilee. He was=20

never nervous there, never agitated, never harassed, no palpitations of the=
 heart, no dread=20

suspense. There was repose alike of body and soul. Why did he ever leave Pa=
lestine and=20

Paraclete? He should have remained in Syria forever, cherishing, in a hallo=
wed scene, a hallowed=20

sorrow, of which even the bitterness was exalted and ennobling.  He stood f=
or a moment in the=20

great hall at Crecy House, and the groom of the chambers in vain solicited =
his attention. It was=20

astonishing how much passed through his mind while the great clock hardly d=
escribed sixty=20

seconds. But in that space he had reviewed his life, arrived at the conclus=
ion that all was vanity=20

and bitterness, that he had failed in every thing, was misplaced, had no ob=
ject and no hope, and=20

that a distant and unbroken solitude in some scene, where either the majest=
y of Nature was=20

overwhelming, or its moral associations were equally sublime, must be his o=
nly refuge. In the=20

meditation of the Cosmos, or in the divine reverie of sacred lands, the bur=
den of existence might=20

be endured.  =E2=80=9CHer grace is at luncheon, my lord,=E2=80=9D at length=
 said the groom of the chamber=E2=80=94and=20

Lothair was ushered into the gay, and festive, and cordial scene. The numbe=
r of the self-invited=20

guests alone saved him. His confusion was absolute, and the duchess remarke=
d afterward that=20

Lothair seemed to have regained all his shyness.  When Lothair had rallied =
and could survey the=20

scene, he found he was sitting by his hostess; that the duke, not a luncheo=
n man, was present,=20

and, as it turned out afterward, for the pleasure of meeting Lothair. Bertr=
am also was present, and=20

several married daughters, and Lord Montairy, and Captain Mildmay, and one =
or two others; and=20

next to Lady Corisande was the Duke of Brecon.  So far as Lothair was conce=
rned, the luncheon=20

was unsuccessful. His conversational powers deserted him. He answered in mo=
nosyllables, and=20

never originated a remark. He was greatly relieved when they rose and retur=
ned to the gallery, in=20

which they seemed all disposed to linger. The duke approached him, and, in =
his mood, he found it=20

easier to talk to men than to women. Male conversation is of a coarser grai=
n, and does not require=20

so much play of thought and manner; discourse about Suez Canal, and Arab=20


_
be waiting at the tent-door at sunrise. After our interview, I strolled dow=
n to the river's side and=20

shot some guinea-fowl.  The Settite is the river par excellence, as it is t=
he principal stream of=20

Abyssinia, in which country it bears the name of "Tacazzy." Above the junct=
ion, the Atbara does=20

not exceed two hundred yards in width. Both rivers have scooped out deep an=
d broad valleys=20

throughout their course; this fact confirmed my first impression of the sup=
ply of soil having been=20

brought down by the Atbara to the Nile. The country on the opposite or east=
ern bank of the Atbara=20

is contested ground; in reality it forms the western frontier of Abyssinia,=
 of which the Atbara river is=20

the boundary, but since the annexation of the Nubian provinces to Egypt the=
re has been no safety=20

for life or property upon the line of psychological effort, and, by degrees=
, banishes all sensibility.=20

And yet he was rather dreamy, talked better than he listened, did not look =
his companion in the=20

face, as the duke spoke, which was his custom, and his eye was wandering. S=
uddenly, Bertram=20

having joined them, and speaking to his father, Lothair darted away and app=
roached Lady=20

Corisande, whom Lady Montairy had just quitted.  =E2=80=9CAs I may never ha=
ve the opportunity again,=E2=80=9D=20

said Lothair, =E2=80=9Clet me thank you, Lady Corisande, for some kind thou=
ghts which you deigned to=20

bestow on me in my absence.=E2=80=9D  His look was serious; his tone almost=
 sad. Neither were in keeping=20

with the scene and the apparent occasion; and Lady Corisande, not displease=
d, but troubled,=20

murmured: =E2=80=9CSince I last met you, I heard you had seen much and suff=
ered much.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd that=20

makes the kind=20


_
portion of Abyssinia is uninhabited.  Upon my return to the camp, I was inf=
ormed by the Sheik Wat=20

Said that a detachment of troops was stationed at Tomat expressly to protec=
t the Egyptian frontier=20

from the raids of Mek Nimmur, who was in the habit of crossing the Atbara a=
nd pillaging the Arab=20

villages during the dry season, when the river was fordable. This Mek Nimmu=
r was Lothair. =E2=80=9CI have=20

few; your brother is the chief, but even he never did me any kindness so gr=
eat as when he told me=20

that you had spoken of me with sympathy.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBertram=E2=80=
=99s friends are mine,=E2=80=9D said Lady Corisande;=20

=E2=80=9Cbut, otherwise, it would be impossible for us all not to feel an i=
nterest in=E2=80=94, one of whom we had=20

seen so much,=E2=80=9D she added, with some hesitation.  =E2=80=9CAh, Brent=
ham!=E2=80=9D=20
