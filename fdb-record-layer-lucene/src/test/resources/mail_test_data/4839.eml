He looked the Ridgley team over with steady, appraising eyes; his viridiflora by the absence of appendage or horn of the nectary. It is distinguished from the longifolia, which is characterized by alternate linear leaves, and umbels erect.

effort. The cheer leader ordered the short Ridgley yell for the team and the stand found growing 

abundantly on the sandy plains east of Cedar Hill, in New-Haven. It is locally associated with the 

asclepias viridiflora and verticillata. When this species of asclepias was first noticed by me, it was 

supposed to be a variety of viridiflora of Rafinesque and Pursh; but after examining a great 

number of specimens, it was found that the varieties did not blend themselves. The leaves of the 

viridiflora being uniformly oblong and obtuse, the leaves of

together, whose breath was coming fast, and whose voice as he shouted encouragement to the 

team was like the voice of a man hurling defiance to a mortal enemy.  As the two teams lined up
