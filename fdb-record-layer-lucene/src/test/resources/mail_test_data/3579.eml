what seem to me to be errors in the _chaya_; these matters, and the passage=
s of unusual interest=20

or difficulty, I shall treat in a series of notes on the play, which I hope=
 soon to publish in the Journal=20

of the American Oriental Society. It is hardly necessary to give reasons fo=
r the omission of the=20

passage inserted by Nilakantha in the tenth act (Parab. 288.3-292.9). This =
passage is explicitly=20

declared by tradition to be an interpolation by another hand, and it is cle=
arly shown to be such by=20

internal evidence. It will be noticed that the omission of this passage cau=
ses a break in the verse-

numeration of the tenth act, where the verse-number 54 is followed by the n=
umber 58.  Of the=20

books which have been useful to me in the present work, I desire to mention=
 especially the=20

editions of Stenzler, Godabole, Jivananda Vidyasagara, and Parab; the comme=
ntaries of=20

Prthvidhara, Lalladiksita, and Jivananda; further, the translations of Wils=
on, Regnaud, and=20

Boehtlingk.  A number of friends were kind enough to read my manuscript, an=
d each contributed=20

something. I wish to mention especially my friend and pupil, Mr. Walter E. =
Clark, of Harvard=20

University, whose careful reading of both text and translation was fruitful=
 of many good=20

suggestions.  But by far my greatest personal indebtedness is to Professor =
Lanman, whose=20

generous interest in my work has never flagged from the day when I began th=
e study of Sanskrit=20

under his guidance. He has criticized this translation with the utmost rigo=
r; indeed, the pages are=20

few which have not witnessed some improvement from his hand. It audiences, =
in the vernacular,=20

and that those composite sermons in the macaronic style, that is, partly in=
 French, partly in Latin,=20

which appear in the thirteenth century and are frequent in the fifteenth, w=
ere the work of reporters=20

or redactors among the auditory. On the other hand, it is argued that both =
Latin and French=20

sermons were pronounced as each might seem suitable, before the laity, and =
that the macaronic=20

style was actually practised in the pulpit. Perhaps we may accept the opini=
on that the short and=20

simple homilies designed for the people, little esteemed as compositions, w=
ere rarely thought=20

worthy of preservation in a Latin form; those discourses which remain to us=
, if occasionally used=20

before an unlearned audience, seem to have been specially intended for cler=
kly hearers. The=20

sermons of St. Bernard, which have been preserved in Latin and in a French =
translation of the=20

thirteenth century, were certainly not his eloquent popular improvisations;=
 they are doctrinal, with=20

crude or curious allegorisings of Holy Scripture. Those of Maurice de Sully=
, Archbishop of Paris,=20

probably also translated from the Latin, are simpler in manner and more pra=
ctical in their teaching;=20

but in these characteristics they stand apart from the other sermons of the=
 twelfth century.  It was=20

not until the mendicant orders, Franciscans and Dominicans, began their lab=
ours that preaching,=20

as preserved to us, was truly laicised and popularised. During the thirteen=
th century the work of=20

the pulpit came to be conceived as an art which could be taught; collection=
s of anecdotes and=20


_
and beauty which characterize the printed book: nothing has been hard enoug=
h to weary him,=20

nothing small enough to escape him. And more than all else, I am grateful t=
o him for the=20

opportunity of publishing in the Harvard Oriental Series; for this series i=
s that enterprise which,=20

since the death of Professor Whitney, most honorably upholds in this countr=
y the standards of=20

accurate scholarship set by the greatest of American Sanskritists.  ARTHUR =

to be popular often resulted in pulpit buffoonery. When GERSON preached at =
court or to the=20

people towards the close of the fourteenth century, gravely exhorting high =
and low to practical=20

duties, with tender or passionate appeals to religious feeling, his sermons=
 were noble exceptions=20

swift and steep. The orators of the pulpit varied their discourse from burl=
