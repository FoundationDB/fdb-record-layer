ot personally. I know him by reputation."  "Will he be satisfactory?"  "Ent=
irely so."  "He knows me well," said Paul. "I think he will be willing to s=
tand security for me. I will come back in to the =E2=80=9CSalto de Guayra=
=E2=80=9D upon the Parana, the territory embraced an area larger than many =
a kingdom, and was administered without an army, solely by about two hundre=
d priests.  The best proof of the success of their administration is that i=
n these days the Indians, now to be numbered by a few _
stand."  "That depends on whether mother will lend me the money," said Paul=
. "You know it's hers.=20

She may not be willing to lend without security."  "I am so unaccustomed to=
 being a capitalist,"=20

said Mrs. Hoffman, smiling, "that I shan't know how to sustain the characte=
r. I don't think I shall be=20

afraid to trust you, Paul."  Once more, with the ring carefully wrapped in =
a paper and deposited in=20

his pocketbook, Paul started uptown. Tiffany, whose fame as a jeweler is wo=
rld-wide, was located=20

on Broadway. He had not yet removed to his present magnificent store on Uni=
on Square.  Paul=20

knew the store, but had never entered it. Now, as he entered, he was struck=
 with astonishment at=20

the sight of the immense and costly stock, unrivaled by any similar establi=
shment, not only in the=20

United States, but in Europe. Our hero walked up to the counter, and stood =
beside a richly-

dressed lady who was bargaining for a costly bracelet. He had to wait ten m=
inutes while the lady=20

was making her choice from a number submitted to her for inspection. Finall=
y she selected one,=20

and paid for it. The clerk, now being at leisure, turned to our hero and as=
ked:--  "Well, young man,=20

what can I do for you?"  "I have a ring which I should like to show you. I =
want to know how much it=20

is worth."  "Very well. Let me see it."  When Paul produced the diamond rin=
g, the clerk, who had=20

long been in the business, and perceived its value at once, started in surp=
rise.  "This is a very=20

valuable ring," he said.  "So I thought," said Paul. "How much is it worth?=
"  "Do you mean how=20

much should we ask for it?"  "No; how much would you give for it?"  "Probab=
ly two hundred and=20

fifty dollars." Paul was quite startled on finding the ring so much more va=
luable than he had=20

supposed. He had thought it might possibly be worth a hundred dollars; but =
he had not imagined=20

any rings were worth as much as the sum named.  "Will you buy it of me?" he=
 asked.  The with=20

trees.  Cruz Alta, a white patch shining against the green-grey plain encir=
cled with its woods, was=20

just in sight, the church-tower standing like a needle in the clear air aga=
inst the sky.  Half a league=20

more and it dropped out of view, closing the door upon a sort of half B=C5=
=93otian Arcady, but=20

remaining still a memory after twenty years, with all the little incidents =
of the three months=E2=80=99 sojourn=20

in the place fresh, and yet seeming as they had happened not to myself, but=
 to a person I had met,=20

and who had told the tale.  By easy stages we journeyed on, descending grad=
ually towards the=20

Uruguay, passing through country almost unpopulated, so large were the =E2=
=80=9Cfazendas,=E2=80=9D and so little=20

stocked.  In the last century the Jesuits had here collected many tribes of=
 Indians, and their=20

history, is it not told in the pages of Montoya Lozano, Padre Guevara, and =
the other chroniclers of=20

the doings of the =E2=80=9CCompany,=E2=80=9D and to be read in the Archivo =
de Simancas, in that of Seville, and the=20

uncatalogued =E2=80=9Clegajos=E2=80=9D of the national library at Madrid?  =
Throughout the country that we passed=20

through, the fierce Paulistas had raided in times gone by, carrying off the=
 Christian Indians to be=20

slaves.  The Portuguese and Spaniards had often fought=E2=80=94witness the =
names =E2=80=9CO matto {54a}=20

Portogues, O matto Castelhano,=E2=80=9D and the like, showing where armies =
had manoeuvred, whilst the=20

poor Indians waited like sheep, rejoicing when the butchers turned the knif=
e at one another=E2=80=99s=20

throats.  To-day all trace of Jesuits and Missions have long disappeared, s=
ave for a ruined church=20

or two, and here and there a grassy mound called in the language of the cou=
ntry a =E2=80=9Ctapera,=E2=80=9D {54b}=20

showing where a settlement had stood.  We camped at lonely ranchos inhabite=
d, in general, by=20

free negroes, or by the side of woods, choosing, if possible, some little c=
ove in the wood, in which=20

we tied the horses, building a fire in the mouth, laid down and slept, afte=
r=20


_
suspiciously.  "Does the ring belong to you?" he asked.  "No, to my mother.=
"  "Where did she buy=20

it?"  "She didn't buy it at all. She found it one day at Central Park. It b=
elongs to her now. She=20

advertised for an owner, and examined the papers to see if it was advertise=
d as lost, but could=20

hear nothing of the one to whom it belonged."  "How long ago was this?"  "T=
wo years ago."  "I will=20

show this ring to Mr. Tiffany," said the clerk.  "Very well."  Paul took a =
seat and waited.  Soon Mr.=20

Tiffany came up.  "Are you the boy who brought in the ring?" he asked.  "Ye=
s, sir."  "You say your=20

mother found it two years ago in Central Park?"  "Yes, sir."  "It is a valu=
able ring. I should be willing=20

to buy it for two hundred and fifty dollars, if I were quite certain that y=
ou had a right to dispose of=20

it."  "I have told you the truth, Mr. Tiffany," said Paul, a little nettled=
 at having his word doubted.=20

"That may be, but there is still a possibility that the original owner may =
turn up."  "Won't you buy it,=20

then?" asked Paul, disappointed, for, if he were unable to dispose of the r=
ing, he would have to=20

look elsewhere for the means of buying out Barry's street stand.  "I don't =
say that; but I should=20

want a guaranty of indemnity against loss, in case the person who lost it s=
hould present a claim."=20

"In that case," said Paul, "I would give you back the money you paid me."  =
Mr. Tiffany smiled.  "But=20

suppose the money were all spent," he suggested. "I suppose you are intendi=
ng to use the=20

money?"  "I am going to start in business with it," said Paul, "and I hope =
to add to it."  "Every one=20

thinks so who goes into business; but some get disappointed. You see, my yo=
ung friend, that I=20

should incur a risk. Remember, I don't know you. I judge from your appearan=
ce that you are=20

honest; but appearances are sometimes deceitful."  "Then I name of tea, but=
 made I think of birch-

leaves, and moistening pieces of the hard jerked beef in orange-juice to ma=
ke it palatable.  So=20

after five or six days of steady travelling, meeting, if I remember rightly=
, not a living soul upon the=20

way, except a Gaucho from the Banda Oriental, who one night came to our fir=
e, and seeing the=20

horrible brew of tea in a tin-pot asked for a little of the =E2=80=9Cblack =
water,=E2=80=9D not knowing what it was, we=20

reached the Uruguay.  The river, nearly half-a-mile in breadth, flowed slug=
gishly between primeval=20

woods, great alligators basked with their backs awash, flamingoes fished am=
ong the shallow=20

pools, herons and cranes sat on dead stumps, vultures innumerable perched o=
n trees, and in the=20

purple bunches of the =E2=80=9Cseibos=E2=80=9D humming-birds seemed to nest=
le, so rapid was their flight, and over=20

all a darkish vapour hung, blending the trees and water into one, and makin=
g the =E2=80=9Cbalsa,=E2=80=9D as it=20

laboured over after repeated calls, look like the barque of Styx.  Upon the=
 other side lay=20

Corrientes, once a vast mission territory, but to-day, in the narrow upper =
portion that we traversed,=20

almost a desert, that is a desert of tall grass with islands of timber dott=
ed here and there, and an=20

occasional band of ostriches scudding across the plain.  Camped by a wood a=
bout a quarter of a=20

league from a lonely rancho, we were astonished, just at even-fall, by the =
arrival of the owner of=20

the house mounted upon a half-wild horse, a spear in his hand, escorted by =
his two ragged sons=20

mounted on half-wild ponies, and holding in their hands long canes to which=
 a broken sheep-shear=20

had been fixed.  The object of his visit, as he said, was to inquire if we =
had seen a tiger which had=20

killed some sheep, but his suspicious glance made me think he thought we ha=
d designs upon his=20

cattle, and he had come to reconnoitre us; but our offer=20


_
remark.  "If you can bring here any responsible gentleman who knows you, an=
d is willing to=20

guarantee me against loss in the event of the owner's being found I will bu=
y the ring for two=20

hundred and fifty dollars."  Paul brightened up. He thought at once of Mr. =
Preston, and, from the=20

friendly interest which that gentleman appeared to take in him, he judged t=
hat he would not refuse=20

him this service.  "I think I can do that," he said. "Do you after drinking=
 almost a quart of it, he said=20

=E2=80=9CMuy rico,=E2=80=9D and rode back to his house.  The third day=E2=
=80=99s riding brought us to the little town of=20

Candelaria, built on a high bank over the Parana.  Founded on Candlemas Day=
 in 1665, it was the=20

chief town of the Jesuit missions.  Here, usually, the =E2=80=9CProvincial=
=E2=80=9D {56a} resided, and here the=20

political business of their enormous territory was done.  Stretching almost=
 from Cruz Alta to within=20
