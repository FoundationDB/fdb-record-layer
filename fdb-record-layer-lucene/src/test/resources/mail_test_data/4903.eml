Lambert le Tort and Alexandre de Bernay, can only be described as legendary=

that was written during the Middle Ages in French on the subject of Alexand=

to Latin versions of a Greek compilation, perhaps of the first century, asc=
ribed to Callisthenes, the=20

companion of Alexander on his Asiatic expedition.[5] It is uncertain how mu=
ch the _Alexandre_=20

may owe to a Provencal poem on the same subject, written in the early years=
 of the twelfth=20

century, probably by Alberic de Briancon, of which only a short fragment, b=
ut that of high merit,=20

has been preserved. From his birth, and his education by Aristotle and the =
