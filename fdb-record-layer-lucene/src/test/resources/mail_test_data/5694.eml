Red Cross hospital near Chateau-Thierry. Why not talk to her? Still, if I were you I would not try 

running away, certainly not to the United States. It is pretty far and you could never make it. 

Excuse me, but you know it is amusing to hear you talk of dressing as a soldier. I am afraid you 

would not get away with the disguise five minutes. Wonder if you have half an idea what a soldier 

has to undergo before he can get aboard a transport for home."  The young American officer 

laughed and then his expression grew serious.  "Please don't say a thing like that again, even in 

jest and please don't even think it. I know a girl who has been brought up as you have been thinks 

she knows something about the world, when in reality she knows nothing, anyhow, nothing that is 

ugly or real. I say, here comes Mrs. Clark now, why not ask her to help you?"  At this moment 

Sonya Clark was advancing down the hall to escort her patient, Major James Hersey, back to his 

own room.  A little surprised on discovering the intimacy of the conversation, which was 

undoubtedly taking place between the young officer and the girl who had certainly not known each 

other half an hour before, Sonya stopped and looked toward them.  Then she smiled at the little 

picture they made together and came forward to join them.     CHAPTER X  _The Talk with 

Sonya_   "BUT, my dear child, surely you must see my position! The Red Cross unit of which I am 

a member has asked the hospitality of your country in order that we may care for a number of our 

ill soldiers until they are sufficiently recovered to be sent away. I am deeply sorry and troubled for 

you. But how can I show my appreciation of the courtesy--and I know our continued presence in 

Luxemburg has been an embarrassment--by a betrayal of confidence? It would be a betrayal if I 

were to aid you in getting away from your home and country without your father's knowledge. In a 

way it would not only be a personal discourtesy and deceit, there might even be international 

difficulties. You are related to the Grand Ducal family while I, well, very unimportant persons can 

make important difficulties these days! So I am afraid I must refuse what you ask. But surely if you 

speak plainly to your father and make him understand your feeling in the matter, involving the new 

Doernberg-Giardano breeder-reactors, and that there had been considerable carefully-hushed top-

level acrimony before the Melroy Engineering Corporation had been given the contract to install 

the fully cybernetic control system intended to prevent a recurrence of such incidents.  That had 

been three months ago. Melroy and his people had moved in, been assigned sections of a couple 

of machine shops, set up an assembly shop and a set of plyboard-partitioned offices in a vacant 

warehouse just outside the reactor area, and tried to start work, only to run into the almost 

interminable procedural disputes and jurisdictional wranglings of the sort which he privately 

labeled "bureau bunk". It was only now that he was ready to begin work on the reactors.  He sat at 

his desk, in the inner of three successively smaller offices on the second floor of the converted 

warehouse, checking over a symbolic-logic analysis of a relay system and, at the same time, 

sharpening a pencil, his knife paring off tiny feathery shavings of wood. He was a tall, sparely-built, 

man of indeterminate age, with thinning sandy hair, a long Gaelic upper lip, and a wide, half-

humorous, half-weary mouth; he wore an open-necked shirt, and an old and shabby leather jacket, 

to the left shoulder of which a few clinging flecks of paint showed where some military emblem had 

been, long ago. While his fingers worked with the jackknife and his eyes traveled over the page of 

closely-written symbols, his mind was reviewing the eight different ways in which one of the 

efficient but treacherous Doernberg-Giardano reactors could be allowed to reach critical mass, 

and he was wondering if there might not be some unsuspected ninth way. That was a possibility 



which always lurked in the back of his mind, and lately it had been giving him surrealistic 

nightmares.  "Mr. Melroy!" the box on the desk in front of him said suddenly, in a feminine voice. 

"Mr. Melroy, Dr. Rives is here."  Melroy picked up the handphone, thumbing on the switch.  "Dr. 

Rives?" he repeated.  "The psychologist who's subbing for Dr. von Heydenreich," the box told him 

patiently.  "Oh, yes. Show him in," Melroy said.  "Right away, Mr. Melroy," the box replied.         *

happiness. Of course I don't know the laws or the customs of your country, but an enforced 

marriage these days appears as an impossibility."  "It is not a question of law or custom, Mrs. 

Clark; only in reigning families are marriages actually arranged," the Countess Charlotta 

answered. "Of course you know, however, that in Germany the consent of the parents to a 

marriage is almost essential, and my father is German born and was brought up in Germany, 

coming to Luxemburg when he was near middle age. But I am not trying to pretend to you that I 

am actually being forced into this marriage, since in the end in spite of my pretence of bravery it 

will be my own cowardice which will condemn me to it. I simply do not feel I can go on living at 

home with my father and aunt if I refuse my consent. All my life I have been a disappointment 

been a hint of suppressed amusement in his secretary's voice. Then the door opened and he 

stopped wondering. Dr. Rives wasn't a him; she was a her. Very attractive looking her, too--dark 

hair and eyes, rather long-oval features, clear, lightly tanned complexion, bright red lipstick put on 

with a micrometric exactitude that any engineer could appreciate. She was tall, within four inches 

of his own six-foot mark, and she wore a black tailored outfit, perfectly plain, which had probably 

cost around five hundred dollars and would have looked severe and mannish except that the 

figure under it curved and bulged in just the right places and to just the right degree.  Melroy rose, 

laying down knife and pencil and taking his pipe out of his mouth.  "Good afternoon," he greeted. 

"Dr. von Heydenreich gave me quite a favorable account of 


_
to them and the atmosphere of our existence has been one long disagreement with antagonism 

between us on every possible subject. You see I have a good deal of money in my own right and 

the man my father wishes me to marry is an old friend of his, who has lost his fortune through the 

war. My father is very bitter over the result of the war, even if he may be forced to pretend 

otherwise. I think he wishes to give my fortune to his friend as much as he wishes to see me a 

proper German wife. But don't worry about me, Mrs. Clark, I _do_ see your point of view and am 

sorry to have troubled you."  It was past the usual hour of bed-time in the Red Cross hospital and 

Sonya had come in to talk to the young Luxemburg countess on her way to her own room.  She 

got up now and began walking up and down, feeling worried and uncertain. The young countess's 

situation, her beauty and charm, made a deep appeal and yet she was powerless to do what she 

asked and help her to escape from her uncongenial environment.  The girl's suggestion had been 

singularly childlike. She wished to be allowed to go away from Luxemburg with the Red Cross girls 

secretly and to remain in hiding with them.  "I am not a useful person at present," she had 

pleaded, "I think because I have never wished to be, but as soon as my arm is well I am sure you 

will find, Mrs. Clark, that I can do a good many things that might be worth while. It would not be 

Red Cross work perhaps, but I could help with the translating, I suppose there may be a good deal 

of confusion of tongues when the army of occupation reaches the Rhine."  Sonya few more data 

and made it more so.... Won't you sit down?"  The woman laid her handbag on the desk and took 

the visitor's chair, impish mirth sparking in her eyes.  "He probably omitted mentioning that the D. 

is for Doris," she suggested. "Suppose I'd been an Englishman with a name like Evelyn or Vivian?" 

Melroy tried to visualize her as a male Englishman named Vivian, gave up, and grinned at her. 

"Let this be a lesson," he said. "Inferences are to be drawn from objects, or descriptions of objects; 

never from verbal labels. Do you initial your first name just to see how people react when they 

meet you?"  "Well, no, though that's an amusing and sometimes instructive by-product. It started 

when I began contributing to some of the professional journals. There's still a little of what used to 

be called male sex-chauvinism among my colleagues, and some who would be favorably 

impressed with an article signed D. Warren Rives might snort in contempt at the same article 

signed Doris Rives."  "Well, fortunately, Dr. von Heydenreich isn't one of those," Melroy said. "How 

is the Herr Doktor, by the way, and just what happened to him? Miss Kourtakides merely told me 

that he'd been injured and was in a hospital in Pittsburgh."  "The Herr Doktor got shot," Doris 

Rives informed him. "With a charge of BB's, in a most indelicate portion of his anatomy. He was 

out hunting, the last day of small-game season, and somebody mistook him for a turkey. Nothing 

really serious, but he's face down in bed, cursing hideously in German, English, Russian, Italian 

and French, mainly because he's missing deer

old room, lighted only by a single lamp. A curious freak of circumstance that this same room had 

once been the Countess Charlotta's mother's.  "Do you think I might talk to your father? Would it 

do the least good? I suppose he would only think me extraordinarily impertinent?" Sonya queried. 

In the years of her work with the Red Cross since the beginning of the war perhaps she had had a 

singular experience. Instead of finding as most women had, that she had given herself wholly and 

entirely to the needs of the soldiers, it seemed to  "I might have known it," Melroy said in disgust. 

"The ubiquitous lame-brain with a dangerous mechanism.... I suppose he briefed you on what I 

want done, here?"  "Well, not too completely. I gathered that you want me to give intelligence 

tests, or aptitude tests, or something of the sort, to some of your employees. I'm not really one of 

these so-called industrial anthropologists," she explained. "Most of my work, for the past few 

years, has been for public-welfare organizations, with subnormal persons. I told him that, and he
