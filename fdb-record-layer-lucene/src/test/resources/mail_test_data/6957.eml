or--"  No. He settled back. The man on the rock hurried away.  "Oh Jerry!" =
the one in the plane=20

called in perfect English. "Bring an alligator wrench."  Jack heaved a sigh=
 of relief. So they spoke=20

English! They must be okay. At that he stepped boldly out from the brush an=

liability to death from shock therefrom must be remembered.  _Inflammatory =
conditions_ of the=20

_respiratory tract_ or organs are common results; _pneumonia_, _bronchitis_=
, and sudden=20

the plane. The man in the cockpit was bent over working on something. He di=
d not raise his head=20

until Jack was within three yards of the plane. When he did look up, he sta=
rted at the sight of Jack.=20

His figure stiffened. His right hand dropped.  "Stand where you are!" he co=
mmanded. "Who are=20

you? What do you want? And how did you come here?" The man spoke with a dec=
ided accent.=20

"My uniform should tell you what I am," Jack replied evenly.  "In war, unif=
orms mean nothing!" the=20

man snapped. His gray eyes matched the gray of the bushy hair about his tem=
ples. He was no=20

longer young. Between his eyes were two lines that told of work and strain.=
  "I'm sorry." Jack=20

apologized. "I had no intention of startling you. I'm an American fighter p=
ilot, whether you believe it=20

or not. I was shot down nearly two days ago and floated ashore here."  "Tha=
t's okay, son." The=20

man's smile was not unfriendly. His accent, Jack thought, made him English =
or Australian. "We=20

have to be careful, that's all. This plane is a secret weapon."  "It must b=
e," Jack grinned. "I never=20

before saw one that burned kerosene, had no propeller, and yet went like th=
e wind."  "Of course=20

not," the man admitted. "There aren't a dozen of them in the world."  "May =
I look at it?" Jack took a=20

step forward.  "Not a glance. Stay where you are." The man's lips formed a =
straight line. "We're not=20

allowed to show anything. In fact, you're too close right now."  "Oh, that'=
s all right." Jack stepped=20

back. "I'm just naturally curious."  "Oh, sure." The man smiled again. "Wai=
t. I'll climb down and=20

we'll have a cup of coffee. My partner's gone for some tools. The hiding pl=
ace is quite a distance=20

away, just in case."  "I see," said Jack. "Just in case the Japs happen alo=
ng."  "Something like=20

that," the man agreed. He took a step down, then paused. "You might be wond=
ering how we got=20

our supply of kerosene in here right under the Japs' noses," he suggested. =
 "It does seem odd,"=20

Jack agreed.  "It happens to have been here," the stranger went on. To his =
own surprise Jack=20

found himself wondering if the man was telling him the truth or raising a s=
moke screen of=20

falsehood.  "You see, my partner and I once had trading concessions on some=
 of these islands.=20

The Japs forced us off, but before they did that we hid our fuel. Thought w=
e might want to come=20

back, which we did. But we hardly expected to come in a craft like this." H=
e laughed softly.  The=20

man climbed down, poured two cups of hot black coffee from a gallon thermos=
 jug, then invited=20

Jack to a seat on a large flat rock.  "So you like our little ship!" the ma=
n said, warmed by the=20

coffee. "It's really a honey. Nothing in the world was ever like it."  "It =
sure walks on air," Jack=20

agreed.  "So you've seen it fly?" He gave Jack a sharp look.  "Yes." Jack t=
old of seeing it leave the=20

island.  "You'd like to know a lot about it?" The man smiled.  "Naturally."=
  "Some things I can't tell=20

you. All I can tell you has been printed in magazines all over the world. S=
trange you haven't read=20

them."  "We've been at sea for a long time."  "Yes, of course." The man app=
eared to have=20

accepted Jack's story as true. "And the facts about our jet plane haven't b=
een out very=20

_ulcerations_ of the intestines with or without resulting hemorrhage, occur=
s as a frequent lesion=20

(Case 10).  _Gangrene_ or _septic=C3=A6mia_ causes death in other instances=
.  _Exhaustion_, from=20

extensive and prolonged suppuration or from severe and long-continued pain =
and other=20

conditions, terminates other cases (Case 12).  Legally, burns and scalds ar=
e included among=20

injuries endangering life, but are not described as wounds. They may be con=
sidered dangerous=20

according to the extent of surface which they cover, rather than the depth =
to which they involve the=20

tissues.  The extensive injury to the sensory nerve structures and the susp=
ension of function or=20

destruction of a considerable portion of the perspiratory tracts render lar=
ge superficial burns far=20

more fatal than those confined to a small part of a limb, for example, whic=
h may be deeply burned.=20



From a medico-legal point it is desirable to establish the fact of how larg=
e a surface must be=20

injured to prove fatal. The effort to reduce the subject to a statement of =
an exact minimum area of=20

square inches seems very objectionable and liable to lead to erroneous conc=
lusions.  It is possible=20

to make a general statement, subject to some qualifications, which may serv=
e as a basis of=20

conclusion, as each individual case must be considered in its own circumsta=
nces.  A burn=20

involving two-thirds of the body may be regarded as necessarily fatal; but =
the injury of a much less=20

proportion, even one-fourth of the surface, has resulted in death. The qual=
ifications to be made in=20

burns of less extent are pronounced. The _part affected_ is of much importa=
nce. Burns of the=20

trunk are more fatal than those of the extremities; and those of the genita=
l organs[706] and lower=20

part of the abdomen are especially so (Case 7).  The character of the burn,=
 whether single and=20

continuous or multiple and scattered over various portions of the body, is =
a very important=20

modifying circumstance, involving the questions of excessive pain and the d=
ifficulty in insuring=20

necessary treatment for all parts injured.  The physical condition of the p=
atient and sensitiveness=20

of the nervous system to pain exert a powerfully determining influence. Bur=
ns in children and=20

sensitive, nervous females are specially serious and call for an unfavorabl=
e prognosis.=20

=3DSpontaneous Combustion.=3D=E2=80=94Spontaneous combustion of the human b=
ody has been seriously=20

discussed in this connection, and explanations of popularly reported cases =
have been attempted.=20

The writer refers to the subject here for the sole purpose of stating that =
no trustworthy evidence of=20

the possibility of any such condition or result exists.   TREATMENT.  In ca=
ses of severe burns the=20

constitutional as well as the local conditions demand attention. Locally, a=
 great variety of=20

applications has been employed: starch, gum, oxide of zinc, solution of cao=
utchou, collodion,=20

cotton wadding, a mixture of linseed oil and lime-water on cotton or lint, =
and many other agents=20

are used. The important consideration is to exclude the air from and to aff=
ord a protective covering=20

for the injured surface. The constitutional treatment varies in different c=
ases; but its main object is=20

to relieve pain,=20


_
"Jet plane? Is that what you call it?" Jack studied the plane with redouble=
d interest.  "That's what it=20

is. It gets its power from jets of air mixed with exploding gas. The jets c=
ome out from some part of=20

the plane. I'm not permitted to tell exactly what part. You've often watere=
d a lawn, I suppose?"=20

"Yes, quite often."  "Remember how the hose sort of kicked back when the wa=
ter came rushing=20

out?"  "Sure," Jack grinned. "I've been soaked more than once by just that.=
"  "That's the sort of=20

thing that makes our ship go. The jets come out at great speed and just pus=
h the plane along. It=20

practically flies itself."  "How about taking me along on your next flight?=
" Jack held his breath.=20

"Impossible. We reaction from the shock, and support the depressed nervous =
system.  For the first=20

opium or its preparations in proper doses is indicated. Alcoholic stimulant=
s in some cases are=20

demanded in addition. After the stage of reaction has occurred the therapeu=
tics must be governed=20

by inflammatory conditions; or later by the exhaustion from continued pain,=
 suppuration, etc.=20

POST-MORTEM APPEARANCES.  In the EXTERNAL post-mortem examination of a burn=
ed body=20

careful note should be made of the sex, probable age, and every circumstanc=
e leading to the=20

establishment of the identity of the individual. The parts burned should be=
 specially examined as to=20

their condition, whether exhibiting redness, vesication, or=20

so very much depends=20

upon this plane.  "But I'll tell you a little more about it," the man went =
on, sensing Jack's=20

disappointment. "It burns kerosene. You've noticed that, I suppose?"  "Yes.=
"  "It's hard on fuel. We=20

have to carry a belly tank if we want to go far. The Italians made a plane =
somewhat like this one.=20

But it just ate up the fuel. If you've got to land every half hour for fuel=
, your plane's no good. We've=20

overcome that. But this plane still has weak spots."  Jack wondered what th=
e weak spots were, but=20

dared not ask. "Should be fine in the stratosphere," he suggested.  "Say! Y=
ou _do_ know planes,=20

don't you?" the man answered with respect in his tone.  "A little," Jack ad=
mitted.  "Of course it's=20

good in the stratosphere. That's where a propeller-driven plane breaks down=
."  "Nothing for the=20

propeller to get its teeth into," suggested Jack.  "That's right. But our b=
aby here goes fastest when=20

there's the thinnest sort of air in front of her to create friction. Five h=
undred miles an hour? Say!=20

That's nothing!"  Jack stared at the plane with sheer admiration.  Suddenly=
 Jerry, the stranger's=20

partner, came up with an alligator wrench in his hand.  "Got to surface cov=
ered by the burns=20

a line of demarcation.=20

acts is congested. In=20

some instances, however, no redness has been discernible. Where death occur=
red by suffocation=20

and asphyxia, the trachea and bronchial tubes have been found to contain a =
dark smoky or sooty=20

cases found reddened with effusions, more or less considerable, into the ve=
ntricles of the brain=20

and the pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal cavities from the sudden inflo=

glide, touched the sea, cast back a spray, then was in the air and flew swi=

searched for the plane to make whatever discovery he could concerning it, b=
