problem of the greater is solved we shall know that of the lesser; at prese=
nt we can only=20

conjecture. The Scaur Hill circle on Gidleigh Common is a good specimen, be=
ing about ninety-two=20

feet in diameter; near it are several stone-rows or alignments. Dartmoor is=
 famous for these lines=20

of standing-stones, which are generally connected with places of burial; th=
e longest, on Staldon,=20

starting from a circle, runs for over two miles. These, together with the s=
ingle stones or menhirs,=20

were probably intended as memorials of persons or events, and may also have=
 been used as=20

places of gathering; but their religious significance, if any, can have bee=
n little more than a=20

primitive ancestor-worship. At a later period the menhirs were often conver=
ted into crosses, and as=20

such they are common in Devon and Cornwall.  Other tokens of the early inha=
bitants are to be=20

found in the signs of tin-working, but here we have to be careful in assign=
ing dates; much tin-

mining was done in the Middle Ages, and it is not always easy to distinguis=
h between traces that=20

date from many years before Christ and those that belong only to the fourte=
enth or the fifteenth=20

century. The advance in methods of working and in mode of living was very s=
light, and it is quite=20

possible to confuse a rude hut of the medieval tinners with one of prehisto=
ric origin. We cannot=20

positively state what period of the Bronze Age saw the dawn of tin-working =
on Dartmoor, but their=20

place in the oldest folklore gives the "tinkards" a great antiquity. The me=
tal was streamed, or=20

washed from the beds of the moorland rivers, cast in rough ingots, and carr=
ied on pack horses to=20

the Stannary or mintage towns, where it was stamped and taxed. Parts of the=
 old trackways still=20

remain, often paved; and it was for the use of the pack-horses that the cha=
racteristic clapper-

bridges were constructed, like those of Dartmeet, Postbridge, and elsewhere=
. These bridges are=20

quite modern when we compare them with the stone-circles and kistvaens. The=
re was a kind of=20

guild or early trade union between the miners of Devon and Cornwall, remini=
scent of the time=20

when both belonged to "West Wales"; and a relic of the old jurisdiction is =
the Stannary Court still=20

meeting at Truro.  After the Christian era we learn accompanied by a 'swish=
' through the air.  This=20

was all very well; and she was throwing a beautiful, clean line; but she be=
gan to wonder when the=20

bones in her right hand would suddenly succumb and be crunched into a jelly=
.  The weight of the=20

rod--which seemed a mighty engine to her--did not tell on her, for his one =
hand did the whole=20

thing; but his grip was terrible; and yet she did not like to speak.  'Now =
try for yourself,' said he,=20

and he stepped aside.  'Wait a minute,' she said--and she shook her hand, t=
o get the life back into=20

it.  'I did not hurt you?' said he, in great concern.  'We learn in sufferi=
ng what we teach in song,'=20

she said lightly.  'If I am to catch a salmon with a fly-rod, I suppose I h=
ave got to go through=20

something.'  She set to work again; and, curiously enough, she seemed to su=
cceed better with the=20

longer line than with the short one.  There was less jerking; the forward m=
ovement was more=20

even; and though she was far indeed from throwing a good line, it was very =
passable for a=20

beginner.  'You know,' said she, giving him a good-humoured hint, 'I don't =
feel like doing this all=20

day.'  'Well, then, we'll go down to the water now,' said he, and he took t=
he rod from her.  They=20

walked down through the swampy grass and heather to the banks of the stream=
; and here he got=20

out his fly-book--a bulged and baggy volume much the worse for wear.  And t=
hen it instantly=20

occurred to her that this was something she could get for him--the most spl=
endid fly-book and=20

assortment of salmon flies to be procured in London--until it just as sudde=
nly occurred to her that=20

he would have little use for these in Glasgow.  She saw him select a smalli=
sh black and gold and=20

crimson-tipped object from that bulky volume; and a few minutes thereafter =
she was armed for the=20



fray, and he was standing by watching.  Now the Mudal, though an exceedingl=
y 'dour' salmon-

river, is at least easy for a beginner to fish, for there is scarcely anywh=
ere a bush along its level=20

banks.  And there were the pools--some of them deep and drumly enough in al=
l conscience; and=20

no doubt there were salmon in them, if only they could be seduced from thei=
r lair.  For one thing,=20

Ronald had taken her to a part of the stream where she could not, in any ca=
se, do=20


_
the time of the Plantagenets, though we can gather a good deal about its bo=
rder towns. The wild=20

beasts that haunted its desolate recesses brought it some repute as a hunti=
ng-ground, and it was=20

not included in King John's act of disafforestation. We must not be led by =
the term Dartmoor=20

Forest to suppose that the moors were ever covered with woodland--certainly=
 not within historic=20

days; for long centuries they can only have been an almost treeless waste, =
with patches of trees=20

like the surviving stunted oaks of Wistman's Wood. But the borders and some=
 of the river valleys=20

are beautifully wooded.  It must be confessed that the rarest beauty of the=
 moorland belongs to its=20

fringes, around what may be called the gateways of the moor; in the interio=
r there  She began--not=20

without some little excitement, and awful visions of triumph and glory if s=
he should really be able to=20

capture a salmon by her own unaided skill.  Of course she caught in the hea=
ther behind her=20

sometimes; and occasionally the line would come down in a ghastly heap on t=
he water; but then=20

again it would go fairly out and over to the other bank, and the letting it=
 down with the current and=20

drawing it across--as he had shown her in one or two casts--was a comparati=
vely easy matter.=20

She worked hard, at all events, and obeyed implicitly--until alas! there ca=
me a catastrophe.  'A little=20

bit nearer the bank if you can,' said he; 'just a foot nearer.'  She clench=
ed her teeth.  Back went the=20

rod with all her might--and forward again with all=20


_
of heather, ling, and gorse, and occasionally a grand desolation of mist an=
d tempest that may=20

almost strike dismay. A guidebook writer has spoken of Dartmoor as "the qui=
ntessence of unlovely=20

dreariness"; and perhaps there is some justification for his words in the i=
mmediate neighbourhood=20

of Princetown, the solitary town of the moorland mighty crack like that of =
a horse-whip; and calmly=20

he regarded the line as it fell on the water.  'The fly's gone,' said he--b=
ut with not a trace of=20

vexation.  'Oh, Ronald, I'm so sorry!' she cried, for she knew that these t=
hings were expensive,=20

even where they did not involve a considerable outlay of personal skill and=
 trouble.  'Not=20
