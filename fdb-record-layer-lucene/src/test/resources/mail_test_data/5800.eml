variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because 

of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers

Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain 

freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive 

Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and 

future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and 

how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at

Melan Dr. S. Fairbanks, AK, 99712., century.  The life of the time is seen in many memoirs, and in 

the correspondence of many distinguished persons, both men and women. Among the former the 

_Memoires_ of Mdlle. Delaunay, afterwards Mme. de Staal (1684-1750) are remarkable for the 



vein of melancholy, subdued by irony, underlying a style which is formed for fine and clear 

exactness. The Duchesse du Maine's lady-in-waiting, daughter of a poor painter, but educated 

with care, drew delicately in her literary art with an etcher's tool, and her hand was controlled by a 

spirit which had in it something of the Stoic. The _Souvenirs_ of Mme. de Caylus (1673-1729), 

niece of Mme. de Maintenon--"jamais de creature plus seduisante," says Saint-Simon--give 

pictures of the court, charming in their naivete, grace, and mirth. Mme. d'Epinay, designing to tell 

the story of her own life, disguised as a piece of fiction, became in her _Memoires_ the chronicler 

of the manners of her time. The society of the _salons_ and the men of letters is depicted in the 

Memoirs of Marmontel. These are but examples from an abundant literature constantly augmented 

to the days of Mme. de Campan and Mme. Roland. The general aspect of the social world in the 

mid-century is presented by the historian Duclos (1704-1772) in his _Considerations sur les 

Moeurs de ce Siecle_, and with reparation for his previous neglect of the part played in society by 

women in his _Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire du XVIIIe Siecle_.  As much or more may be 

learnt from the letter-writers as from the writers of memoirs. If Voltaire did not take the first place 

by his correspondence, so vast, so luminous, so comprehensive, it might justly be assigned to his 

friend Mme. du Deffand (1697-1780), whose lucid intelligence perceived everything, whose 

disabused heart seemed detached until old age from all that most interested her understanding. 

For clear good sense we turn to the Marquise de Lambert, for bourgeois worth and kindliness to 

Mme. Geoffrin, for passion which kindles the page to Mdlle. de Lespinasse, for sensibility and 

romance ripening to political ardour and strenuous convictions to Mme. Roland. Among the 

philosophers Diderot pours the torrent, clear or turbid, of his genius into his correspondence with 

affluent improvisation; D'Alembert is grave, temperate, lucid; the Abbe Galiani, the little Machiavel-

-"a pantomime from head to foot," said Diderot--the gay Neapolitan punchinello, given the freedom 

of Paris, that "capital of curiosity," is at once wit, cynic, thinker, scholar, and buffoon. These, again, 

are but examples from an epistolary swarm.  While the eighteenth century thus mirrored itself in 

memoirs and letters, it did not forget the life of past centuries. The studious Benedictines, who had 

already accomplished much, continued their erudite labours. Nicolas Freret (1688-1749), taking all 

antiquity for his province, illuminated the study of chronology, geography, sciences, arts, 

language, religion. Daniel and Velly narrated the history of France. Vertot (1655-1735), with little of 

the spirit of historical fidelity, displayed certain gifts of an historical artist. The school of scepticism 

was represented by the Jesuit Hardouin, who doubted the authenticity of all records of the past 

except those of his own numismatic treasures. Questions as to the principles of historical certitude 

occupied the Academy of Inscriptions during many sittings from 1720 onwards, and produced a 

body of important studies. While the Physiocrats were endeavouring to demonstrate that there is a 

natural order in social circumstances, a philosophy of history, which bound the ages together, was 

developed in the writings of Montesquieu and Turgot, if not of Voltaire. The _Esprit des Lois_, the 

_Essai sur les Moeurs_, and

1750 at the Sorbonne, contributed in different degrees and ways towards a new and profounder 

conception of the life of societies or of humanity. By Turgot for the first time the idea of progress 

was accepted as the ruling principle of history. It cannot be denied that, as regards the sciences of 

inorganic nature, he more than foreshadowed Comte's theory of the three states, theological,

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation 

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and 

donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works 

that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of 

equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly 

important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to 

complying with the laws positive, through which the mind of humanity is alleged to have travelled. 

In the second half of the century, history tended to become doctrinaire, aggressive, declamatory--a 

pamphlet in the form of treatise or narrative. Morelly wrote in the interest of socialistic ideas, which 

correspond to those of modern collectivism. Mably, inspired at first by enthusiasm for the ancient 

republics, advanced to a communistic creed. Condorcet, as the century drew towards a close, 

bringing together the ideas of economists and historians, traced human progress through the past, 

and uttered ardent
