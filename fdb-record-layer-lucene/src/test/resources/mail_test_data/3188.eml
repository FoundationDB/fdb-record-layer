ANCING-BEAR  About the first of April, the third year of his adventurous li=
fe, a sense of something that he craved was borne in upon the deep slumber =
of Black Bruin, or perhaps it was only the returning warmth that awakened h=
im.  In either event he awoke, yawned, stretched  But on the morrow, Friday=
, he might venture to go. But, then, would to-morrow ever come? It seemed i=
mpossible. How were the intervening hours to pass? The world, however, was =
not so devoid of resources as himself, and had already appropriated his who=
le day. And, first, Monsignore Catesby came to breakfast with him, talking =
of every thing that was agreeable or interesting, but in reality bent on se=
curing his presence at the _
right in itself, but it led to other things.  One summer morning while the =
farmer was milking, he was=20

startled by hearing apples coming down in showers from the Golden Sweet tre=
e back of the barn.=20

Thinking that some mischievous boy had climbed the tree and was shaking off=
 apples for sport, he=20

rushed into the back yard, determined to punish the offender severely.  "He=
re, you rascal," he=20

shouted as he neared the tree, "what in the world are you trying to do?"  T=
he shaking in the tree=20

ceased immediately, but at first the man could not locate the truant.  Fina=
lly he discovered Black=20

Bruin away up in the top of the tree, where he was well screened by the thi=
ck foliage.  "Come=20

down here," cried the farmer in considerable wrath.  "Come down here and I'=
ll give you a good=20

drubbing."  Black Bruin clearly understood from the man's tone that he was =
angry, so he stayed=20

where he was.  The man then threw apples at him, but they had no more effec=
t upon the culprit=20

than did the grass upon the bad boy in the fable; so the farmer got a long =
pole and prodded the=20

apple thief until he whined and came scratching down the tree.  Black Bruin=
 was very fond of the=20

Golden Sweets, especially when they were baked, and probably thinking that =
there were not=20

enough on the ground for family use, he had taken matters into his own hand=
s.  He seemed very=20

penitent, however, so the family finally forgave him, as they had done so m=
any times before.=20

When the following week he tried the same tactics upon a winter pear-tree, =
the consequences=20

were more serious.  Black Bruin not only got a good drubbing for the prank,=
 but his master=20

secured a dog-collar and chained him to a maple-tree in the yard.  For a wh=
ile he pulled and=20

sulked, but finally, seeing that it was useless, he yielded to the chain.  =
He would beg so hard,=20

though, to be let loose whenever any one went through the yard, that he was=
 always allowed to be=20

unchained and go free, when the family were about and could watch him.  Onc=
e the chain and=20

collar, together with the bear's uneasiness, nearly cost the cub's life.  H=
e would climb up the tree=20

to which he was tied as far as the chain would allow him to go, and, while =
playing various antics on=20

the lower limbs of the tree, he fell.  The chain was on one side of the lim=
b and he was on the other,=20

where he dangled like a culprit on the gallows.  He kicked and choked and t=
ried desperately to=20

catch the limb with his fore-paws, but it was just out of reach and there s=
eemed nothing for him to=20

do but strangle.  The tighter the collar grew and the shorter became his br=
eath the more he kicked=20

and thrashed, until finally the collar broke, and the half-strangled bear f=
ell to the ground with a=20

great thud.  Feeling that he had been cruelly treated and insulted, he pick=
ed himself up with a=20

groan and a growl, and making for the woods, was not seen again for two day=
s.  Finally Black=20

Bruin returned to his friends, having had enough of wild life for that time=
.  He seemed delighted to=20

see them again and wanted to be petted more than ever, and, as if to make a=
mends for his recent=20

bad behavior, was very good for a couple of weeks.  One day the farmer took=
 a super of honey=20

from one of the hives in the back yard, and, as a sort of reward of merit, =
gave Black Bruin a pound=20

for his share.  This was an imprudent act upon the part of the bear's maste=
r, for honey to the bear=20

is what whisky is to the drunkard.  Not that it intoxicated him, but he cra=
ved it with an almost=20

insatiate desire.  This pound was but a taste, so he fell to watching the h=
ives again and perhaps=20

plotting as to how he might get at their contents.  But the hives seemed qu=
ite safe.  They were=20

surrounded by a barbed wire fence six feet high.  They were located under a=
 broad spreading=20

apple-tree, however, and this fact gave Black Bruin his chance.  He waited =
until the farmer had=20

gone to a distant field to work, then climbed into the tree, and out on a l=
ong limb that overhung the=20

hives.  The limb bent lower and lower until it nearly touched the barbed wi=
re fence, but it was just=20



strong enough for him to make the spring and land in the midst of the hives=
.  The good housewife=20

heard the humming and buzzing as the bees swarmed out to punish the intrude=
r, and looking out=20

of the back window, discovered the thief.  Not much damage had been done, a=
s he had been=20

detected almost at the outset; but one thing was now certain; the hives wou=
ld not be safe from=20

Black Bruin any longer.  So the farmer repaired the broken collar and again=
 secured the bear to=20

the maple, and once more he took up the life of a convict.  But it must not=
 be imagined that Black=20

Bruin led a very lonely life even upon the chain, for the children frequent=
ly took him berrying, or to=20

the deep woods for nuts.  When the apples had been picked and most of the h=
oney taken from the=20

hives, to be done by prayer-books, but by something else, and something els=
e wanted a=20

subscription.  This was the object of the meeting and the burden of all the=
 speeches which=20

followed, and which were progressively more outspoken than the adroit intro=
ductory discourse.=20

The Saxon was denounced, sometimes with coarseness, but sometimes in terms =
of picturesque=20

passion; the vast and extending organization of the brotherhood was enlarge=
d on, the great results=20

at hand intimated; the necessity of immediate exertion on the part of every=
 individual pressed with=20

emphasis. All these views and remarks received from the audience an encoura=
ging response; and=20

when Lothair observed men going round with boxes, and heard the clink of co=
in, he felt very=20

embarrassed as to what he should do when asked to contribute to a fund rais=
ed to stimulate and=20

support rebellion against his sovereign. He regretted the rash restlessness=
 which had involved him=20

in such a position.  The collectors approached Lothair, who was standing at=
 the end of the room=20

opposite to the platform, where the space was not crowded.  =E2=80=9CI shou=
ld like to speak to Father=20

O=E2=80=99Molloy,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Che is a priest, and will =
understand my views.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe is a priest here,=E2=80=9D said=
=20

one of the collectors with a sardonic laugh, =E2=80=9Cbut I am glad to say =
you will not find his name in the=20

directory. Father O=E2=80=99Molloy is on the platform and engaged.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CIf you want to speak to the father,=20

speak from where you are,=E2=80=9D said the other collector. =E2=80=9CHere,=
 silence! a gentleman wants to address=20

the meeting.=E2=80=9D  And there was silence, and Lothair felt extremely em=
barrassed, but he was not=20

wanting, though it was the first time in his life that he had addressed a p=
ublic meeting.=20

=E2=80=9CGentlemen,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9CI really had no wish to=
 intrude upon you; all I desired was to speak to=20

Father O=E2=80=99Molloy. I wished to tell him that it would have given me p=
leasure to subscribe to these=20

schools. I am not a Roman Catholic, but I respect the Roman Catholic religi=
on. But I can do=20

nothing that will imply the slightest sanction of the opinions I have heard=
 expressed this evening.=20

For your own sakes=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D but here a yell arose which forever dr=
owned his voice.  =E2=80=9CA spy, a spy!=E2=80=9D was=20

the general exclamation. =E2=80=9CWe are betrayed! Seize him! Knock him ove=
r!=E2=80=9D and the whole meeting=20

seemed to have turned their backs on the platform and to be advancing on th=
e unfortunate Lothair.=20

Two of the leaders on the platform at the same time leaped down from it, to=
 direct as it were the=20

enraged populace.  But at this moment a man who had been in the lower part =
of the hall, in the=20

vicinity of Lothair and standing alone, pushed forward, and by his gestures=
 and general mien=20

arrested somewhat the crowd, so that the two leaders who leaped from the pl=
atform and bustled=20

through the crowd came in contact with him.  The stranger was evidently not=
 of the class or=20

country of the rest assembled. He had a military appearance, and spoke with=
 a foreign accent=20

when he said, =E2=80=9CThis is no spy. Keep your people off.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CAnd who are you?=E2=80=9D inquired the leader thus=20

addressed.  =E2=80=9COne accustomed to be obeyed,=E2=80=9D said the strange=
r.  =E2=80=9CYou may be a spy yourself,=E2=80=9D said=20

the leader.  =E2=80=9CI will not undertake to say that there are no spies i=
n this room,=E2=80=9D said the stranger, =E2=80=9Cbut=20



this person is not one, and anybody who touches this person will touch this=
 person at his peril.=20

Stand off, men!=E2=80=9D And they stood off. The wave retreated backward, l=
eaving the two leaders in front.=20

A couple of hundred men, a moment before apparently full of furious passion=
 and ready to take=20

refuge in the violence of fear, were cowed by a single human being.  =E2=80=
=9CWhy, you are not afraid of=20

one man?=E2=80=9D said the leaders, ashamed of their following. =E2=80=9CWh=
atever betides, no one unknown shall=20

leave this room, or it will be Bow Street to-morrow morning.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CNevertheless,=E2=80=9D said the stranger,=20

=E2=80=9Ctwo unknown men will leave this room and with general assent. If a=
ny one touches this person or=20

myself I will shoot him dead,=E2=80=9D and he drew out his revolver, =E2=80=
=9Cand as for the rest, look at that,=E2=80=9D he=20

added, giving a paper to the leader of the Fenian Lodge, =E2=80=9Cand then =
give it me back again.=E2=80=9D  The=20

leader of the Fenian Lodge glanced at the paper; he grew pale, then scarlet=
, folded the paper with=20

great care and returned it reverentially to the stranger, then looking roun=
d to the assembly and=20

waving his hand he said, =E2=80=9CAll right, the gentlemen are to go.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, you have got out of a scrape,=20

young air,=E2=80=9D said the stranger to Lothair when they had escaped from=
 the hall.  =E2=80=9CAnd how can I=20

express my gratitude to you?=E2=80=9D Lothair replied.  =E2=80=9CPoh!=E2=80=
=9D said the stranger, =E2=80=9Ca mere affair of common=20

duty. But what surprises me is how you got your pass-ticket.=E2=80=9D  Loth=
air told him all.  =E2=80=9CThey manage=20

their affairs in general wonderfully close,=E2=80=9D said the stranger, =E2=
=80=9Cbut I have no opinion of them. I have=20

just returned=20


_
wished.  But the very worst of all Black Bruin's mischief and thieving came=
 about the second week=20

in November, when he had been upon his good behavior for several weeks, and=
 the family hoped=20

that he had reformed.  One night the household was awakened by the most vio=
lent and persistent=20

squealing of a pig.  It did not seem to be any of the pigs at the farm, but=
 the sound came from=20

down the road and it steadily drew nearer to the buildings.  What it all me=
ant the farmer could not=20

imagine, so he hurriedly dressed and went out-of-doors to find out.  He was=
 just in time to see=20

Black Bruin come shambling into the yard carrying a pig, of perhaps twelve =
pounds' weight, in his=20

mouth.  He was holding him by one hind leg and the load was so heavy that t=
he culprit could=20

barely keep the poor pig's nose from dragging on the ground.  The farmer at=
 once went to his=20

assistance and rescued him, to the great disgust of Black Bruin, who growle=
d and plainly gave his=20

master to understand that he Ireland, where I thought I would go and see wh=
at they really are=20

after. No real business in them. Their treason is a fairy tale, and their s=
edition a child talking in its=20

sleep.=E2=80=9D  They walked together about half a mile, and then the stran=
ger said, =E2=80=9CAt the end of this we=20

shall get into the City Road, and the land again of omnibus and public conv=
eyances, and I shall=20

wish you good night.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut it is distressing to me to part=
 thus,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CPray let me call and=20

pay my respects to my benefactor.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo claim to any such t=
itle,=E2=80=9D said the stranger; =E2=80=9CI am always=20

glad to be of use. I will not trouble you to call on me, for, frankly, I ha=
ve no wish to increase the=20

circle of my acquaintance. So, good-night; and, as you seem to be fond of a=
 little life, take my=20

advice, and never go about unarmed.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 28 The Fenian ad=
venture furnished the=20

distraction which Lothair required It broke that absorbing spell of sentime=
nt which is the delicious=20

but enervating privilege of the=20


_
him out of the home sty, so that his master had no right to interfere.  Aga=
in Black Bruin paid the=20

penalty for misbehavior and was chained up, while next morning, the farmer =
had the humiliation of=20

carrying the pig home.  After about a week more of life upon the chain, the=
 culprit slipped his collar=20

and disappeared.  This time the farmer Lothair woke in the morning from his=
 well-earned=20

slumbers, the charm returned, and he fell at once into a reverie of Belmont=
, and a speculation=20

when he might really pay his first visit there. Not to-day=E2=80=94that was=
 clearly out of the question. They=20

had separated only yesterday, and yet it seemed an age, and the adventure o=
f another world.=20
