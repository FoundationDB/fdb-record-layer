Having been lost in the shuffle, as he expressed it, Blount made the most of these reflective 

excursions during the period of the box-party captivity. From the rising of the curtain to the going 

down thereof the Weatherfords, mother and daughter, kept him from exchanging so much as a 

word with Patricia, whom Gantry was shamelessly monopolizing. But on the short return walk to 

the hotel, Blount asserted his rights and gave Patricia his arm.  "I think you owe me an abject 

apology," was the way she began on him, when they had gained such privacy as the crowded 

sidewalk conferred.  "Consider it made, and then tell me what for," he rejoined, striving, man-

fashion, to catch step with her mood.  "For making us leave that dear, delightful, out-of-date, and 

out-of-place Georgian mansion in the hills and come to town when we want to get a sight of your 

face."  "If anybody else should say a thing like as we make of this kind must be regulated or 

controlled by conditions over which we have no influence.  "Times and seasons form an important 

consideration. We are going to India, and the season is advancing. The southern end of the Red 

Sea is in latitude 12 deg. north, where you are likely to see some hot weather; and the longer we 

delay, the hotter it will be. We shall sail from here Tuesday morning; and if we do not make a run 

up into the Persian Gulf, we shall probably be at Bombay by the first of next month. That city is in 

latitude 19 deg., or about that of the south side of Cuba, of which you know something. We shall 

see plenty of extremely hot weather, but we wish to avoid it as much as possible.  "There are 

several routes to Mount Sinai, three from Suez, and two from ports south of it. It will take from two 

weeks by the shortest route to four by the others. It is a very fatiguing journey

compliment," he retorted. Her near presence seemed to lift the burden he was carrying, and it was 

good to be light-hearted again, if only for the passing moment.  "It wasn't meant for a compliment," 

she returned, with the straightforward sincerity which Blount had always been fond of likening to a 

cup of cold water on a thirsty day. "Consider a moment. You come to me with a really harrowing 

story of your new experiences, and just as I am beginning to get interested we are interrupted. In 

the morning, at some perfectly impossible hour, off you go, and we hear no more of you for weeks 

and weeks. What have you been doing?"  "I have been doing precisely what you told me to do; 

diligence, and it would require a full month for us to see the country properly. My first objection is 

the time it would require.  "In the next place, the expense is from forty to fifty francs a day, eight to 

ten dollars, for each person, over a hundred dollars a day. If the result justified it, I should not 

object to the expense, and I don't think Uncle Moses would. There are no hotels in this region, and 

you would have to camp out, live in hovels, or at best in the monastery; and the trip would involve 

a great deal of discomfort to persons not accustomed to roughing it. The 'Big Four' might make a 

pleasant affair of it, but most of the others would not.  "All the preparations for

gospel of honesty and fair dealing, and trying my level best to make other people practise it."  "You 

have been successful?" she asked quickly.  "Reasonably so in the preaching, since that depended 

solely upon me. As to the other, I don't know. Sometimes I'm credulous enough to believe that the 

house-cleaners are honestly at work, as they say they are, and at other times I'm afraid they are 

only putting up a bluff to mislead me. Some day, perhaps, I may tell you how far I have had to go 

into the 'practical-politics' armory to get my weapons."  There was still a half-square of the 

sidewalk privacy available, and she made what seemed to be the most necessary use of it.  "And 

your father, Evan; are you coming to understand him any better?"  He shook his head 

despondently. "No; or rather yes. I might say that I am coming to understand him--or his methods--

only too well. The only way we can keep from quarrelling now is to banish politics when we are 

together."  "I am sorry," she said, and the sorrow was emphatic in her tone. "As I have said before, 

you don't understand him. You are judging him by standards which, however just and true they 

may be, are peculiarly your own standards. I know you can be broad for others when you try. Can't 

you be broad for him?"  It was good to hear her defend his father. It was what he would have 

wished his wife to do. Suddenly there arose within him a huge reluctance to lessen or to weaken in 

any way her trust in David Blount.  "Let us say that the fault is mine," he interposed hastily. "God 

forbid that I should be the means of making you think less of him in any respect."  "You couldn't do 

that, Evan. He is simply a grand old man--the first I have ever known for whom the hackneyed 

phrase seemed to have been made," she asserted warmly. "If he has faults, I am sure they are 

nothing more than gigantic virtues--the faults of a man who is too strong and too magnanimous to 

be little in any respect."  The final half-square lay behind them, and Mrs. Honoria and the senator, 

Gantry, Gordon and his wife, and the two Weatherfords, with one of the marriageable daughters, 

were at the _cafe_ door waiting for the laggards. Being in no proper frame of mind to enjoy a 

theatre supper with another Weatherford attack as the dragomans who contract to supply tents, 

camels, food, and everything required are to be found, and I was approached by three of them at 

Shepheard's Hotel."  "Then the trip seems to be impossible now, and it is useless to talk about it," 

suggested Mr. Woolridge; and the captain thought he could perceive an expression of relief on his 

face.  "It is not impossible," added the commander with a smile. "We can go to Tur, 140 miles 

south of Suez, and there we shall find camels and a contractor, though perhaps not for so large a 

company. I do not think our party would enjoy the trip whichever way we might go. It is a rough 

country, a group of mountains. The Monastery is 5,014 feet high, and it must be cold weather up 

there in January. The Jebel Musa, which is usually regarded as the Holy Mountain, is 7,363 feet 

high; but even Mount Sinai itself is disputed ground, and the question 'Is Mount Serbal the Sinai of 

Scripture?' is discussed by the critics. Serbal is 8,712 feet high, the loftiest, I believe, on the 

peninsula, and is nearer to the gulf than the others.  "I believe the discomfort and exposure of the 

trip render it impracticable at the present time and at the present season. The guide-books 

indicate the months of March and April as the best for the excursion; and it is too early to go now 

with comfort, not to say enjoyment. Of course I do not know what Mr. Belgrave, under the advice 

of his guardian and trustee, will do with the Guardian-Mother when our present voyage shall be 

completed; but if he should retain the steamer, I should recommend him to make a trip across the 

ocean at the right time, and up the Mediterranean, by the Gulf of Iskanderun to Alexandretta, 

which is near the head waters of the Euphrates River, a proposed route to India by the Persian 



Gulf, of which I may have something to say another day.  "From this city the steamer could take in 

the ports of the Holy Land, or her passengers could journey through Syria by land, with tents and 

dragoman. The ship could then be left at Port Said, the party could come through the canal to 

Suez in the Maud, or by some other conveyance, and then make a business of exploring the 

Peninsula of Sinai," said the commander in conclusion.  "That arrangement would suit me much 

better,"

reluctantly surrendered Patricia to Gantry, made his excuses, and went to smoke a bedtime pipe 

in the homelike and democratic lobby.  With Patricia in town the "silver-tongued spellbinder of 

Quaretaro Mesa," as _The Daily Capital_ called the railroad company's campaign field-officer, 

would have been glad to evade some of the speaking appointments; but since his engagements 

had been made some days in advance, he was obliged to go.  On his return to the capital he was 

have been groaning at the necessity of going home without seeing the Holy Land. I shall keep this 

plan in my mind as one to be carried out in a couple of years if my son does not object to it."  "The 

Guardian-Mother shall not go out of commission until this voyage is completed," replied Louis 

promptly. "Captain Ringgold is engaged as commander for life, and he will attend to the 

accomplishment of my mother's wishes."  "I thank you, Mr. Belgrave, for the confidence
