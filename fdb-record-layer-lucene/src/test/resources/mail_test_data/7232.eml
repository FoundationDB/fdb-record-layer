men set to work, and dug long and desperately to uncover the treasure, and =
after three days of=20

incessant toil they were rewarded with success. A rich vein of gold, or, ra=
ther, a deposit of the=20

valuable metal was found, it being formed in a deep, natural pocket and mix=
ed alternately with=20

sand and rock.  During the remaining four days of that week the two lucky m=
iners took out enough=20

gold to evidence their supposition that they had struck one of the richest =
fields in all the Black Hills=20

country. Indeed, it seemed that there was no end to began its abuse and dis=
integration; the result=20

we see in the meaningless presentations which pass for "woman's pages" in t=

assurance that, being a=20

of their early triumph, the=20

old humpback was visited by another somnambulistic fit, and this time he di=
scovered gold down in=20

the northern mountain side, and prophesied that the quartz rock which could=
 be mined therefrom=20

would more than repay the cost and trouble of opening up the vein and of tr=
ansporting machinery=20

to the gulch.  We need not go into detail of what followed; suffice it to s=
ay that immediate=20

arrangements were made and executed toward developing this as yet unknown t=

thing that he "must carry=20

to catch the women"; and forthwith he either forgets it or refuses to give =
the editor of his woman's=20

page even a reasonable allowance to spend on her material.  The result is, =
of course, inevitable:=20

pages of worthless material.  There is, in fact, no part of the Sunday news=

association, that if the American women were not reading the newspapers, th=
e American public,=20

as a whole, was not reading the number of books that it should, considering=
 the intelligence and=20

wealth of the people, and the cheap prices at which books were sold.=20

unknown to the roving population of the Hills country. And most wonderful t=
o relate, he succeeded.=20

Two weeks after his departure, he returned with the machinery and two score=
 of Ute Indians,=20
