Parr swung roundabout to score on the jaw again. Ling actually gave back, d=
ropping his immense=20

bludgeon. A body less firmly pedestalled upon powerful legs and scoop-shove=
l feet would have=20

gone down. It took a moment for him to recover.  "Aaaah!" he roared. "I kil=
l you!"  Parr had=20

stooped and caught up his own discarded club. Now he threw it full at the d=
istorted face of his=20

enemy. Ling's hands flashed up like a shortstop's, snatched the stick in mi=
dair, and broke it in two=20

like a carrot. Another roar, and Ling charged, head down and arms outflung =
for a pulverizing=20

grapple.  Parr sprang sidewise. Ling blundered past. His stooping head cras=
hed against a tree, his=20

whole body bounded back from the impact, and down he went in a quivering, m=
oaning heap. He=20

did not get up.  Parr backed away, gazing at the others. They stood silent =
in a score of attitudes,=20

like children playing at moving statues. Then:  "Huh!" cried one. "New boss=
!"  A chorus of cries=20

and howls greeted this. They gathered around Parr with fawning faces. "You =
boss! You fight Ling--

beat 'im. Huh, you boss!"  At the racket, Ling recovered a little, and mana=
ged to squirm into a=20

sitting posture. "Yes," he said, "you boss."  With one hand holding his hal=
f-smashed skull, he lifted=20

the other in salute to Parr.         *       *       *       *       *  It =
took time--several days--but Parr got over=20

his first revulsion at the bestial traits of his new companions. After all,=
 in shedding the wit and=20

grace of man, they were recovering the honest simplicity of animals. For in=
stance, Ling was not=20

malicious about being displaced, as Shanklin had been. Too, there was much =
more real mutual=20

helpfulness, if not so much talk about it. When one of the horde found a ne=
w crop of berries or=20

roots or nuts, he set up a yell for his friends to come and share. A couple=
 of oldsters, doddering=20

and fair at hand? Go down to the town, Patrick, and see what is going on.  =
PATRICK [_opens the=20

door to go out, but stops for a moment on the threshold_]. Will Delia remem=
ber, do you think, to=20

bring the greyhound pup she promised me when she would be coming to the hou=
se?  MICHAEL.=20

She will surely.            [PATRICK _goes out, leaving the door open._]  P=
ETER. It will be Patrick's=20

turn next to be looking for a fortune, but he won't find it so easy to get =
it and he with no place of his=20

own.  BRIDGET. I do be thinking sometimes, now things are going so well wit=
h us, and the Cahels=20

such a good back to us in the district, and Delia's own uncle a priest, we =
might be put in the way of=20

making Patrick a priest some day, and he so good at his books.  PETER. Time=
 enough, time=20

enough; you have always your head full of plans, Bridget.  BRIDGET. We will=
 be well able to give=20

him learning, and not to send him trampling the country like a poor scholar=
 that lives on charity.=20

[_Cheers._]  MICHAEL. They're not done cheering yet.            [_He goes o=
ver to the door and=20

stands there for a moment,           putting up his hand to shade his eyes.=
_]  BRIDGET. Do you see=20

anything?  MICHAEL. I see an old woman coming up the path.  BRIDGET. Who is=
 it, I wonder. It=20

must be the strange woman Patrick saw awhile ago.  MICHAEL. I don't think i=
t's one of the=20

neighbours anyway, but she has her cloak over her face.  BRIDGET. It might =
be some poor=20

woman heard we were making ready for the wedding and came to look for her s=
hare.  PETER. I=20

may as well put the money out of sight. There is no use leaving it out for =
every stranger to look at.=20

[_He goes over to a large box in the corner, opens it, and           puts t=
he bag in and fumbles at the=20

lock._]  MICHAEL. There she is, father! [_An_ Old Woman _passes the window =
slowly; she looks=20

at_ MICHAEL _as=20


_
cared for by the younger beast-men. And all stood ready to obey Parr's slig=
htest word or gesture.=20

Thus, though it was a new thought to them, several went exploring with him =
to the north pole of=20

their world. The journey was no more than fifteen miles, but took them acro=
ss grassy, foodless=20

plains which had never been worth negotiation. Parr chose Ling and another =
comparatively=20

intelligent specimen who called himself Ruba. Izak, the mild-mannered one w=
ho had first met and=20

guided Parr on the night of his banishment from the human village, also ple=
aded to go. Several=20

others would have joined the party, but the deterioration of legs and feet =
made them poor walkers.=20

The four went single file--Parr, then big Ling, then Ruba, then Izak. not t=
o come to the house the=20

night before my wedding.  BRIDGET. Open the door, Michael; don't keep the p=
oor woman waiting.=20

[_The_ OLD WOMAN _comes in._ MICHAEL _stands aside to make           way fo=
r her._]  OLD=20

WOMAN. God save all here!  PETER. God save you kindly!  OLD WOMAN. You have=
 good=20

shelter here.  PETER. You are welcome to whatever shelter we have.  BRIDGET=
. Sit down there=20

by the fire and welcome.  OLD WOMAN [_warming her hands_]. There is a hard =
wind outside.=20

[MICHAEL _watches her curiously from the door_. PETER _comes           over=
 to the table._]=20

PETER. Have you travelled far to-day?  OLD WOMAN. I have travelled far, ver=
y far; there are few=20

have travelled so far as myself, and there's many a one=20

for quenching thirst. They also carried clubs.  The plain was well-grassed,=
 as high as Ling's=20

knuckled knee. Occasionally small creatures hopped or scuttled away. The be=
ast-men threw=20

stones until Parr told them to stop--he could not help but wonder if those =
scurriers had once been=20

men. The hot sun made him sweat under his plate-armor, but not for all the =
Solar System would=20

he have laid it aside.  They paused for noonday lunch in a grove of ferny t=
rees beyond the plain,=20

then scaled some rough lava-like rocks. In the early afternoon they came to=
 what must be the=20

asteroid's northern pole.  Like There was one that had strong sons I though=
t were friends of mine,=20

but they were shearing their sheep, and they wouldn't listen to me.  PETER.=
 It's a pity indeed for=20

any person to have no place of their own.  OLD WOMAN. That's true for you i=
ndeed, and it's long=20

I'm on the roads since I first went wandering.  BRIDGET. It is a wonder you=
 are not worn out with=20

so much wandering.  OLD WOMAN. Sometimes my feet are tired and my hands are=
 quiet, but=20

there is no quiet in my heart. When the people see me quiet, they think old=
 age has come on me=20

and that all the stir has gone out of me. But when the=20
