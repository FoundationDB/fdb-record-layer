mountain air of Bethlehem blows through them, and the dew of life's quiet morning is on them. The 

early experience supplied their materials, whatever was the date of their composition; and in them 

we can see what his inward life was in these budding years. The gaze of child-like wonder and 

awe upon the blazing brightness of the noonday, and on the mighty heaven with all its stars, the 

deep voice with which all creation spoke of God, the great thoughts of the dignity of man (thoughts 

ever welcome to lofty youthful souls), the gleaming of an inward light brighter than all suns, the 

consciousness of mysteries of weakness which may become miracles of sin in one's own heart, 

the assurance of close relation to God as His anointed and His servant, the cry for help and 

guidance--all this is what we should expect David to have thought and felt as he wandered among 

the hills, alone with God; and this is what these psalms give us.  Common to them all is the 

peculiar manner of looking upon nature, so uniform in David's psalms, so unlike more modern 

descriptive poetry. He can smite out a picture in a phrase, but he does not care to paint 

landscapes. He feels the deep analogies between man and his dwelling-place, but he does not 

care to lend to nature a shadowy life, the reflection of our own. Creation is to him neither a subject 

for poetical description, nor for scientific examination. It is nothing but the garment of God, the 

apocalypse of the heavenly. And common to them all is also the swift transition from the outward 

facts which reveal God, to the spiritual world, where His presence is, if it were possible, yet more 

needful, and His operations yet mightier. And common to them all is a certain rush of full thought 

and joyous power, which is again a characteristic of youthful work, and is unlike the elegiac 

tenderness and pathos of David's later hymns.  The nineteenth Psalm paints for us the glory of the 

inst. Train glace--poult de soie bouillionee, &c.  I am not sure that to attend the professional social 

gatherings of a Parisian "undressmaker" and pay him twenty francs a "look" is not less 

objectionable, but this is the British way of worshipping the same idol. This vein of reflection was 

suggested to me by Bodwinkle's ball. Talk of sermons in stones! they are nothing to the sermons 

contained in drums and balls.  First, I have already let my readers into the secret history of that 

ball. I have told them how Lady Broadhem and Spiffy Goldtip combined their resources and 

launched the Bodwinkles in Vanity Fair with a gorgeous mansion and Lady Mundane's invitation 

list. To describe all Spiffy's exertions in the Bodwinkle cause for some days prior to the ball would 

be impossible. To tell of the extraordinary suggestions that Bodwinkle was continually making with 

reference to the decoration of the banisters, the arrangements for supper, and the utter ignorance 

he displayed throughout of the nature of the enterprise upon which he had embarked, would 

occupy more space than I can afford. To give a list of the guests would be superfluous, as they 

were very accurately reported in the columns of the 'Morning Post.' In spite of all Spiffy could do, 

Bodwinkle would insist upon inviting a number of his own friends, and nearly ruined the party 

irretrievably by allowing one man to bring his daughters. However, as Mrs B. did not take the 

slightest notice of them, and as they knew nobody, they went away early. Nevertheless, as Lady 

Veriphast said, "There were all kinds of people that one had never seen in one's life before." This 

was the great mistake. People don't yet humiliate themselves to get invitations to meet people 

they never saw before. They may come to that, but at present nothing is worth going to unless all 

society wants to go: then anything is. Now Spiffy had so managed, that by a judicious system

the eighth by night. The former gathers up the impressions of many a fresh morning when the 

solitary shepherd-boy watched the sun rising over the mountains of Moab, which close the eastern 

view from the hills above Bethlehem. The sacred silence of dawn, the deeper hush of night, have 

voice for his ear. "No speech! and no words! unheard is their voice." But yet, "in all the earth goeth 

forth their line,[B] and in the end of the habitable world their sayings." The heavens and the 

firmament, the linked chorus of day and night, are heralds of God's glory, with silent speech, heard 

in all lands, an unremitting voice. And as he looks, there leaps into the eastern heavens, not with 

the long twilight of northern lands, the sudden splendour, the sun radiant as a bridegroom from the 

bridal chamber, like some athlete impatient for the course. How the joy of morning and its new 

vigour throb in the words! And then he watches the strong runner climbing the heavens till the 

fierce heat beats down into the deep cleft of the Jordan, and all the treeless southern hills, as they 

slope towards the desert, lie bare and blazing beneath the beams.  [B] Their boundary, _i.e._, their 

territory, or the region through which their witness extends. Others render "their chord," or sound 

(LXX. Ewald, etc.)  The sudden transition from the revelation of God in nature to His voice in the 

law, has seemed to many critics unaccountable, except on the supposition that this psalm is made 

up of two fragments, put together by a later compiler; and some of them have even gone so far as 

to maintain that "the feeling which saw God revealed in the law did not arise till the time of 

Josiah."[C] But such a hypothesis is not interest in the Bodwinkle ball--he had been morally bill-

sticking it in all the clubs for weeks past. He had told the most _repandu_ young dancing men that 

it would be impossible for him to get them invitations. If Bodwinkle had been General Tom Thumb, 

and Spiffy had been Barnum, he could not have achieved a greater success. He had insisted upon 

Bodwinkle having Mrs B. painted by the most fashionable artist and exhibited in the Academy, 

where the hanging committee, some of whom were at the ball afterwards, gave it a good place, 

and the 'Times' critic gave it half a column. Until then he had kept her dark. No one had ever seen 

Mrs Bodwinkle, except three or four literary men, who discreetly and mysteriously alluded to her 

intellect, and a naughty duke, who indiscreetly and less mysteriously alluded to her charms. 

People began to want to make Mrs Bodwinkle's acquaintance some time before the ball, but she 

resolutely denied herself. The only men who were let into the secret were Bower, Scraper, and a 

few others skilled in the art of socially advertising. Their principal function consisted in asking 

every one of their friends for some time before whether they were going to the Bodwinkle ball. It 

oozed out, through Spiffy, that I knew something of Bodwinkle, and the result was that I was 

bombarded with requests to procure invitations. This was the style of note that arrived incessantly. 

This is from Mary, Marchioness of Pimlico:--       "DEAR LORD FRANK,--Lady Mundane tells me 

that you are one of      the privileged few who can get invitations to the Bodwinkles'.      Please 

exert your interest in my favour. You know this is      Alice's first season.--Yours truly,       "MARY 

PIMLICO."

either the sudden transition or the difference in style and rhythm between the two parts of the 

psalm, which unquestionably exists. The turn from the outer world to the better light of God's word, 

is most natural; the abruptness of it is artistic and impressive; the difference of style and measure 

gives emphasis to the contrast. There is also an obvious connection between the two parts, 

inasmuch as the law is described by epithets, which in part hint at its being a brighter sun, 

enlightening the eyes.  [C] "Psalms chronologically arranged"--following Ewald.  The Word which 

declares the will of the Lord is better than the heavens which tell His glory. The abundance of 

synonyms for that word show how familiar to his thoughts it was. To him it is "the law," "the 

testimonies" by which God witnesses of Himself and of man: "the statutes," the fixed settled 

ordinances; that which teaches "the fear of God," the "judgments" or utterances of His mind on 

human conduct. They are "perfect, firm, right, clean, pure,"--like that spotless sun--"eternal, true." 

"They quicken, make wise, enlighten," even as the light of the lower world. His heart prizes them 

"more than gold," of which in his simple life he knew so little; more than "the honey," which he had 

often seen dropping from "the comb" in the pastures of the Here is another one:--       "DEAR 

LORD FRANK,--Do _please_ get an invitation for _my very      great friend_, Amy Rumsort, for the 

Bodwinkles'. She is most      anxious to go, _for very particular_ reasons. I will tell you      them 

when we meet. Spiffy Goldtip sent mamma mine, but declines      to come to the front about Amy.-

-Yours most sincerely, HARRIET      WYLDE."  "Wild Harrie" is the name by which this young lady 

is usually known among her sporting friends. She is a promising _debutante_, and very properly 

calls herself "first favourite" of the season.  "Dear me," thought I, as I opened a series of similar 

epistles, "if I were the head of a public department, who only recommended honours to be given to 

those who applied for them oftenest, and if all these were meritorious public servants wanting 

C.B.'s, or gallant soldiers anxious for Victoria Crosses, they could not beg more pertinaciously and 

unblushingly." And I made a list of the petitioners, leaving out those who had written to me without 

knowing me, and went to the club, where I intrusted them to Spiffy, with a peremptory request that 

he would distribute the required invitations upon pain of my financial displeasure.  Spiffy gave me 

some curious statistics about invitations and the means employed to obtain them. Three ladies 

who never asked

And then the twofold contemplation rises into the loftier region of prayer. He feels that there are 

dark depths in his soul, gloomier pits than any into which the noontide sun shines. He speaks as 

one who is conscious of dormant evils, which life has not yet evolved, and his prayer is more 

directed towards the future than the past, and is thus very unlike the tone of the later psalms, that 

wail out penitence and plead for pardon. "Errors," or weaknesses,--"faults" unknown to himself,--

"high-handed sins,"[D]--such is the climax of the evils from which he prays for deliverance. He 

knows himself "Thy servant" (2 Sam. vii. 5, 8; Psa. lxxviii. parties, and whom he had therefore left 

out, though all more or less leaders of the _beau monde_, actually wrote to Mrs Bodwinkle in 

various strains--one was a threatening, the other an appealing letter, and the third assumed that 

she had been omitted by mistake. Two young gentlemen had the impertinence, after trying every 

other mode in vain, actually to call on Mrs Bodwinkle, and extract invitations from that bewildered 

woman, who was too much frightened to refuse them. Bodwinkle was not idle in the House, and 

two Liberals and an extreme Radical, all young, unable to resist temptation, voted against the 

Government on the promise of invitations.

consecration to God's work by Samuel's anointing. He needs not only a God who sets His glory in 

the heavens, nor even one whose will is made known, but one who will touch his spirit,--not merely 

a Maker, but a pardoning God; and his faith reaches its highest point as his song closes with the 

sacred name of the covenant Jehovah, repeated for the seventh time, and invoked in one final 

experience, and tells me he can scarcely resist entering upon a pecuniary _exploitation_ of his 

position in society. "There is," said that enterprising and original individual, "so much to be done by 

a man of genius. Just look what is open to me in this line,----  "'Families in the country anxious that 

their sons should be well _lances_ in the society of the metropolis, are requested to apply
