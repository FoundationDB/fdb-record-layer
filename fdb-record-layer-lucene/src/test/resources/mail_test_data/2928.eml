 fun.  The excitement _
in the verbal skirmishes his choleric temper prompted him to provoke.  The =
account given by Las=20

Casas of the debate before the King gives us a good picture of the stately =
ceremonial observed at=20

the Court of Charles V. The King being seated on his throne, the others pre=
sent were=20

accommodated on benches extending along both sides of the audience chamber;=
 to the right of=20

the King sat M. de Chievres, next to whom was the Admiral Don Diego Columbu=
s; then the Bishop=20

of Darien and finally the licentiate, Aguirre.  On the left hand of the thr=
one was seated the Grand=20

Chancellor, next to at a pot of great curly white Chrysanthemums, and as Ca=
ro made no noise in=20

crossing the grass he was not conscious of her approach until a deep drawn =
sigh at his elbow=20

caused him to turn with a start.  It would have been impossible to carry Tr=
olley another step; too=20

much out of breath to speak, and with cheeks which matched her jacket, she =
rested his weight on=20

the broad arm of the chair while she unhooked his front paws from her shoul=
der. Walter watched=20

her with very evident surprise.  =E2=80=9CHe sticks dreadfully,=E2=80=9D sh=
e said, struggling with the burr-like paws.=20

=E2=80=9CI should say so;=E2=80=9D the=20


_
order of precedence.  Las Casas and the Franciscan stood at the foot of the=
 room, opposite the=20

throne.  After a moment of silence following the seating of the Court, M. d=
e Chievres and the=20

Grand Chancellor rose, advanced together, and mounting the steps of the thr=
one knelt before the=20

King, to whom they spoke in whispers as though receiving some secret instru=
ctions.  Returning=20

then to their respective places and being again seated, the Chancellor said=
, "Reverend Bishop, his=20

Majesty commands that if you have anything to say concerning the Indies you=
 shall speak."  The=20

Bishop of Darien rose and began with an eloquent exordium in the classical =
style customary in=20

such discourses at that time and which produced the best impression on his =
hearers.  He declared=20

that he had long desired the honour of appearing in the royal presence, and=
 now that God had=20

satisfied his wish, he recognised that facies Priami digna erat imperio, wh=
ich was a graceful=20

reference to the Imperial dignity to which the young monarch had recently b=
een elected in=20

Germany.  He asked, however, that as the matters he had to present to his M=
ajesty's attention=20

were of a private nature, all those present who were not members of the Cou=
ncil should be=20

ordered to withdraw.  The Chancellor signed to him to be seated and again h=
e and M. de Chievres=20

approached the throne with the same ceremonial and after having received th=
e royal commands,=20

sotto voce, they returned to their places and the Chancellor said, "Reveren=
d Bishop, his Majesty=20

commands that if you have anything to say, you shall speak." The Bishop how=
ever repeated his=20

demand that all those not of the Council should withdraw, and a third time =
the Chancellor and M.=20

de Chievres went through the ceremony of receiving the royal commands. Agai=
n the Chancellor,=20

when he resumed his place, said, "Reverend Bishop, his Majesty commands tha=
t if you have=20

anything to say, you shall speak, for all here present have been called to =
be of this Council."  The=20

Bishop's efforts to exclude Las Casas and the Franciscan being thus defeate=
d, for it was=20

impossible for him to insist further, he began as follows: "Most potent lor=
d, the Catholic King, your=20

grandfather (may he rest in holy glory) commanded the construction of an ar=
mada to go and make=20

settlements on the mainland of the Indies and solicited our very Holy Fathe=
r to create me Bishop=20

of that first settlement; besides the time occupied in coming and going, I =
have been there five=20

years, and as a numerous company went and we only had provisions enough for=
 the journey, all=20

the rest of our people died of hunger: the remainder of us who survived, in=
 order to escape the fate=20

of the others, have done nothing during all that time but rob and kill and =
eat.  As I perceived that=20

that country was going to perdition and that its first governor was bad and=
 the second worse, I=20

determined to return and report these things to our King and Lord in whom i=
s all the hope of a=20

remedy.  As for the Indians, judging by the accounts of those in that count=
ry whence I come, and=20

those of others whom I saw on my way, they are a natura slaves."  The remai=
nder of this speech=20

has not been preserved, but the opening of it was singular enough, consider=
ing that it was=20

delivered by the advocate of the colonists and one of the bitterest opponen=
ts of Las Casas. At its=20

conclusion the ceremony of taking the royal orders was repeated and the Cha=
ncellor commanded=20

Micer Bartholomew in the King's name to speak.  The speech which Las Casas =
then delivered is=20

given, in part, in the third part of his _Historia General_. (38) In it he =
declared that he had accepted=20

his vocation not to please the King but to serve God and that he renounced,=
 once for all, any=20

temporal honour or favour his Majesty might ever wish to confer upon him.  =
A remarkably bold=20

sentence followed: "It is positive, speaking with all the respect and rever=
ence due to so great a=20

King and Lord, that I would not move from here to that corner to serve your=
 Majesty, saving my=20



fidelity as a subject, unless I thought and believed I would render service=
 to God by so doing."=20

The chief point in the Bishop's discourse which he controverted, was the as=
sertion that the Indians=20

were by nature slaves.  He was supported throughout, and especially on this=
 point, by the=20

Franciscan; and even the Admiral Diego Columbus, who had himself invalid sm=
iled.  Caro was=20

feeling a little shy, and the smile put her at her ease. She had lived all =
her life among people who=20

loved and petted her, and it did not enter her mind that she could be unwel=
come anywhere unless=20

she was naughty.  =E2=80=9CI thought maybe you=E2=80=99d like to see him,=
=E2=80=9D she explained.  =E2=80=9CHe is very handsome;=20

is he your cat?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy just see! He likes you,=E2=80=9D Car=
o exclaimed, as after a few preliminary turns,=20

Trolley curled himself up on the soft rugs and began to purr, thus expressi=
ng his unqualified=20

approval of this resting place.  =E2=80=9CAren=E2=80=99t you the little gir=
l I saw on the fence the other day? Why did=20

you run away?=E2=80=9D  Caro laughed; =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t know,=E2=80=
=9D she said; and then feeling that her presence to-day=20

needed to be explained more fully, she added, =E2=80=9CI thought maybe you=
=E2=80=99d like to see Trolley, because=20

he is such a comfort to me when I am lonely.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd did you=
 think I was lonely?=E2=80=9D There was a cloud=20

on the young man=E2=80=99s face as he spoke.  =E2=80=9CI thought you must b=
e,=E2=80=9D she said simply, =E2=80=9Cbecause you=20

can=E2=80=99t go everywhere.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen why are you lonely? Yo=
u can go where you please.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut I miss=20

mamma and papa and the boys sometimes, and then--=E2=80=9D she leaned again=
st his chair and spoke in=20

a confidential tone, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m afraid of the dark.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CSo am I,=E2=80=9D Walter remarked gravely.  =E2=80=9CAre you? I didn=
=E2=80=99t=20

know grown up people ever were--but if you=E2=80=99ll just get a candle you=
 won=E2=80=99t be--any more. The dark=20

is very nice when you can see it.=E2=80=9D  As Walter seemed interested, wa=
tching her gravely as he=20

stroked Trolley, Caro went on to explain more fully about the candle, and h=
ow her grandfather had=20

said she could be one herself. =E2=80=9CAnd so,=E2=80=9D she concluded, =E2=
=80=9CI thought Trolley might be a candle too,=20

and bring you a little cheer.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am much obliged. What do=
 you say his name is?=E2=80=9D Walter asked.=20

=E2=80=9CCousin Charlie named him for the trolley cars; wasn=E2=80=99t that=
 funny? And he used to live here you=20

know--that is why I thought you would like to see him. He came to our house=
 and just _would_=20

stay, though Aunt Charlotte sent him back ever so many times.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CI believe I do recall something of=20

the kind. He was one of my sister=E2=80=99s pets.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDo you=
 suppose she=E2=80=99d like to see him?=E2=80=9D Caro asked.  A=20

smile flitted across Walter=E2=80=99s face as he replied, =E2=80=9CI really=
 don=E2=80=99t know; she is out this morning.=E2=80=9D  The=20

conversation was brought to an end by the appearance of Thompson, who was n=
o doubt greatly=20

surprised to find a little girl and a striped cat with his master.  =E2=80=
=9CI think I=E2=80=99d better go,=E2=80=9D Caro said,=20

=E2=80=9CAunt Charlotte might want me, but Trolley can stay awhile if you=
=E2=80=99d like to have him.=E2=80=9D  Trolley as if=20

to expostulate against being disturbed, tucked his head almost out of sight=
 and curled up tighter=20

than before. No one could have had the heart to disturb him.  =E2=80=9CShe =
is the child we saw on the=20

fence the other day, Thompson,=E2=80=9D Mr. Grayson explained as Caro ran o=
ff.  =E2=80=9CYes, sir;=E2=80=9D Thompson=20

replied, watching till the red jacket disappeared in the distance; =E2=80=
=9CShe=E2=80=99s visiting here--she=E2=80=99s Dr.=20

Barrow=E2=80=99s granddaughter; I have seen her playing about. Shall I take=
 you down through the garden=20

sir?=E2=80=9D  As he was wheeled along the sunny path there was a smile on =
Walter=E2=80=99s face. Caro had been=20

right, he was lonely, and after the first moment he had not resented her sy=
mpathy, and now the=20

pressure of Trolley=E2=80=99s very substantial frame against his arm, the t=
hought of the little girl=E2=80=99s face as=20

she told about her candle, gave him a new sense of companionship. When he h=
ad said he too was=20

afraid of the dark, he was thinking of the future which once had been so br=
ight to him, and over=20

which the clouds had gathered so heavily; but a little cheer had found its =
way to his heart, and he=20

could smile.  =E2=80=9CThompson, you needn=E2=80=99t mention it to Miss Eli=
zabeth,--the child having been here I=20



mean--it might annoy her.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo sir;=E2=80=9D was the reply=
. =E2=80=9CAnd I hope she=E2=80=99ll come again,=E2=80=9D he added to=20

himself, for he did not approve of the dreary, shut-in life led by his mast=
er.     CHAPTER VI  A=20

LOCAL SNOW STORM   After Caro reached home she began to be afraid that Trol=
ley would not=20

come back and the thought made her rather unhappy, but just as the lunch be=
ll rang he came=20

trotting across the lawn. She was watching at the window and ran to open th=
e door, giving him=20

such a warm welcome that the president who saw it, remarked to Aunt Charlot=
te, =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t know=20

what Caro would do without that cat.=E2=80=9D  That very day Dr. Barrows le=
ft=20


_
indeed initiated the very abuses which were being denounced, bore witness t=
o the truth of his=20

statements and the weight of his arguments.  When Las Casas had finished, Q=
uevedo, who=20

expressed his wish to reply, was notified that anything further he had to s=
ay must be submitted in=20

writing.  This closed the audience and the King withdrew.  In conformity wi=
th the King's order that=20

his answer to Las Casas should be presented in writing the Bishop of Darien=
 prepared two=20

statements, one of which set forth all the various abuses and the destructi=
on caused by the=20

Spaniards in that colony, while the other contained suggestions for remedyi=
ng those evils; one of=20

these remedies was the prohibition of the customary raids amongst the India=
n tribes and the other=20

was that the peaceable Indians should be induced to live in villages where =
they might be taught,=20

and also pay some tribute to the Crown.  The Bishop's view of the lamentabl=
e state of things in the=20

colony, his condemnation of the violent conduct of the Spaniards, and his o=
pinion that it was=20

urgent to introduce a new system for regulating the relations between the c=
olonists and natives=20

seem not to have differed from those of Las Casas himself, and both the cor=
rective measures he=20

proposed met with the latter's hearty approval.  These memorials were first=
 read by the Bishop to=20

the Chancellor and M. Laxao, both of whom were highly satisfied to discover=
 such unexpected=20

conformity several weeks. Hard times had effected the seminary, an effort m=
ust be made to=20

increase its funds, and this was the task the president had before him. In =
this way it happened that=20

he heard nothing of the visit to Walter Grayson.  Caro missed him very much=
, for although she and=20

Aunt Charlotte were beginning to understand each other, they would never be=
 the intimate friends=20

she and her grandfather were.  When Marjorie heard the story she exclaimed,=
 =E2=80=9CWhy Caro! You=20

had better not let Aunt Charlotte know; she=E2=80=99ll scold you like every=
thing.=E2=80=9D  Caro was puzzled. Her=20

grandfather had said he was sorry for the Graysons and wished he could do s=
omething for them.=20

She had thought of something--surely this couldn=E2=80=99t be wrong, and ye=
t she felt Marjorie was=20

probably right when she said Aunt Charlotte would not approve.  About this =
time the little girls=20

began to have lessons together every morning, sitting in small chairs on ei=
ther side of the cutting=20

table in their aunt=E2=80=99s bedroom. They read from a small green volume =
called =E2=80=9CLittle Annie=E2=80=99s Third=20

Book,=E2=80=9D a favorite of Aunt Charlotte=E2=80=99s, from which she had t=
aught the children of the family for the=20

last forty years. Caro privately thought it rather silly, but accepted it b=
ecause mamma had read in it=20

when she was little.  Caro meant to try very hard while grandpa was away, t=
o be a pleasure and=20

not an annoyance to her aunt and Jane, so she might have a good report for =
him when he=20

returned.=20


_
clerigo.  When asked by them what he thought of Las Casas's projects, the B=
ishop replied that he=20

found them excellent and most just.  This singular conversion of the Bishop=
 of Darien from a=20

formidable opponent into a supporter, delighted Las Casas, who, when the Ch=
ancellor showed=20

him the two memorials, asked for a pen that he too might sign them, saying:=
 "Did I ever tell your=20

lordship more than the Bishop has here admitted? What greater cruelties, mu=
rders, and=20

destruction in that so well that Aunt Charlotte remarked to her sister-in-l=
aw, Marjorie=E2=80=99s mother, that=20

she had never known two better children than those little girls.  Alas! it =
was not long before she=20

was compelled to change her opinion.  One afternoon when the ground was dam=
p and Marjorie=20

had a cold, Miss Barrows told them they might play in the garret. It happen=
ed to be her reception=20

day, and up there, she thought, with the door closed they might make all th=
e noise they pleased=20

without disturbing the=20


_
have I ever reported to your lordship than these?"  What influence worked u=
pon Quevedo does not=20

appear; whether he perceived that the King looked with sympathy on the enth=
usiastic Las Casas=20

and that the latter was high in favour with the important Flemish group at =
Court and therefore sure=20

to carry his point, and so decided, as a practised courtier, to pass over t=
o the winning side, or=20

repose of her drawing room.  Little Tom who as usual was hanging around, wa=
s graciously invited=20

in, and the three ran off in high spirits.  =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think =
there is anything there they can possibly hurt,=E2=80=9D=20

Aunt Charlotte said to herself.  Now in this long, low room, near the front=
 windows was an old four=20

post bedstead, upon which was a large feather bed. It had not been in use f=
or a long=20
