darling, you are not going to leave me by myself, for I really don't feel w=

back ever so quickly, Eyebright, but I really think I must do Primrose's sh=
opping for her, now that I=20

am not going to Miss Egerton. Primrose is working very hard at her china-pa=
inting order, and it is=20

not fair she should be interrupted. You won't be selfish, will you, Eyebrig=
ht? You know we=20

arranged long ago that the way you were to help matters forward was not to =
hinder us older girls in=20

our work."  "I know," answered Daisy, with a patient sigh. "I won't be self=
ish, Jasmine. Just kiss me=20

before you go."  Jasmine went away, and Daisy, taking the Pink into her arm=
s, sat down close to=20

the fire. She was not exactly nervous, but she scarcely liked to be left in=
 the attics by herself. She=20

wished Mrs. Dove would come up, or even that Tommy Dove, who was a rude boy=
, and whom, as=20

a rule, she particularly disliked, would pay her a visit. Any company, howe=
ver she reflected, would=20

be better than none, for she was feeling heavy and depressed with her cold.=
 The warm feel of the=20

Pink's furry little body, elapsed tightly in her arms, comforted her not a =
little. She remembered with=20

some satisfaction that Jasmine had locked the door, and she began already t=
o count the moments=20

for her sister's return.  An hour passed, and still Daisy listened for Jasm=
ine's light and springing=20

step on the attic stairs.  She was very tired now, and her head ached. She =
thought she would go=20

into the bedroom and, lying down on her little white bed, sleep away the we=
ary moments. Taking=20

the Pink with her, she did so, wrapping the counterpane well up over them b=
oth.  In a very few=20

moments the child was in a heavy slumber.  She awoke, after what seemed to =
herself a very short=20

nap, to hear sounds in the bedroom. She stirred sleepily, and, opening her =
eyes, said--  "Oh,=20

Jasmine, what a time you've been away!"  No answer from Jasmine, but a smot=
hered exclamation=20

from some one else; a heavy tread on the uncarpeted boards, and Dove, his f=
ace red, his shoes=20

off, and something which looked like a screw-driver in his hands, came up a=
nd bent over the child.=20

"Oh! what are you doing here, Mr. Dove?" exclaimed little Daisy. The man be=
nt down over her,=20

and stared hard into her wide open blue eyes.  [Illustration: THE MAN BENT =
DOWN OVER HER.=20

to feign sleep like that--it=20

was very cunning and over sharp, but it don't come round me. No, no; you ha=

now, and say what you has seen, and what you hasn't seen. I allow of no non=
sense with little girls,=20

and I can  The swelling began to disappear according to the prophecy of the=
 housekeeper, but the=20

skin took on the color of the reddened water in the basin. An hour later Mr=
. McGowan was=20

undecided which was the more undesirable, the pain from the sprain, or the =
blisters from the=20

treatment.  "Cal'late I'll run down to the _Jennie P._," announced the Capt=
ain after breakfast. "You=20

can't navigate that far, can you, Mack?"  "Josiah Pott! What on earth do yo=
u mean? Of course he=20

can't, and you know it. I don't see what you want to go traipsing down to t=
hat thing for, anyhow; it=20

ain't going to get loose, though it'd be a good loss if it did."  "It ain't=
 likely she'll get away, that's=20

sartin sure, but I thought I'd do a little work on her. I ain't had much ti=
me afore now, with all my=20

cooking and keeping house. The minister said my engine wa'n't clean."  "Wel=
l, if you ain't been=20

cooking better than you've been keeping house, the wonder is you ain't both=
 dead," she said,=20

peering about the room.  Fearing further comment, the Captain hastily left =
the house. On reaching=20

the wharf, he was surprised to see Elizabeth walking from the far end to me=
et him.  "Morning,=20

Beth. Out purty early for your constitutional, ain't you?"  "Good morning, =
Uncle Josiah. I've been=20

waiting for you an awful long time. Are you going out to the _Jennie P._?" =
 "That's my calculation.=20

Want to go along?"  "If I may."  "Of course you can. Did you leave somethin=
g aboard last night?"=20



"No. I just came down here on purpose to see you. I felt certain you would =
be going out."  "You=20

come down just to see me? What do you want to see an old feller like me for=
? Now, if it was----"=20

"You, old! Who's been telling you that?"  "Nobody, 'cepting this infernal r=
heumatism. But I ain't=20

quite as badly crippled up this morning as the preacher is, at that."  "Do =
you mean to say that the=20

minister has the rheumatism?"  "No, he ain't got nothing as tame or ordinar=
y as that. He started=20

with a sprained j'int from the cruise, but he's going to have something far=
 worse, if I don't miss my=20

guess. Clemmie's been soaking his ankle in red pepper." He chuckled quietly=
 as he helped=20

Elizabeth into the dory.  "Soaking his foot in red pepper?"  "Yes. Hot as f=
ire, too, it was. I asked if=20

she didn't have the water a mite too red, but she said it wa'n't, and I cal=
'late she'd otter know."=20

"Isn't she the quaintest little woman? I remember her when I was a child, b=
ut she didn't like me=20

one bit because I spilled some hot water on her once. Is she going to stay =
with you?"  "She's going=20

to keep house," replied the Captain, drawing the dory alongside his power-b=
oat. "Well, here we be,=20

Beth."=20

a lie. You know where the children who tell lies go to, so you'd better spe=
ak up, and the whole=20

truth, missie." Dove spoke in a very rough voice, and poor Daisy felt terri=
bly frightened.  "I didn't=20

see anything," she began, in her innocent way. "I was fast, fast asleep. I =
thought you were=20

Jasmine--Jasmine should have been back long ago. I have a bad cold, and I w=
as trying to pass=20

the time by going to sleep. I haven't seen anything, Mr. Dove."  "Let me lo=
ok into your eyes, miss,"=20

said Dove; "open them wide, and let me look well into them."  "Oh! you frig=
hten me, Mr. Dove,"=20

said Daisy, beginning to cry. "I was very lonely, and I'd have liked you to=
 come up half an hour=20

ago; but you look so queer now, and you speak in such a  Elizabeth sprang l=
ightly over the side.=20

She led the way to the roof of the cabin, where she sat down. When the Capt=
ain had taken his=20

place at her side, she looked up eagerly into his eyes.  "I do so hope you =
will understand me,=20

Uncle Josiah!"  "I've always tried to, Beth."  "I know you have! Tell me, d=
id my--did any one you=20

know have anything to do with making up that boxing match the other night?"=
  "There was a good=20

many that had to do with it, unless I'm 'way off in my reckoning."  "Has Mr=
. McGowan said=20

anything about Father in connection with the affair?"  "He ain't said nothi=
ng to me," responded the=20

Captain.  "Uncle Josiah!" exclaimed the girl, her eyes growing wide in her =
earnestness. "I know=20
