his feet held to the fire so they could dry. He also said his 'mammy' would=
 rub grease under the=20

soles of his feet to keep him from taking cold.  It seemed to the child tha=
t he had just gone to bed=20

when the old tallow candle was lighted and his 'pappy' arose and fell upon =
his knees and prayed=20

aloud for God's blessings and thanked him for another day. The field hands =
were to be in the field=20

by five o'clock and it meant to rise before day, summer and winter. Not so =
bad in summer for it=20

was soon day but in winter the weather was cold and darkness was longer res=
tored. There is a=20

spell in mediaeval Art which has had power to bewitch some people into tryi=
ng, or wishing to try, or=20

fancying that they wish to try or making believe to fancy that they wish to=
 try, to bring back the=20

Middle Ages. You may hear pinings for the return of an age of force from ge=
ntle aestheticists, who,=20

if the awe of force did return, would certainly be crushed like eggshells. =
There is a well-known tale=20

by Hans Andersen, that great though child-like teacher, called the "Oversho=
es of Fortune." A=20

gentleman, at an evening party, has been=20


_
When daylight came field hands had been working an hour or more. Robert Lee=
, Randall's father=20

was an overseer and it meant for him to be up and out with the rest of the =
men so he could see if=20

things were going allright.  The Randall children were not forced up early =
because they did not eat=20

breakfast with their 'pappy'. Their mother was dining-room girl in her mist=
ress' house, so fed the=20

children right from the Miller table. There was no objection offered to thi=
s.  Doctor Miller was kind=20

but he did not want his slaves enlightened too much. Therefore, he did not =
allow much preaching=20

in the church. They could have prayer meeting all they wanted to, but instr=
uctions from the Ages.=20

In going away he unwittingly puts on the fairy overshoes, which have the gi=
ft of transporting the=20

wearer at once to any place and time where he wishes to be. Stepping out he=
 finds his own wish=20

fulfilled--he is in the Middle Ages. There is no gas, the street is pitch d=
ark, he is up to his ankles in=20

mud, he is nearly knocked into the kennel by a mediaeval bishop returning f=
rom a revel with his=20

roystering train, when he wants to cross the river there is no bridge; and =
after vainly inquiring his=20

way in a tavern full of very rough customers, he wishes himself in the moon=
, and to the moon=20

appropriately he goes. Mediaevalism can hardly be called anything but a rat=
her=20


_
become too wise and get it into their heads to ran away and get free.  Ther=
e was talk about=20

freedom and Doctor Miller knew it would be only a matter of time when he wo=
uld loose all his=20

slaves. He said to Randall's mother one day, "Delhia you'll soon be as free=
 as I am." She said.=20

"Sho' nuf massy?" and he answered. "You sure will." Nothing more was said t=
o any of the slaves=20

until Sherman's army came through notifying the slaves they were free.  The=
 presence of the=20

soldiers caused such a comotion around the plantation that Randall's mind w=
as indelibly=20

impressed with their doings.  The northern soldiers took all the food they =
could get their hands on=20

and took possession of the cattle and horses and mules. Levi, the brother o=
f Randall, and who=20

was named after his paternal grandfather, was put on a mule and the mule lo=
aded with provisions=20

and sent two miles to the soldier's camp. Levi liked that, for beside being=
 well treated he received=20

several pieces of money. The federal soldiers played with him and gave him =
all the food he=20

wanted, although the Miller slaves and their children were fed and there wa=
s no reason for the=20

child to be hungry.  Levi Lee, the grandfather a real effort to live in the=
 Middle Ages, your life would=20

be one perpetual prevarication. You would be drawn by the steam engine to l=
ecture against steam;=20

you would send eloquent invectives against printing to the press, and you w=
ould be subsisting=20

meanwhile on the interest of investments which the Middle Ages would have c=
ondemned as usury.=20

If you were like some of the school, you would praise the golden silence of=
 the Dark Ages and be=20

talking all the time. And surely the hourly failure to act up to your princ=
iples, the hourly and=20

conscious apostacy from your ideal, could beget nothing in the character bu=
t hollowness and=20

weakness. No student of history can fail to see the moral interest of the M=
iddle Ages, any more=20

than an artist can fail to see their aesthetic interest. There were some sp=
ecial types of noble=20

character then, of which, when they were done with, nature broke the mould.=
 But the mould is=20

broken, and it is broken for ever. Through aesthetic pining for a past age,=
 we may become unjust=20

to our own, and thus weaken our practical sense of duty, and lessen our pow=
er of doing good. I=20

will call the age bad when it makes me so, is a wise saying, and worth all=

the soldiers were encamped round about the place. He dreamed that a pot of =
money was buried in=20

a certain place; the person who showed it to him told him to go dig for it =
on the first rainy night. He=20

kept the dream a secret and on the first rainy night he went, dug, and foun=
d the pot of money right=20

where his dream had told him it same thing in other words, our age will be =
good enough for most=20

of us, if there is genuine goodness in ourselves. Rousseau fancied he was s=
oaring above his age,=20

not into the thirteenth century, but into the state of nature, while he was=
 falling miserably below his=20

own age in all the common duties and relations of life; and he was a=20


_
money to his cabin and told no one anything about it. He hid it as securely=
 as possible, but when=20

the soldiers were searching for gold and silver money they did not leave th=
e Negro's cabin out of=20

the search. When they found the money they thought Levi's master had given =
him enthusiasts, for=20

enthusiasm leads to action, but of mere social dreamers. Where there is dut=
y, there is poetry, and=20

tragedy too, in plenty, though it be in the most prosaic row of dingy littl=
e brick houses with clothes=20

hanging out to dry, or rather to be wetted, behind them,=20
