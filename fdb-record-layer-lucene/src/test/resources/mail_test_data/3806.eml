"And I'd about as soon be dead as to miss that." Jack's gloom deepened. Occ=
asionally during his=20

watch, when he listened in vain for the sound of a rescue plane, the though=
t of the "Big Show" and=20

the part he wanted to play in it became a definite goal.  Only the night be=
fore, the ship's=20

commander had said to him, "We've got a little job to do down south of here=
. Then, I hope, we're=20

due to join the big push for the grandest show of all."  Yes! The "Big Show=
"! Whispers had gone=20

around the ship. For two whole weeks rumors had been crystallizing into fac=
ts. They would join=20

other task forces, a dozen carriers, some big battle wagons, a hundred--per=
haps two hundred--

fighting ships, scores of transports and cargo ships, as well as many fast =
PT boats. Then all=20

together, with the greatest fighting force the world had ever known, they w=
ould go after Mindanao.=20

And what was Mindanao? For the fiftieth these boxes opposite the muzzle of =
the gun, leaning=20

forward, his arms crossed upon the handle of his umbrella, had his arm brok=
en above the elbow=20

immediately upon its discharge. Several portions of wadding were found bene=
ath the place where=20

the man sat, but no marks existed upon his clothing nor upon the anterior p=
art of the arm, which=20

must have been inaccessible to any projectile that did not first strike the=
 forearm. It was concluded=20

that the fracture had been caused by the violent and sudden starting of the=
 man backward, which=20

must have brought his arm against the hard part of the partition. An experi=
ment tried with the=20

cannon proved that any wadding that could be made with paper was dispersed =
in passing, or lost=20

all power of mischief, at much less distance than one hundred and twenty fe=

"MacArthur said he'd go back, and now we're going," Stew said soberly.  "Wh=
at do you mean,=20

'we'?" Jack demanded bitterly. "Looks as if we're stuck right here."  "I'll=
 be there if I have to swim!"=20

Stew vowed.  "All right. Suppose you sit up for a while and think that one =
over," Jack suggested,=20

"while I grab three winks of sleep."                                   CHAP=
TER VIII                        A LOOK AT=20

A MYSTERY PLANE   Jack awoke with a start. The hot tropical sun shone on hi=
s face. Despite the=20

threat of danger, he had slept soundly.  "Huh!" He sat up suddenly to find =
Stew laughing at him.=20

"That dream of yours must have been a humdinger!" Stew exclaimed. "You were=
 grinning from ear=20

to ear in your sleep."  "Quite a dream," Jack admitted. "I was back on my u=
ncle's farm. It was=20

morning. Birds were singing, and a rooster crowing."  "He still is." Stew c=
huckled.  "Who still is=20

what?" Jack stared.  "The rooster's still crowing. Listen."  Jack listened,=
 and sure enough, there=20

came the lusty crow of a rooster.  "People!" Jack stood up. "Our island has=
 inhabitants! Where=20

there's chickens there's folks! What do you know about that? Shall we look =
them up?"  "Wait a=20

minute!" said Stew in a puzzled tone. "You can't be sure there are people o=
n these islands. Those=20

chickens may be wild."  "Perhaps they are," Jack agreed. "But that fellow w=
ho flies the howling=20

plane must be human, so we'd better watch our step, since that means there'=
s someone on the=20

island."  "I meant native people," Stew corrected. "Many of these small isl=
ands are deserted now.=20

The natives went to larger islands, or the Japs have taken them off. Perhap=
s it's true here."=20

"Could be," said Jack, "but if we don't look up the natives or whoever is o=
n this place, how'll we=20

eat?"  "I guess it's emergency rations for us," Stew replied. "But that's n=
ot so bad. We've got=20

matches for a fire and there's powdered coffee."  "Coffee! Boy! Lead me to =
it!" Jack jumped up. "If=20

you'll make a small fire and get the coffee ready, I'll look around a littl=
e and see what our=20

possibilities are."  "And I'm going to have a look at that screamer today o=
r know the reason why!"=20

Stew told himself as he collected dried shreds of palm fronds, coconut shuc=
ks, and splinters of=20

wood for a fire.  The crowing rooster had become mysteriously silent. Convi=
nced by this fact that=20

he must be wild, Jack climbed over boulders and forced his way through bria=
r patches to reach at=20

last the crest of the ridge.  Not wishing to expose himself to so broad a v=
iew, he threw himself=20

down on a broad rock, then dragged himself forward for a view of the land t=
hat lay beyond. He let=20

out a gasp of surprise.  Beneath him was a lower ridge, and on of the rifle=
-bullets used in the most=20

recently invented improved arms. The last new projectile used in the German=
 army, 1892, with the=20

Mannlicher rifle, has an inner core of lead inclosed in a casing of steel o=
r firm metal, which=20

prevents the lead, even when softened by heat, from becoming deformed and e=
nlarged by=20

contact. The weight of the bullet is much less than any of the old, but to =
its higher rate of velocity=20

and its pointed shape, which is preserved, must be ascribed its greater per=
forating power. Owing=20

to this immense velocity and the small surface of contact, it meets with li=
ttle resistance on striking=20

a person, has no time to stretch the various tissues it encounters, causes =
little or no commotion of=20

the neighboring parts, and merely punches a hole, carrying the contused ele=
ments before it clear=20

out of the wound without seriously damaging the surrounding wall of the bul=
let-track. This absence=20

of contusion must lead to more frequent deaths from hemorrhage, while when =
this arm is used we=20

shall hear very little of deflection or deviation of the bullet from its pa=
th, since it has sufficient=20

power to pass directly through any part of the body which it may meet on it=
s way. The result in=20

battle will be a reduction of the list of wounded, but a terrible augmentat=
ion of that of the dead.=20



IDENTITY FROM A FLASH OF GUNPOWDER.  Taylor states the following: =E2=80=9C=
Among the singular=20

questions which have arisen out of this subject is the following: whether t=
he person who fires a=20

gun or pistol during a dark night can be identified by means of the light p=
roduced during the=20

discharge. This question was first negatively answered by a class in physic=
al science in France,=20

whereas later a case tending to show that their decision was erroneous was =
subsequently=20

reported by Fodere. A woman positively swore that she saw the face of the p=
risoner, who fired at=20

another during the night, surrounded by a kind of glory, and that she was t=
hereby enabled to=20

identify him. This statement was confirmed by the deposition of the wounded=
 party. Desgranges,=20

of Lyons, performed many experiments on this subject, and he concluded that=
 away from every=20

source of light the prisoner who fired the gun might be identified within a=
 moderate distance; if the=20

flash were very strong, the smoke very dense, and the distance great, the p=
erson firing the piece=20

could not be identified. The question was raised in England in the case of =
Reg. _v._ White at the=20

Croydon Autumn Assizes, 1839. A gentleman was shot at while driving home on=
 a dark night,=20

being wounded in the leg. When he saw the flash of the gun he saw that the =
piece was levelled=20

toward him, and the light of the flash enabled him to recognize at once the=
 features of the=20

accused. In cross-examination he said he was quite sure he could see the pr=
isoner=20


_
backs to him, gazing off at the sea, were two native girls. He knew too lit=
tle about native girls to=20

judge their ages, but both seemed fully grown. They wore short, loose dress=
es of bright-colored=20

cotton.  The two girls were so strangely different that it seemed they coul=
d hardly belong to the=20

same tribe. "And yet," the boy reasoned, "they must." Both were quite dark,=
 but there the similarity=20

ended. One was short and stocky, with a mop of black hair that stood out al=
l around her head.=20

"Regular fuzzy-wuzzy," Jack told himself.  The other girl was rather slende=
r, and her hair, though=20

black and curly, had a tendency to lie down.  The short stout one held a li=
ve chicken by its feet.=20

"There goes our rooster," Jack thought.  The tall girl had a bunch of small=
 wild bananas slung over=20

her shoulder.  "Oh, well," he thought, "they may have left a accused was sk=
ilfully defended and he=20

was acquitted. A similar case was tried at the Lewes Lent Assizes, 1862, Re=
g. _v._ Stapley. The=20

prisoner shot at the prosecutor on a dark December evening, and the latter =
swore that he distinctly=20

saw the prisoner by the flash of the gun and could identify him by the ligh=
t on his features. His=20

evidence was corroborated and the man was convicted. A case is also quoted,=
 Rex _v._ Haines,=20

in which some police officials were shot at by a highwayman during a dark n=
ight. One of these=20

stated that he could distinctly see from the flash of the pistol that the r=
obber rode a dark-brown=20

horse of remarkable shape, and that he had since identified the horse at a =
stable in London. He=20

also was positive that the prisoner had on a rough brown great-coat.  There=
 seems to be enough=20

evidence in this direction to show that=20


_
the stalk near here."  Just then the tall, slender girl, turned halfway aro=
und. Startled, not wishing to=20

be seen, Jack drew back.  When he looked again the two girls were walking a=
long the rocks. He=20

got a profile view of them. "Yes," he thought, "they are very different." B=
oth were barefoot, but the=20

tall one walked with a joyous spring, while the other one just plodded alon=
g. With a laugh the tall=20

girl lifted the bunch of bananas to her head, then, with this crown, she mo=
ved away as regally as a=20

queen.  When they had vanished into the bushes he slid back down the rock t=
o his own side of the=20

ridge. After following the ridge for a short distance he took a different r=
oute toward their beach.  To=20

his great joy, half way there he came upon a cluster of banana plants growi=
ng in a narrow run.  A=20

small stream went trickling and tumbling down the center of the run. Taking=
 a collapsible drinking=20

cup from his pocket, he bent over a pool to fill the cup, then   GENERAL ME=
DICO-LEGAL=20

CONSIDERATIONS.  The result of the wonderful advance in the practice of sur=
gery made during=20

the past fifteen years has been in a large measure to revolutionize the tre=
atment of gunshot=20

wounds, and inasmuch as the result of many homicidal attempts will depend i=
n large measure=20

upon what the surgeon can do for the victim of assault, it may not be amiss=
 to very briefly=20

epitomize in this place something of what modern surgeons believe with rega=
rd to the best=20

treatment of bullet-wounds, expressed in a general way. They have learned, =
among other things,=20

that the harm which a bullet does is done by it during its flight, and that=
 after it has come to a stop=20

it is, _per se_, an almost invariably harmless foreign body. This is practi=
cally always the case=20

unless it has carried in with it foreign material which may serve as a sour=
ce of septic infection.  In=20

time past there has always been a strong feeling, which had, however, nothi=
ng=20


_
was the fresh imprint of a bare foot.  "They've been on our side of the rid=
ge," he told himself. "Half=20

way down the slope. I wonder if they saw us?" This discovery disturbed him.=
 One never could tell=20

about natives in these wild islands.  The water was fresh and cold.  "Umm! =
Cold spring!" he=20

murmured. "Water supply." He made a mental note--he must follow that stream=
 back to its source.=20

When he arrived at the banana patch, he discovered more evidence of their v=
isitors, if they might=20

be called that. One banana plant was minus a freshly cut bunch of bananas. =
 Selecting a fine=20

bunch that was still green, he cut it off with a sheath knife, shouldered i=
t, and went back down the=20

ridge.  "We're not alone here," he said, when he reached camp.  "How come?"=
 Stew asked.=20

"Natives beat us here. I saw two of them. They had our rooster. But I got s=
ome bananas."  "I see,"=20

said Stew. "How come you picked green ones?"  "They'll be all right when th=
ey ripen," Jack=20

explained. "When they ripen on the plant, bananas are not fit to eat. They =
lose their flavor and=20

become tasteless; also the skin bursts open and the ripening a poisoned one=
. Of late, since=20

bacteriology has attained the proportion of a science, it has been held tha=
t bullets were=20

necessarily sterilized by the heat of the discharge of powder behind them. =
Very recently Dr. B. Von=20

Beck, Medical Director of the 14th German Army Corps, has made experiments =
upon the amount=20

of heat imparted to leaden and other bullets after firing. After making an =
allowance for specific heat=20

and the conductivity of the different metals used, he found that even when =
the projectiles=20

encountered resistance from three to four times greater than that offered b=
y the human body the=20

results were as follows: Temperature of leaden bullets of .45 calibre, when=
 recovered, 69=C2=B0 C.; of=20

.30 calibre, covered with steel, when recovered, 78=C2=B0 C.; of .30 calibr=
e, covered with copper, when=20

recovered, 101=C2=B0 C. He states that these experiments disprove the theor=
y that certain lesions in=20

wounds can be in any way attributed to the heat imparted by the bullet.  Wh=
ile these experiments=20

prove that the bullets may be heated to the above degrees when recovered, t=
hey by no means=20

prove that they are so heated at=20
