CHAPTER X   MAXINE DRIVES WITH THE ENEMY  When Raoul was gone I dracaena marginata a different wife she had been from Persis!

nearer to heaven on that evening than she had ever been before in her life, and yet that there was 

some terrible, impassable barrier shutting her out from closer approach.  "Now I must go home," 

she remarked in a tone of regret.  "But you will come again and take tea with us to-morrow," said 

Persis, after asking Ned's consent with a glance, and receiving it in a smile. "Mr. Sands will not be 

back till Thursday."  "Yes, I'll come; you're very kind," replied Nancy, wondering what could make 

her company desired by one like Franks, to whom she had shown so much rudeness, or by his 

wife, who was herself such a pattern of sobriety and quiet behavior.  "I'll convoy you home," said 

Ned Franks, taking down his cap from its peg.  "Oh, dear, no. I could find my way blindfold, and 

there's clear moonlight to-night."  "I'll see you safe in port," said the sailor, with quiet firmness. He 

remembered that the "Blue Boar" must be passed on the road.  It was a night of exquisite beauty. 

The softness of the breeze, the silvery light of the moon, seemed in perfect harmony with the 

holier feelings which had been wakened in Nancy's breast by the sight of a Christian home.  "You 

are very happy," she abruptly observed, as she walked by the sailor's side.  "We _are_ happy," 

was the brief but fervent reply.  "Perhaps clocks do go better with weights after all," muttered 

Nancy; a remark which to Ned sounded so odd, and so utterly foreign to their subject, that, had he 

not known that Nancy had had nothing stronger than his wife's good tea, he would have suspected 

that she had taken "a drop too much."  As Franks and his companion passed the church, the soft 

moonlight lay like a silvery robe on the graveyard, throwing deep shadows from the tombstones 

over the mossy mounds. Nancy heaved a low sigh;--in that quiet spot lay the remains of her only 

son.  "Life is a bitter thing," she murmured.  "It would be if this life were our all," said Franks.  The 

sentence was short but suggestive; Nancy knew that the world had been _her_ all; that she had 

thought little of, and cared less for, anything beyond the cares and pleasures of this life. She knew 

that what shed radiance on the home of Persis was not merely the domestic love and peace which 

lay on the table. It was a foolish but pretty little bag, which a friend had made and sent to me at the 

theatre a few nights ago, and was intended to carry a purse and handkerchief. But I had never 

used it yet. Now it seemed a convenient receptacle for the necklace, and I suddenly planned out 

my way of giving it to Raoul.  At first, earlier in the evening, I had meant to put the diamonds in his 

hands and say, "See what I have for you!" But now I had changed my mind, because he must be 

induced to go away as quickly as possible--quite, quite away from the theatre, so that there would 

be no danger of his seeing Count Godensky at the stage door. I was not sorry that Raoul was 

jealous, because, as he said, his jealousy was a compliment to me; and it is possible only for a 

cold man never to be jealous of a woman in my profession, who lives in the eyes of the world. But 

I did not want him to be jealous of the Russian; and he would be horribly jealous, if he thought that 

he had the least cause.  If I showed him the diamonds now, he would want to stop and talk. He 

would ask me questions which I would rather not answer until I'd seen Ivor Dundas again, and 

knew better what to say--whether truth or fiction. Still, I wished Raoul to have the necklace to-

night, because it would mean all the difference to him between constant, gnawing anxiety, and the 

joy of deliverance. Let him have a happy night, even though I was sending him away, even though 

I did not know what to-morrow might bring, either for him or for me.  I tied the gold cords of the bag 

in two hard knots, and went out with it to Raoul in the next room.  "This holds something precious," 

I said, smiling at him, and making a mystery. "You'll value the something, I know--partly for itself, 

partly because I--because I've been at a lot of trouble to get it for you. When you see it, you'll be 



more resigned not to see me--just for tonight. But you're to write me a letter, please, and describe 

accurately every one of your sensations on opening the bag. Also, you may say in your letter a few 

kind things about me, if you like. And I want it to come to me when I first wake up to-morrow 

morning. So go now, dearest, and have the sensations, and write about them. I

and that such hope, like the moon, could beautify and brighten, not only the cheerful cottage, but 

even the silent grave.  Franks was more pleased with the quiet, subdued manner in which Nancy 

bade him good-night at the door of her dwelling, than he had been with her lively conversation in 

his own. Never had Mrs. Sands felt more disgusted with the untidy aspect of her parlor than when 

she entered it on that night. How unlike it was to that minute, asleep or awake."  "Why mayn't I 

look now?" asked Raoul, taking the soft mass of pink and silver from me, in the nice, clumsy way a 

big man has of handling a woman's things.  "Because--just _because_. But perhaps you'll guess 

why, by and by," I said. Then I held up my face to be kissed, and he bundled the small bag away 

in an inside pocket of his coat, as carelessly as if it held nothing but a handkerchief and a pair of 

gloves.
