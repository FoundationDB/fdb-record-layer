hospitalities and an indulgence in such simple hilarity as the occasion see=
med to require; but "Jeff"=20

was not forgotten. Early in the morning he was bathed and scrubbed, more th=
an to his heart's=20

content, and then patriotically decorated. In his right ear was a red ribbo=
n, in his left a white one;=20

around his neck another of blue.  Thus adorned he was brought on shore to p=
ay me a visit, and as=20

he came through my door he appeared to be filled with the pride of patrioti=
sm and a realization of=20

the greatness of the occasion. His reward for this unusual demonstration wa=
s instantaneous, and=20

consisted of some apples and a toothsome dessert of sugar. Afterward he mad=

camps with a special escort of warrant officers and devoted Jack Tars.  Dur=

march over the island an incident occurred which developed the slumbering i=

een to move off at a=20

tremendous pace at right angles with the line of march. He was seen after h=
e had run a few yards=20

to make a great jump, and then remain in his tracks. The pursuing party fou=

engaged in demolishing a moccasin, which he had crushed by jumping and land=

upon its head and back. Hogs of this particular kind are famous snake-kille=

He did not feel really intimate with her at that moment. And their marriage=
 seemed to him, in a=20

way, artificial, scarcely a fact. He did not know that it takes years to ac=
complish full intimacy=20

between husband and wife.  "You know," he said, "Henry Leek isn't my real n=
ame."  "Oh, isn't it?"=20

she said. "What does that matter?"  She was not in the least surprised to h=
ear that Henry Leek=20

was not his real name. She was a wise woman, and knew the strangeness of th=
e world. And she=20

had married him simply because he was himself, because he existed in a part=
icular manner=20

(whose charm for her she could not have described) from hour to hour.  "So =
long as you haven't=20

committed a murder or anything," she added, with her tranquil smile.  "My r=

a mistake. That=20

 see, the doctor, when he=20
