philodendron monstera there to fortify my quailing spirit. I was getting on a bit. I was curling up a little around the edges. There was no denying that fact.

in like a harpoon. And they have given me a great deal to think about. There are times, I find, 

when I can accept that intimation of slipping into the sere and yellow leaf without revolt. Then the 

next moment it fills me with a sort of desperation. I refuse to go up on the shelf. I see red and 

storm against age. I refuse to bow to the inevitable. My spirit coming down from the heights in one 

vast column, ten battalions in front and as many deep, to attack the British position in the village. 

After all, it was not by the British, but by the Austrians and Dutch, that Laffeldt was lost. We have 

no account of the battle from Wolfe's pen. But he was wounded, and it is stated, on what authority

surely decaying, and when you're decaying you're approaching the end. So stop, Father Time, 

stop, or I'll get out of the car!  But we can't get out of the car. That's the tragic part of it. We have to 

go on, whether we like it or not. We have to buck up, and grin and bear it, and make the best of a 

bad bargain. And Heaven knows I've never wanted to be one of the Glooms! I've no hankering to 

sit with the Sob Sisters and pump brine over the past. I'm light-hearted enough if they'll only give 

me a chance. I've always believed in getting what we could out of life and looking on the sunny 

side of things. And the disturbing part of it is, I don't _feel_ withered--not by a jugful! There are 

mornings when I can go about my homely old duties singing like a prairie Tetrazzini. There are 

days when I could do a hand-spring, if for nothing more than to shock my solemn old Dinky-Dunk 

out of his dourness. There are times when we go skimming along the trail with the crystal-cool 

evening air in our faces and the sun dipping down toward the rim of the world when I want to thank 

Somebody I can't see for Something-or-other I can't define. _Dum vivimus vivamus._  But it seems 

hard to realize that I'm a sedate and elderly lady already on the shady side of thirty. A woman over 

thirty years old--and I can remember the days of my intolerant youth when I regarded the woman 

of thirty as an antiquated creature who should be piously preparing herself for the next world. And 

it doesn't take thirty long to slip into forty. And then forty merges into years afterwards he said of 

his old servant, Roland: "He came to me at the hazard of his life, in the last action, with offers of 

his service, took off my cloak, and brought a fresh horse, and would have continued close by me 

had I not ordered him to retire. I believe he was slightly wounded just at that time, and the horse 

he held was shot likewise. Many a time has he pitched my tent and made the bed ready to receive 

me, half dead with fatigue, and this I owe to his diligence."  But between Dettingen and Laffeldt, 

Wolfe had been called to serve on a different scene. The Patriots, in bringing on a European war, 

had renewed the Civil War at home. Attached to the army sent against the Pretender, Wolfe (now 

major), fought under "Hangman Hawley," in the blundering and disastrous hustle at Falkirk, and, 

on a happier day, under Cumberland at Culloden. Some years afterwards he revisited the field of 

Culloden, and he has recorded his opinion that there also "somebody blundered," though he 

refrains from saying who. The mass of the rebel army, he seems to think, ought not to have been 

allowed to escape. These campaigns were a military curiosity. The Roman order of battle, 

evidently intended to repair a broken front, was perhaps a lesson taught the Roman tacticians on 

the day when their front was broken by the rush of the Celtic clans at Allia. That rush produced the 

same effect on troops unaccustomed to it and unprepared for it at Killiecrankie, and again at 

Preston Pans and Falkirk. At Culloden the Duke of Cumberland formed so as

there you are, a nice old lady with nervous indigestion and knitting-needles and a tendency to 

breathe audibly after ascending the front-stairs. No wonder, last night, it drove me to taking a 

volume of George Moore down from the shelf and reading his chapter on "The Woman of Thirty." 

But I found small consolation in that over-uxorious essay, feeling as I did that I knew life quite as 

well as any amorous studio-rat who ever made copy out of his mottled past. So I was driven, in the 

end, to studying myself long and intently in the broken-hinged mirrors of my rush came, but few of 

the Highlanders got beyond the second line. Killiecrankie and Preston Pans tell us nothing against 

Discipline.  There is an apocryphal anecdote of the Duke's cruelty and of Wolfe's humanity 

towards the wounded after the battle,--"Wolfe, shoot me that Highland scoundrel who thus dares 

to look on us with such contempt and insolence." "My commission is at your Royal Highness's 

disposal, but I never can consent to become an executioner." The anecdotist adds that from that 

day Wolfe declined in the favour and confidence of the
