Hastily locking the door, I peered out of the window. Certainly wild Indians could hardly have 

looked more savage than did those Italians, hurling stones and clubs at the house.  Yet through it 

all I had a suspicion that the demonstration was directed at Blackamoor rather than against us; for 

I fancied that I had heard our bird say _"Haw!"_ a moment before the hubbub burst forth. Still it 

was decidedly alarming while it lasted, and continued for a much longer time than was pleasant. I 

judged it more prudent to keep the door locked than to go forth to remonstrate.  Finally, after a 

great bombardment, the outcries and racket subsided, and with a vast sense of relief, I saw the 

Italians retiring across the pasture to their camp. As a matter of course the children carried home 

terrible accounts of what had occurred, and our small community waxed indignant over what was 

deemed an outrage by lawless foreigners.  The suspicion, however, remained with  "Only I hope 

there won't be any more of them!" she added dryly.  Ah! That was the point! He conceived the 

possibility of the rascal Leek having committed scores and scores of sins, all of which might come 

up against him. His affrighted vision saw whole regions populated by disconsolate widows of 

Henry Leek and their offspring, ecclesiastical and otherwise. He knew what Leek had been. 

Westminster Abbey was a strange goal for Leek to have achieved.         *       *       *       *       * 

CHAPTER IX   _A Glossy Male_   The machine was one of those electric contrivances that do 

their work noiselessly and efficiently, like a garrotter or the guillotine. No odour, no teeth-disturbing 

grind of rack-and-pinion, no trumpeting, with that machine! It arrived before the gate with such 

absence of sound that Alice, though she was dusting in the front-room, did not hear it. She heard 

nothing till the bell discreetly tinkled. Justifiably assuming that

bottom of all the trouble. I had the boys catch him and make him fast again, this time with a small 

dog-chain, which he could not bite off. He cawed vigorously, but we kept him at anchor for a week 

or more. And meanwhile the Italian camp was moved to a point six miles farther along the line of 

the new railway.  At a schoolhouse in the country it is often difficult to get small repairs made. 

Early that season the boys had broken a pane of glass in the low attic window at the front end of 

the house. I had been trying to get it replaced for two months; and now we had two panes broken. 

At last I bought new glass and a bit of putty and with the aid of Wiggan and apron on, and even 

with the duster in her hand. A handsome, smooth man stood on the step, and the electric carriage 

made a background for him. He was a dark man, with curly black hair, and a moustache to match, 

and black eyes. His silk hat, of an incredible smooth newness, glittered over his glittering hair and 

eyes. His overcoat was lined with astrakan, and this important fact was casually betrayed at the 

lapels and at the sleeves. He wore a black silk necktie, with a small pearl pin in the mathematical 

centre of the perfect rhomboid of the upper part of a sailor's knot. His gloves were of slate colour. 

The chief characteristic of his faintly striped trousers was

school.  But while setting the attic pane we made a singular discovery. In the low, dark loft, just 

inside the hole of the broken pane, lay a heap of queer things which caused us first to stare, then 

to laugh. The like, I am sure, was never found in the loft of a New England sehoolhouse before. I 

made a list. There were:    The much soiled photograph of an Italian baby.   Three photographs of 

pretty Italian girls.   Four very villainous old pipes.   Many straws of macaroni.   An old felt hat.   A 

dirty stick of candy.   Five small silver coins.   An harmonica.   An odd sort of flute.   The bonnet of 

an Italian baby.   Four soiled red bandannas.   A black wallet containing about a dollar in silver. 

Two tin cups.   Two pictures of peasants.   Two plugs of tobacco.  These are but samples. All told, 

there were at; least ninety articles. It was Blackamoor's hoard; and all the while we were 

overhauling it he cawed and hawed in great glee!  That night we talked it over, and decided that 

restoration was our only proper course. The long-suffering Italians were now six miles away; but 

on Saturday we procured a pair of farm horses and a wagon with three seats for our journey of 

reparation. The purloined articles were put in a large basket, and we set up a perch in the wagon, 

to which Blackamoor was chained in token of punishment. After this manner six of us drove to the 

new camp.  When we arrived the gang was hard at work in a cutting; but when, one after another, 

they caught sight of our wagon, with Blackamoor mortal. His boots were of _glace_ kid and as 

smooth as his cheeks. The cheeks had a fresh boyish colour, and between them, over admirable 

snowy teeth, projected the hooked key to this temperament. It _is_ possible that Alice, from sheer 

thoughtlessness, shared the vulgar prejudice against Jews; but certainly she did not now feel it. 

The man's personal charm, his exceeding niceness, had always conquered that prejudice, 

whenever encountered. Moreover, he was only about thirty-five in years, and no such costly and 

beautiful male had ever yet stood on Alice's doorstep.  She at once, in her mind, contrasted him 

with the curates of the previous week, to the disadvantage of the Established Church. She did not 

know that this man was more dangerous than a thousand curates.  "Is this Mr. Leek's?" he 

inquired smilingly, and raised his hat.  "Yes," said Alice with a responsive smile.  "Is he in?" 

"Well," said Alice, "he's busy at his work. You see in this weather he can't go out much--not to 

work--and so he--"  "Could I see him in his studio?" asked the glossy man, with the air of saying, 

"Can you grant me this supreme favour?"  It was the first time that Alice had heard the attic called 

a studio. She paused.  "It's about pictures," explained the visitor.  "Oh!" said Alice. "Will you come 

in?"  "I've run down specially to see Mr. Leek," said the visitor with emphasis.  Alice's opinion as to 

the seriousness of her husband's gift for painting had of course changed in two years. A man who 

can make two or three

atop, exclamations, not of a complimentary nature, burst forth all along the line.  But I beckoned to 

their Irish "boss," and after showing him our basket and explaining the circumstances, asked him 

to allow each of the men to take what belonged to him.  "Ah, sure!" replied the foreman, with a 

broad grin. "Here, all of you," he shouted down the cutting, "come get your trinkets what the crow 

stole!"  Wonderingly, the gang gathered round the wagon. But when they saw the basket and what 

was in it, by producing alleged pictures that in Alice's secret view bore only a comic resemblance 

to anything at all--that man had to be taken seriously in his attic as an artisan. It is true that Alice 

thought the payment he received miraculously high for the quality of work done; but, with this 

agreeable Jew in the hall, and the _coupe_ at the kerb, she suddenly perceived the probability of 

even greater miracles in the matter of price. She saw the average price of ten pounds rising to 

fifteen, or even

satisfaction arose. Each seized his own.  I had the foreman say to them how very sorry we were 

that our bad bird had given them so much trouble. Then followed, in response, as pretty a bit of 

politeness as I have ever witnessed.  The Italians took off their hats and bowed all round. One of 

them then made a little speech, which the Irish boss translated after ruin the affair by his absurd, 

retiring shyness.  "Will you come this way?" she suggested briskly.  And all that elegance followed 

her up to the attic door: which door she threw open, remarking simply--  "Henry, here is a 

gentleman come to see you about pictures."   _A Connoisseur_   Priam recovered more quickly 

than might have been expected. His first thought
