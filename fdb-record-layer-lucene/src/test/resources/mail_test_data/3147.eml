   The spying Wireless sows the night with troops       of stealthy ghosts,=
    While hushed through all her huddled streets the       tide-walled _
leather boots and a close fitting corduroy riding hat. Her father had not b=
een so obdurate that he=20

had not sent Charlotta a large trunk of her clothes soon after he learned o=
f her safe arrival in=20

Coblenz.  "You mean to say as kindly as possible that you think I am a cowa=
rd," she returned=20

finally. "That is what Mrs. Clark thinks also, only she has not said so, I =
suppose because I have=20

never asked her. Sometimes, I have wondered since my arrival in Coblenz, if=
 I should go back=20

home and ask my father's forgiveness, making him understand that I shall ne=
ver marry any one for=20

whom I do not care. But my problem is, would he accept an apology which did=
 not include=20

obedience? You see that is what my new American friends cannot understand i=
n my father's and=20

my attitude to each other. Besides, I do so want to go to the United States=
 when Mrs. Clark and=20

Bianca and several of her Red Cross nurses return home. Mrs. Clark tells me=
 that she and Dr.=20

Clark only intend remaining in Coblenz until after the Germans have signed =
the treaty of peace.=20

Dr. Clark then feels that he must go back to his New York city practice and=
 be relieved by a=20

younger man. Three or four of the American Red Cross nurses will be sailing=
 at the same time.=20

You simply cannot guess how I long to travel. Think of being as restless a =
person as I am and shut=20

up in a tiny country like Luxemburg! I have never been anywhere else except=
 just into Germany in=20

all my life."  "Hard luck of course, and you would enjoy the United States!=
 You are just the kind of=20

girl to appreciate it. You must do what you think is right yourself since a=
fter all another fellow's=20

judgment is not worth much," Major Hersey replied, not altogether pleased w=
ith the idea of his new=20

friends vanishing from Coblenz when his own duties might keep him there an =
indefinite time.  Later=20

that afternoon, at about dusk, on his way toward home, Major James Hersey w=
as considering a=20

number of matters somewhat seriously. He was a United States officer with n=
othing to live upon=20

save his pay. Up to the present his one desire had been to continue to serv=
e his country.  In=20

Germany at this time there was a good deal of intensely bitter feeling. Wit=
h the delay in the=20

presentation of the peace terms a less friendly attitude toward America and=
 the Americans was=20

developing than during the weeks first following the German defeat.  In the=
 interior the poorer=20

people were said to be hungry, war weary and anxious to resume their normal=
 business life.  In=20

Coblenz there was especial dissatisfaction with the present German governme=
nt, Coblenz having=20

been a centre of pan-Germanism and pro-Kaiserism.  Carefully concealed as s=
uch ideas were=20

supposed to be from the members of the American Army of Occupation, there w=
ere United States=20

officers who appreciated that there were groups of prominent Germans at thi=
s time desiring the=20

return of the Kaiser and some form of monarchial control. It was not known =
in March that the=20

Kaiser might be tried by an international court.  Quietly Major Hersey had =
been informed that the=20

United States Secret Service was endeavoring to discover the men who had be=
en the Kaiser's=20

closest friends in Coblenz before his inglorious departure into Holland.  T=
here were still, Major=20

Jimmie reflected, many interesting ways to serve one's country, even if the=
 great war were past.=20

This afternoon it struck him that this might become more of a sacrifice tha=
n he had anticipated, but=20

notwithstanding his country must always remain first!  At the threshold of =
his own door he stopped,=20

slightly puzzled. Some one was already in his sitting-room, which was unusu=
al at this hour. His=20

rooms were cleaned in the morning and he was seldom interrupted afterwards =
either by a servant=20

or any member of the household.  But probably a fellow officer had dropped =
in to see him and was=20

awaiting his return.  Suddenly, with this idea in mind, Major Hersey thrust=
 his door open.  Then he=20

stood stock still in a slightly apologetic attitude.  His room was occupied=
 and by the head of the=20



German household in which he was at present living, Colonel Liedermann.  Ma=
jor Hersey had not=20

come into contact with him but once since his own arrival in Coblenz severa=
l months before.  The=20

old German Colonel, wearing civilian clothes, was standing examining an Ame=
rican rifle, which the=20

young American army officer had carelessly left propped up against the wall=
 in one corner of his=20

room.  The older man wheeled sharply at the younger one's entrance.  Colone=
l Liedermann had=20

the typical German face, broad, with heavy, overhanging brows, small, stern=
 blue eyes, and=20

drooping jaws.  His face reddened at the present moment, but he said courte=
ously: "I owe you an=20

apology for entering your room when you were not present. I came to ask you=
 if you would do me=20

the favor of permitting me to look over some of your American newspapers. G=
ermany is not being=20

informed of all that is taking place in the world these days and I should l=
ike very much to know. But=20

it is not for myself alone that I make this request. I am an old man and ma=
y not live long enough to=20

see the new Germany if it is ever possible for Germany to arise out of the =
ashes of the past. But=20

my son, as you know, has never recovered from his last and most serious wou=
nd. To lie always in=20

bed after so active a life, grows exceedingly irksome. I find it difficult =
to keep him even fairly=20

content. It was for him I was asking the loan of your newspapers. I presume=
 the fact that we have=20

so recently been enemies will not preclude your doing me this kindness. If =
so, I regret my=20

intrusion."  A little overcome by the old German officer's haughty manner a=
nd set speech, Major=20

Jimmie only murmured that he would be very glad of course to permit his Ame=
rican newspapers to=20

be read, if Colonel Liedermann and his son did not feel that they would too=
 greatly resent the=20

American point of view.  As he made this statement, although not pleased by=
 the German officer's=20

request, Major Hersey was searching diligently for the latest bundle of Ame=
rican papers which he=20

had received.  As he handed them to the former German Colonel, the old offi=
cer said, speaking in=20

a more human fashion,  "I was interested in looking at this American rifle =
of yours. Naturally as an=20

old soldier I remain interested in firearms, although I shall not live to s=
ee another war, however=20

little I believe in a permanent world peace. Clever piece of mechanism! I a=
m told the American rifle=20

is the finest in the world!"  Not feeling called upon to reply to this spee=
ch and anxious that the old=20

officer should depart, Major Hersey made no response.  A little later, when=
 he had finally gone,=20

with an unusual expression upon his boyish countenance, Major Jimmie Hersey=
 sank down into=20

his arm chair.  Was it singular that one could not recover from the sensati=
on of acute distrust in the=20

presence of a German? Among them there must be certain individuals who were=
 truthful and=20

straightforward. Yet after a century of training that the end justified the=
 means, among German=20

army officers one could not expect to find any other standard, than the sta=
ndard which regarded=20

the treaty of Belgium as a "scrap of paper." Betray any friend, any cause, =
any country to=20

accomplish one's purpose. And tonight, although a member of Colonel Liederm=
ann's household,=20

Major Jimmie Hersey knew he would always remain   For I am fulfilled of the=
 silence, and long=20

For to utter the sense of the silence in song.    Down-stream all the rapid=
s are troubled with=20

pebbles     That fetter and fret what the water would utter,   And it rushe=
s and splashes in=20

tremulous trebles;     It makes haste through the shallows, its soul is    =
     aflutter;    But here all=20

the sound is serene and outspread     In the murmurous moods of a slow-swir=
ling pool;     Here all=20

the sounds are unhurried and cool;   Every silence is kith to a sound; they=
 are wed,   They are=20

mated, are mingled, are tangled, are         bound;   Every hush is in love=
 with a sound, every sound=20

By the law of its life to some silence is bound.    Then here will we hide;=
 idle here and abide,   In=20



the covert here, close by the waterside--   Here, where the slim flattered =
reeds are aquiver   With=20

the exquisite hints of the reticent river,     Here, where the lips of this=
 pool are the lips   Of all pools,=20

let us listen and question and wait;     Let us hark to the whispers of lov=
e and of death,   Let us=20

hark to the lispings of life and of fate--   In this place where pale silen=
ces flower into sound   Let us=20

strive for some secret of all the profound   Deep and calm Silence that mes=
hes men 'round!=20

There's as much of God hinted in one ripple's         plashes--     There's=
 as much of Truth glints in=20

yon         dragon-fly's flight--   There's as much Purpose gleams where yo=
nder         trout flashes=20

As in--any book else!--could we read things         aright.    Then nymph o=
f mine indolence, here let=20

us hide,   Learn, listen, and question; idle here and abide   Where the rus=
hes and lilies lean low to=20

dazzled with visions         and gleams,      I have spun with her dervish =

of her flashing dreams;       I have sunk with her dull despair;   I have s=

No more the thunder and the urge       Of earth's full tides that storm the=

Wars with the heart that dares and sings;--         It is not always Dawn! =
  A little while, with age and=20

death,     He wanders, dreaming.     WORDS ARE NOT GUNS    _Put by the swor=
d_ (a dreamer=20

saith),     _The years of peace draw nigh!   Already the millennial dawn   =
  Makes red the eastern=20

sky!_    Be not deceived.  It comes not yet!     The ancient passions keep =
  Alive beneath their=20

changing masks.     They are not dead.  They=20


_
courtesy he might be treated.  It was an actual fact that never since his c=
asual conversation with=20

little Gretchen, the baby of the family, had he the same sense of untrouble=
d serenity in the midst of=20

this German military home.  Was it true that Captain Ludwig Liedermann was =
still unable to move=20

from his bed? If so why had little Gretchen told so ingenious a falsehood? =
One would scarcely=20

expect a little girl of six to make up so useless a story. But if Captain L=
iedermann were well why=20

should he continue to make a pretence of illness? There were no penalties a=
ttached to the fact=20

that he had been a German officer. Could it be possible that he so intensel=
y disliked the idea of=20

coming into contact with the troops General Pershing had led to victory, th=
at he preferred=20

invalidism to this other form of martyrdom?  There was just one point upon =
which Major Jimmie=20

Hersey was able to make up his mind during this one evening's meditation.  =
   Surely peace=20

comes.  As sure as Man     Rose from primeval slime.   That was not yesterd=
ay.  There's still     A=20

weary height to climb!    And we can dwell too long with dreams     And pla=
y too much with words,=20

Forgetting our inheritance     Was bought and held with swords.    _But Tru=
th_ (you say) _makes=20

tyrants quail--     Beats down embattled Wrong?_   If truth be armed!  Be n=
ot deceived.     The=20

strife is to the strong.    Words are not guns.  Words are not ships.     A=
nd ships and guns prevail.=20

Our liberties, that blood has gained,     Are guarded, or they fail.    Tru=
th does not triumph without=20

blows,     Error not tamely yields.   But falsehood closes with quick faith=
,     Fierce, on a thousand=20

fields.    And surely, somewhat of that faith     Our fathers fought for cl=
ings!   Which called this=20

freedom's hemisphere,     Despite Earth's leagued kings.    Great creeds gr=
ow thews, or else they=20

die.     Thought clothed in=20


_
Liedermann home. He had been surprised to find her returning not once but s=
everal times of late.=20

She must understand that the Red Cross nurses were not supposed to make fri=
ends with the=20

families of Germans until after peace was declared.  The little Freia had n=
ot been seriously hurt,=20

having entirely recovered from her fright and injury by the next day. Never=
theless, Miss Jamison=20

had made not one, but four or five other calls since her introduction to Fr=
au Liedermann.  Of=20

course, as he knew Miss Jamison but slightly, advice from him might prove  =
 What are thy gods?=20

Thy gods brought love?     They also brought a sword.    Unchallenged, shal=
l we always stand,=20

Secure, apart, aloof?   Be not deceived.  That hour shall come     Which pu=
ts us to the proof.=20

Then, that we hold the trust we have     Safeguarded for our sons,   Let us=
 cease dreaming!  Let us=20

have     More ships, more troops, more guns!     WITH THE SUBMARINES    ABO=
