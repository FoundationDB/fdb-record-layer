ospital and we saw doctors and nurses dodging in and out of the innumerable=
 corridors, and smelled iodoform everywhere. A major domo, in scarlet, who =

mediaevalism, fish has led to the invention of the same means of preserving=

training his son to run for president. The high caste Romans have an Austri=
an pride, that "goeth=20

before destruction." For politically their power is sadly on the wane. They=
 are miserably moth-

eaten compared to our own arrogant princes of Wall Street or even compared =
to the dazed dukes=20

and earls of England, who are looking out at the wreck of matter and the cr=

them. One feels vaguely that these Italian nobles are passing through a rat=

decay. For a time during the latter part of the last century and during the=
 first decade of this=20

century, the Italian noblemen tried to edge into business. They lent their =
names to promotion=20

schemes, and the schemes, upon the whole, turned out badly, and the people =
learned to distrust=20

all financial schemes under noble patronage; so the nobility is going to wo=
rk. A few strong families=20

remain--the present royal house of Savoy is among the strong ones.  Our bus=
iness led us to a call=20

on the Duke of Genoa, uncle to the King, who in the King's absence at the f=
ront with his soldiers,=20

was a sort of acting king on the job in Rome. The automobile the forests of=
 the Orinoco garments=20

the spectators, the women, who were excluded from the dance, and every sort=

were daily occupied in serving the men with roasted monkey, fermented liquo=

cabbage. This last production has the taste of our cauliflowers, and in no =
other country had we=20

seen specimens of such an immense size. The leaves that are not unfolded ar=

 them in the sun, and=20

reduce them to powder without separating the bones. I have seen masses of f=

of this flour, which resembles that of cassava. When it is wanted for eatin=
