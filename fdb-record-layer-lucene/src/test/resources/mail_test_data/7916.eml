he be engulfed in eyes? Such a woman needs no future punishment. She has al=
l she deserves in this world. My punishment had begun, and it would always =
go on through my life with Raoul, I knew, even if no great disaster came. I=
nto the heart of my happiness would come the thought of that hidden spot; h=
ow often, _
amongst the boys, for at their very last meeting he had given them a lectur=
e upon punctuality.=20

"So, my lads, you think that you have caught me napping for once," cried Ne=
d Franks, in his=20

cheerful tone; "but I'll not be hard on any one who is a minute and three-q=
uarters beyond time,"=20

Franks glanced at the large clock on the wall, "if he brings as good an exc=
use for delay as I do=20

now. Here," he cried, waving his bank-note triumphantly, "here are five pou=
nds given to the=20

collection for Wild Rose Hollow, by our friend, Bat Bell, the miller."  A d=
eafening shout arose from=20

the boys. The miller had so long been regarded as a money-making, money-sav=
ing screw, that=20

they cheered him at the top of their voices in his new character of a money=
-giving man.  "I can=20

match your piece of good news with another," said Persis Franks, who had co=
me into the school-

room on purpose to tell her tidings to her husband. "Mr. Leyton called whil=
e you were out, to let us=20

know that his aunt had this morning received a letter from Mrs. Lane, enclo=
sing for the same=20

purpose a check for ten pounds."  There was a cheer for Mrs. Lane, but not =
quite so uproarious,=20

because the announcement excited less surprise.  "I'll top your story," sai=
d the smiling sailor,=20

speaking so that all the boys might hear. "Ben Stone, the carpenter, has ki=
ndly promised to give=20

five pounds' worth of his labor to repair the tumble-down almshouses in Wil=
d Rose Hollow."  A=20

very loud hurrah followed this announcement, mingled with clapping of hands=
. The young curate,=20

who chanced to be passing the school at that time, paused in some surprise =
on hearing such a=20

shout, and thought that the naval school-master must have a novel and curio=
us way of educating=20

his pupils. But Ned Franks was teaching his boys a lesson quite as importan=
t as even the=20

multiplication-table.  "Now you see, my lads," said the sailor, raising his=
 hands to enforce attention,=20

"that he who cannot give much money to a charity, may give his own honest h=
ard work. Now, I've=20

lately read in a capital book[A] of school-boys, who, when shown how to go =
about it, actually built=20

a house for themselves, that the purses of generous friends might be spared=
 as much as possible.=20

Now, I think that there's no one here present, but myself, that has not two=
 hands, and on those=20

hands ten fingers and thumbs. If any one here present wants to help to set =
the almshouses to=20

rights, and is willing to give an odd hour of labor every week-day till the=
 job is done, let him now=20

hold up his right hand."  Instantly, above the dark cluster of boys, a numb=
er of hands--white, red,=20

clean, and soiled--were held up.  "Or," continued Franks, "as the days are =
now long, if there be=20

any one who could and would give two hours daily to serving God, by thus he=
lping his poor, let=20

that one now hold up both hands."  Up went all the left hands, to the sound=
 of a cheer louder and=20

more joyous than the first; and then all the hands were employed in clappin=
g, as if, instead of an=20

invitation to labor, the boys had received an invitation to a feast.[B]  "B=
lessings on the noble-

hearted little fellows!" thought the school-master, as he looked down on th=
at mass of bright young=20

faces. And Persis, as she fixed her proud eyes on her husband, thought, "Ne=
d can lead these=20

boys wherever he will; for he never asks them to do a brave, or kind, or ge=
nerous thing, without=20

first showing them how to do it by his example!"  [A] Liefde's "Six Months =
amongst the Charities of=20

Europe."  [B] I wish that the united energies of the children of every scho=
ol in Britain, whether for=20

the rich or the poor, could thus be enlisted in some good work. Masters and=
 mistresses would find=20

the beneficial effect in the minds of their pupils. Even Ragged Schools mig=
ht have a collecting box=20

for farthings; or children's sympathies might be enlisted in behalf of some=
 charity near them.=20

Working _together_ for God promotes union, and it is a blessed thing for th=
e young to learn to=20

delight in such work.     IX.  The Invitation.   "Was it a shame in me, my =
darling, to bring you into=20



this engagement about Nancy Sands?" asked Ned at a later hour of the day, w=
hen, seated at a=20

comfortable meal, he something that felt like it, where my heart ought to h=
ave been.  Now was=20

Lord Robert's time to propose--now, when she believed me faithless and unwo=
rthy--if he but knew=20

it. And I was afraid that he would know it.  I got out into the open air, f=
eeling half-dazed as one of=20

the under porters called me a cab. I gave the name of a street in the direc=
tion, but at some=20

distance from Maxine's, lest ears should hear which ought not to hear: and =
it was only when we=20

were well away from the hotel that I amended my first instructions. Even th=
en, I mentioned the=20

street leading into the one where I was due, not the street itself.  "_Depe=
chez vous_" I added, for I=20

had delayed eight or ten minutes longer than I ought, and this had upset th=
e exactness of my=20

calculations. The man obeyed; nevertheless, instead of reaching the top of =
Maxine's street at two=20

or three minutes before twelve, as I had intended, it was nearly ten minute=
s past when I got out of=20

my cab at the corner: and when I came to the gate of the house a clock some=
where was striking=20

the quarter hour after midnight.     MAXINE DE RENZIE'S PART    CHAPTER VII=
I   MAXINE=20

ACTS ON THE STAGE AND OFF  How I got through the play on that awful night, =
I don't know.=20

When I went onto the stage to take up my cue, soon after the beginning of t=
he first act, my brain=20

was a blank. I could not remember a single line that I had to say. I couldn=
't even see through the=20

dazzling mist which floated before my eyes, to recognise Raoul in the box w=
here I knew he would=20

be sitting unless--something had happened. But presently I was conscious of=
 one pair of hands=20

clapping more than all the rest. Yes, Raoul was there. I felt his love reac=
hing out to me and=20

warming my chilled heart like a ray of sunshine that finds its way through =
shadows. I must not fail.=20

For his sake, I must not fail. I never had failed, and I would not now--abo=
ve all, not now.  It was the=20

thought of Raoul that gave me back my courage; and though I couldn't have s=
aid one word of my=20

part before I came on the stage to answer that first cue, by the time the a=
pplause had died down=20

enough to let me speak, each line seemed to spring into my mind as it was n=
eeded. Then I got out=20

of myself and into the part, as I always do, but had feared not to do to-ni=
ght. The audience was=20

mine, to play with as I liked, to make laugh, to make cry, and clap its han=
ds or shout "Brava-

brava!"  Yet for once I feared it, feared that great crowd of people out th=
ere, as a lion tamer must=20

at some time or other fear one of his lions. "What if they know all I've do=
ne?" The question flashed=20

across my brain. "What if a voice in the auditorium should suddenly shout t=
hat Maxine de Renzie=20

had betrayed France for money, English money?" How these hands which applau=
ded would tingle=20

to seize me by the throat and choke my life out.  Still, with these thought=
s murmuring in my head=20

like a kind of dreadful undertone, I went on. An actress can always go on--=
till she breaks. I think=20

that she can't be bent, as other women can: and I envy the women who haven'=
t had to learn the=20

lesson of hardening themselves. It seems to me that they must suffer less. =
 At last came the end=20

of the first act. But there were five curtain calls. Five times I had to go=
 back and smile, and bow,=20

and look delighted with the ovation I was having. Then, when the time came =
that I could escape, I=20

met on the way to my dressing-room men carrying big harps and crowns, baske=
ts and bunches of=20

flowers which had been sent up to me on the stage. I pushed past, hardly gl=
ancing at them, for I=20

knew that Raoul would be waiting.  There he was, radiant with his unselfish=
 pride in me--my big,=20

handsome lover, looking more like the Apollo Belvedere come alive and dress=
ed in modern=20

clothes than like an ordinary diplomatic young man from the Foreign Office.=
 But then, of course, he=20

is really quite out of place in diplomacy. Since he can't exist on a marble=
 pedestal or some Old=20



Master's canvas, he ought at least to be a poet or an artist--and so he is =
at heart; not one, but=20

both; and a dreamer of beautiful dreams, as beautiful and noble as his own =
clear-cut face, which=20

might be cold if it were not for the eyes,=20


_
with a vigor which amused his wife, who did not know of his having given aw=
ay his sandwich to the=20

wayfaring man.  "Nay, I think that it would have been a shame had we refuse=
d to do what we=20

could for poor Mr. Sands in his trouble. Besides there is nothing very form=
idable in paying a=20

morning visit to Nancy," added Persis, with a smile; "she has always been r=
ather civil to me. I=20

remember that when I lived in the dell, before my marriage, when my poor ol=
d grandfather was ill,=20

Nancy once brought me some broth of her own making, to keep up his strength=
, as she said."=20

"Perhaps what her husband  There were people about, and we spoke like mere =
acquaintances=20

until I'd led Raoul into the little boudoir which adjoins my dressing-room.=
 Then--well, we spoke no=20

longer like mere acquaintances. That is enough to say. And we had five minu=
tes together, before I=20

was obliged to send him away, and go to dress for the second act.  The touc=
h of Raoul's hands,=20

and those lips of his that are not cold, gave me strength to go through all=
 that was yet to come.=20

There's something almost magical in the touch--just a little, little touch-=
-of the one we love best.=20

For a moment we can forget everything=20


_
her after all, though I own that I don't like the ring of it. He ought to k=
now her best; but I'm not very=20

hopeful about Nancy Sands," said Franks, pushing back his empty plate; "you=
 see, wifie, when=20

once a _woman_ takes to the glass, they say that there's not a chance of he=
r ever getting rid of=20

the habit."  "I never like to hear that said," observed Persis. "Why should=
 a woman, any more than=20

a man, be beyond reach of God's mercy and grace? A woman has often strong, =
deep affections,=20

and especially shrinks from dragging down her family to misery and ruin."  =
"But when she is once=20

right in the middle of the whirlpool, can she help being sucked in?" said t=
he sailor, gravely.=20

"Intemperance is like a whirlpool, wifie. Round about it, at some distance =
from the centre, it looks=20

not much more than a ripple of the sea; the careless pilot might venture up=
on it, and, unless he=20

keep a sharp lookout at his bearings, scarcely guesses what a if it were de=
ath itself waiting just=20

round the corner. I've flirted with more than one man, sometimes because I =
liked him and it=20

amused me,--as with Ivor Dundas,--sometimes because I had to win him for po=
litic reasons. But I=20

never knew that blessed feeling until I met Raoul du Laurier. It was a heav=
enly rest now to lay my=20

head for a minute on his shoulder, just shutting my eyes, without speaking =
a word.  I thought--for I=20

was worn out, body and soul, with the strain of keeping up and hiding my se=
cret--that when I was=20

dead the best paradise would be to lean so on Raoul's shoulder, never movin=
g, for the first two or=20

three hundred years of eternity. But as the peaceful fancy cooled my brain,=
 back darted=20

remembrance, like a poisonous snake. I reminded myself how little I deserve=
d such a paradise,=20

and how my lover's dear arms would put me away, in a kind of unbelieving ho=
rror, if he knew what=20

I had done, and how I had betrayed his=20


_
closer and closer, to the down-whirl of waters. Let him sheer off at once, =
and he is safe; if he=20

slacken sail, and let the vessel drift, why, he's lost,--he comes to a poin=
t where he _can't_ get her=20

off, let him strain every muscle as he may. And it's just so with the drink=
ing. A man feels sick, or a=20

woman feels sad; a drop of something will warm and cheer them, they think; =
and I don't say but=20

that it may often do so, and that spirits may be used as medicine, and be f=
ound a good gift of God.=20

But when the 'drop' comes to be taken pretty often; when there is less of w=
ater and more  For ten=20

years I'd been a political spy--yes. But I owed a grudge to Russia, which I=
'd promised my father to=20

pay: and France is Russia's ally. Besides, it seems less vile to betray a c=
ountry than to deceive a=20

man you adore, who adores you in return. We women are true as truth itself =
to those we love. For=20

them we would sacrifice the greatest cause. Always I had known this, and I =
had thought that I=20

could prove myself truer than the truest, if I ever loved. Yet now I had be=
trayed my lover and sold=20

his country; and, realising what I had done, as I hardly had realised it ti=
ll this=20


_
man (or woman) begins to relish the glass, and think that he can't do witho=
ut it,--then's the time to=20

sheer off! Don't let him wait till the habit begins to draw him in as with =
the grasp of a giant, till he=20

finds that the ship won't answer the helm, that  Even if, by something like=
 a miracle, we were=20

saved from ruin, nothing on earth could wash the stain from my heart, which=

edge that to hold a=20
