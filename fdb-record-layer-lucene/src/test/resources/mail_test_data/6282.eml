but they could see nothing, of course, and the night seemed very silent. As for Long Gun, he could 

not be induced to come outside the tent.  The boys passed rather an uneasy night, but fatigue 

finally made them sleep, in spite of their alarm, and they slumbered so soundly toward morning 

that no one awoke to replenish the camp fire, which went out.  "Well, we're all here and alive, at 

any rate," remarked Jack as he looked around on coming out of the tent for a wash.  "Snapping 

sand-bars! but it's cold!" cried Nat, rubbing his benumbed fingers and threshing his arms about. 

"Hi! Long Gun, are you so afraid of the mysterious noise that you can't build a fire?"  "Hu!" grunted 

the Indian as he came from the tent, but he speedily had a genial blaze going, and breakfast in 

preparation.  "Well, now for some more hunting," said Jack when the camp had been put in order. 

"Nat and I want to get that ram we missed yesterday."  "And I want to land a big buck mule deer 

that I think I hit, but not hard enough," said Sam.  They started off, and were gone all day, 

sometimes hunting together, and, again, separating for a few miles. But they had no luck, though 

Jack got an opportunity for a couple of fine shots, missing both of them. However, they did not 

much mind, as they had plenty of food in camp.  A day or so later, however, when Jack and Sam 

were out together, Jack got the very chance he wanted. They were walking along a rocky ridge, 

and, coming to the edge of a deep ravine, were debating whether to great surprise he was the 

valedictorian of the class, and he carried everything before him. He won a prize, and when it was 

given to him, he stepped down before the whole audience, and kissed his mother, and said: 

"Here, mother, here is the prize. It is yours. I would not have had it if it had not been for you." 

Thank God for such a man!  The one glimpse the Bible gives us of thirty out of the thirty-three 

years of Christ's life on earth shows that He did not come to destroy this fifth commandment. The 

secret of all those silent years is embodied in that verse in Luke's Gospel--"And He went down 

with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them." Did He not set an example of true filial 

love and care when in the midst of the agonies of the cross He mode provision for His mother? Did 

He not condemn the miserable evasions of this law by the Pharisees of His own day:  "Well did 

Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoreth me with their lips, but their 

heart is far from me. But in vain do they worship me, teaching as their doctrines the precepts of 

men. . . . Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition. For 

Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let 

him die the death; but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou 

mightest have been profited by me, is Corban, (that is to say, Given to God), ye no longer suffer 

him to do aught for his

it or travel back, as they had seen no signs of game, and it looked as if a storm was brewing.  "I 

guess we'll go back," Sam remarked. "There doesn't seem to be any----"  He looked around to see 

what Jack was doing, and beheld his chum down on one knee, aiming at something on a distant 

rock. Sam looked and saw, outlined in the clear light, a big ram. He did not speak, fearing to 

disconcert Jack's aim, and the next instant the rifle of his chum cracked.  The ram gave a your 

tradition, which ye have delivered."  I have read of one heathen custom in China, which would do 

us credit in this so-called Christian country. On every New Year's morning each man and boy, 

from the emperor to the lowest peasant, is said to pay a visit to his mother, carrying her a present 

varying in value according to his station in life. He thanks her for all she has done for him, and 

asks a continuance of her favor another year. Abraham Lincoln used to say: "All I have
