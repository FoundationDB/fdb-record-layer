And what is more, he was au mad. He jabbed the bell must be considered as the effect of geographical situation, and the conflicting interests thence resulting.

us. We teased her more or less about a young doctor of the Johns Hopkins unit who sometimes 

hovered over her deck chair and a certain Gilded Youth--every boat-load has its Gilded Youth--

whose father was president of so many industrial concerns, and the vice-president of so many 

banks and trust companies that it was hard to look at the boy without blinking at his gilding. Henry 

was betting on the Gilded Youth; so the young doctor fell to me. For the first three or four days 

during which we kept fairly close tab on their time, the Doctor had the Gilded Youth beaten two 

hours to one. Henry bought enough lemonade for me and smoking room swill of one sort and 

another to start his little old Wichita ocean But it was plain that the Gilded Youth interested her. 

And in a confidential moment filled with laughter and chaff and chatter she told us why: "He's 

patronizing me. I mean he doesn't know it, and he thinks I don't know it; but that's what he's doing. 

I interest him as a social specimen. I mean--I'm a bug and he likes to take me up and examine me. 

I think I'm the first 'Co-ed' he ever has seen; the first girl who voted and didn't let her skirts sag and 

still loved good candy! I mean that when he found in one half hour that I knew he wore nine dollar 

neckties and that I was for Roosevelt, the man nearly expired; he was that puzzled! I'm not quite 

the type of working girl whom Heaven protects and he chases, but--I mean I think he is wondering 

just how far Heaven really will protect my kind! When he decides," she confided in a final burst of 

laughter, and tucking away her overflowing red hair, "I may have to slap him--I mean don't you 

know--"  And we did know. And being in his late forties Henry began tantalizing me with odds on 

the Gilded Youth. He certainly was a beautiful boy--tall, chestnut haired, clean cut, and altogether 

charming. He played Brahms and Irving Berlin with equal grace on the piano in the women's 

lounge on the ship and an amazing game of stud poker with the San Francisco boys in the 

smoking room. And it was clear that he regarded the Eager Soul as a social adventure somewhat 

higher than his mother's social secretary--but of the same class. He was returning from a furlough, 

to drive his ambulance in France, and the Doctor was going out to join his unit somewhere in 

France down near the Joan of Arc country. He told us shyly one day, as we watched the wake of 

the ship together, that he was to be stationed at an old chateau upon whose front is carved in 

stone, "I serve because I am served!" When he did not repeat the motto we knew that it had 

caught him. He had been at home working on a germ problem connected with army life, hardly to 

be mentioned in the presence of Mrs. Boffin, and he was forever casually discussing his difficulties 

with the Eager Soul; and a stenographer, who came upon the two at their tete-a-tete one day, ran 

to the girls in the lounge and gasped, "My Lord, Net, if you'd a heard it, you'd a jumped off the 

boat!"  [Illustration with caption: She often paced the rounds of the deck between us]  As the 

passenger list began to resolve itself into familiar faces and figures and friends we became 

gradually aware of a pair of eyes--a pair of snappy black, female, French eyes. Speaking broadly 

and allowing for certain Emporia and Wichita exceptions, eyes were no treat to us. Yet we fell to 

talking blithely of those eyes. Henry said if he had to douse his cigar on deck at night, the captain 

should make the Princess wear dimmers at night or stay indoors. We were not always sure she 

was a Princess. At times she seemed more like a Duchess or a Countess, according to her 

clothes. We never had seen such clothes! And millinery! We were used to Broadway; Michigan 

Avenue did not make us shy, and Henry had been in the South. But these clothes and the hats 

and the eyes--all full dress--were too many for us. And we fell to speculating upon exactly what 

would happen on Main Street and Commercial Street in Wichita and Emporia if the Duchess could 



sail down there in full regalia. Henry's place at table was where he got the full voltage of the eyes 

every time the Princess switched them on. And whenever he reached for the water and gulped it 

down, one could know he had been jolted behind his ordinary resisting power. And he drank 

enough to float a ship! As we wended our weary way over the decks during the long lonely hours 

of the voyage, we fell to theorizing about those eyes and we concluded that they were Latin--Latin 

chiefly engaged in the business of being female eyes. It was a new show to us. Our wives and 

mothers had voted at city elections for over thirty years and had been engaged for a generation in 

the business of taming their husbands; saving the meat from dinner for the hash for breakfast, and 

betimes for diversion, working in their clubs for the good of their towns; and their eyes had visions 

in them, not sex. So these female eyes showed us a mystery! And each of us in his heart decided 

to investigate the phenomena. And on the seventh day we laid off from our work and called it 

good. We had met the Princess. Our closer view persuaded us that she might be thirty-five but 

probably was forty, though one early morning in a passage way we met her when she looked fifty, 

wan and sad and weary, but still flashing her eyes. And then one fair day, she turned her eyes 

from us for ever. This is what happened to me. But Henry himself may have been the hero of the 

episode. Anyway, one of us was walking the deck with the Countess investigating the kilowat 

power of the eyes. He was talking of trivial things, possibly telling the lady fair of the new ten-story 

Beacon Building or of Henry Ganse's golf score on the Emporia Country Club links--anyway 

something of broad, universal human interest. But those things seemed to pall on her. So he tried 

her on the narrow interests that engage the women at home--the suffrage question; the matter of 

the eight-hour day and the minimum wage for women; and national prohibition. These things left 

her with no temperature. She was cold; she even shivered, slightly, but grace fully withal, as she 

went swinging along on her toes, her silk sweater clinging like an outer skin to her slim lithe body, 

walking like a girl of sixteen. And constantly she was at target practice with her eyes with all her 

might and main. She managed to steer the conversation to a place where she could bemoan the 

cruel war; and ask what the poor women would do. Her Kansas partner suggested that life would 

be broader and better for women after the war, because they would have so much more important 

a part to do than before in the useful work of the world. "Ah, yes," she said, "perhaps so. But with 

the men all gone what shall we do when we want to be petted?" She made two sweet unaccented 

syllables of petted in her ingenue French accent and added: "For you know women were made to 

be pet-ted." There was a bewildered second under the machine gun fire of the eyes when her 

companion considered seriously her theory. He had never cherished such a theory before. But he 

was seeing a new world, and this seemed to be one of the pleasant new things in it--this theory of 

the woman requiring to be pet-ted!  Then the French Colonel hove in sight and she said: "Oh, yes-

-come on, Col-o-nel"--making three unaccented syllables of the word--"and we shall have une 

femme sandweech." She gave the Colonel her arm. The miserable Kansan had not thought to 

take it, being busy with the Beacon Building or the water hazard at the Emporia Country Club, and 

then, as the Col-o-nel took her arm she lifted the Eyes to the stupid clod of a Kansan and switched 

on all the joyous incandescence of her lamps as she said, addressing the Frenchman but gazing 

sweetly at the American, "Col-o-nel, will you please carry my books?" They must have weighed six 

or eight ounces! And she shifted them to the Col-o-nel as though they weighed a ton!  So the 

Kansan walked wearily to the smoking room to find his mate. They two then and there discussed 



the woman proposition in detail and drew up strong resolutions of respect for the Wichita and 

Emporia type, the American type that carries its own books and burdens and does not require of 

its men a silly and superficial chivalry and does not stimulate it by the everlasting lure of sex! Men 

may die for the Princess and her kind and enjoy death. We were willing that they should. We 

evinced no desire to impose our kultur on others. But after that day on the deck the Princess lost 

her lure for Henry and me! So we went to the front stoop of the boat and watched the Armenians 

drill. A great company of them was crowded in the steerage and all day long, with a sergeant 

major, they went through the drill. They were returning to Europe to fight with the French army and 

avenge the wrongs of their people. When they tired of drilling, they danced, and when they tired of 

dancing, they sang. It was queer music for civilized ears, the Armenian songs they sang. It was 

written on a barbaric scale with savage cadences and broken time; but it was none the less sweet 

for being weird. It had the charm and freedom of the desert in it, and was as foreign as the strange 

brown faces that lifted toward us as they sang.  "What is that music?" asked the Kansans of a New 

England boy in khaki who had been playing Greig that day for them on the piano. "That," nodded 

the youth toward the Armenians. "Oh, that--why that's the 'Old Oaken Bucket!'" His face did not 

relax and he went away whistling! So there we were. The Col-o-nel and the lady with their idea on 

the woman question, the Armenians with their bizarre music, the Yankee with his freaky humour, 

and the sedentary gold dust twins from Kansas, and a great boat-load of others like them in their 

striking differences of ideals and notions, all hurrying across the world to help in the great fight for 

democracy which, in its essence, is only the right to live in the world, each man, each cult, each 

race, each blood and each nation after its own kind. And about all the war involves is the right to 

live, and to love one's own kind of women, one's own kind of music, one's own kind of humour, 

one's own kind of philosophy; knowing that they are not perfect and understanding their 

limitations; trusting to time and circumstance to bring out the fast colours of life in the eternal 

wash. Thinking thoughts like these that night, Henry's bunk-mate could not sleep. So he slipped 

on a grey overcoat over his pajamas and put on a grey hat and grey rubber-soled shoes, and went 

out on deck into the hot night that falls in the gulf stream in summer. It was the murky hour before 

dawn and around and around the deck he paced noiselessly, a grey, but hardly gaunt spectre in 

the night. The deck chairs were filled with sleepers from the berths below decks. At last, wearying 

of his rounds, the spectre stopped to gaze over the rail at the water and the stars when he heard 

this from a deck chair behind him, "Wake up, Net--for God's sake wake up!" whispered a 

frightened woman's voice. "There's that awful thing again that scared me so awhile ago!" 

[Illustration with caption: "Col-o-nel, will you please carry my books?"]  Even at the latter end of the 

journey the ocean interested us. An ocean always seems so unreasonable to inlanders. And that 

morning when there was "a grey mist on the sea's face and a grey dawn breaking," Henry came 

alongside and looked at the seascape, all twisting and writhing and tossing and billowing, up and 

down and sideways. He also looked at his partner who was gradually growing pale and wan and 

weary. And Henry heard this: "She's on a bender; she's riz about ten feet during the night. I guess 

there's been rain somewhere up near the headwaters or else the fellow took his finger out of the 

hole in the dyke. Anyway, she'll be out of her banks before breakfast. I don't want any breakfast; 

I'm going to bed for the day." And he went.  During the day Henry brought the cheerful information 

that the Doctor was down and that the Eager Soul and the Gilded Youth were wearing out the 



deck. Henry also added that her slapping was scheduled for that night.  "Has her hair slopped over 

yet?" This from me.  "No," answered Henry, "but it's getting crinklier and crinklier and she looks 

pinker and pinker, and prettier and prettier, and you ought to see her in her new purple sweater. 

She sprang that on the boat this afternoon! It's laying 'em out in swaths!" Henry's affinity was 

afraid to turn off his back. But he turned a pale face toward his side-kick and whispered: "Henry, 

you tell her," he gulped before going on, "that if she can't find anyone else to slap, there's a man 

down here who can't fight back!"  A sense of security comes to one who churns along seven days 

on a calm sea on an eventless voyage. And the French, by easy-going ways, stimulate that sense 

of security; we had heard weird stories of boat-drills at daybreak, of midnight alarms and of 

passengers sleeping on deck in their life preservers, and we were prepared for the thrills which 

Wichita and Emporia expected us to have. They never came. One afternoon, seven or eight days 

out, we had notice at noon that we would try on our life preservers that afternoon. The life 

preservers were thrown on our beds by the stewards and at three o'clock each passenger 

appeared beside the life-boat assigned to him, donned his life-belt which gave him a ridiculously 

stuffed appearance, answered to a roll-call, guyed those about him after the manner of old friends, 

and waited for something else. It never came. The ship's officers gradually faded from the decks 

and the passengers, after standing around foolishly for a time, disappeared one by one into their 

cabins and bloomed out again with their life-belts moulted! That was the last we heard of the boat-

drill or the life-belts. The French are just that casual.  But one evening at late twilight the ship went 

a-flutter over a grisly incident that brought us close up to the war. We were gathered in the dusk 

looking at a sailing ship far over to the south--a mere speck on the horizon's edge. Signals began 

to twinkle from her and we felt our ship give a lurch and turn north zigzagging at full speed. The 

signals of the sailing ship were distress signals, but we sped away from her as fast as our engines 

would take us, for, though her signals may have been genuine, also they may have been a U-boat 

lure. Often the Germans have used the lure of distress signals on a sailing ship and when a 

rescuer has appeared, the U-boat has sent to death the Good Samaritan of the sea! It is awful. But 

the German has put mercy off the sea!  Some way the average man goes back to his home 

environment for his moral standards, and that night as we walked the deck, Henry broke out with 

this: "I've been thinking about this U-boat business; how it would be if we had the German's job. I 

have been trying to think if there is any one in Wichita who could go out and run a U-boat the way 

these Germans run U-boats, and I've been trying to imagine him sitting on the front porch of the 

Country Club or down at the Elks Club talking about it, telling how he lured the captain of a ship by 

his distress signal to come to the rescue of a sinking ship and then destroyed the rescuer, and I've 

been trying to figure out how the fellows sitting around him would take it. They'd get up and leave. 

He would be outcast as unspeakable and no brag or bluff or blare of victory would gloss over his 

act. We simply don't think the German way. We have a loyalty to humanity deeper than our 

patriotism. There are certain things self-respecting men can't do and live in Wichita. But there 

seem to be no restrictions in Germany. The U-boat captain using the distress signal as a lure 

probably holds about such a place in his home town as Charley Carey, our banker, or Walter 

Innes, our dry goods man. He is doubtless a leading citizen of some German town; doubtless a 

kind father, a good husband and maybe a pillar of the church. And I suppose town and home and 

church will applaud him when he goes back to Germany to brag about his treachery. In Wichita, 



town and home and church would be ashamed of Charley Carey and Walter Innes if they came 

back to brag about killing men who were lured to death by responding to the call of distress."  And 

so, having disposed of the psychology of the enemy, we turned in for the night. We were entering 

the danger zone and the night was hot. A few passengers slept on deck; but most of the ship's 

company went to their cabins. We didn't seem to be afraid. We presumed that our convoy would 

appear in the morning. But when it failed to appear we assumed that there was no danger. No 

large French passenger boat had been sunk by the Germans; this fact we heard a dozen times 

that day. It soothed us. The day passed without bringing our convoy. Again we went to bed, 

realizing rather clearly that the French do take things casually; and believing firmly that the 

convoys would come with the dawn. But dawn came and brought no convoy. We seemed to be 

nearing land. The horizon was rarely without a boat. The day grew bright. We were almost through 

the danger zone. We went to lunch a gay lot, all of us; but we hurried back to the deck; not 

uneasily, not in fear, understand, but just to be on deck, looking landward. And then at two o'clock 

it appeared. Far off in the northeast was a small black dot in the sky. It looked like a seabird; but it 

grew. In ten minutes the whole deck was excited. Every glass was focused on the growing black 

spot. And then it loomed up the size of a baseball; it showed colour, a dull yellow in the distance 

and then it swelled and took form and glowed brighter and came rushing toward us, as large as a 

moon, as large as a barrel, and then we saw its outlines, and it came swooping over us, a great 

beautiful golden thing and the whole deck burst into cheers. It was our convoy, a dirigible balloon--

vivid golden yellow, trimmed with blue! How fair it seemed. How graceful and how surely and how 

powerfully it circled about the ship like a great hovering bird, and how safe we felt; and as we 

cheered and cheered the swirling, glowing, beautiful thing, we knew how badly frightened we 

really had been. With danger gone, the tension lifted and we read the fear in our hearts. A torpedo 

boat destroyer came lumbering across the sky line. It also was to convoy us, but it had a most 

undramatic entrance; and besides we had sighted land. The deck cheered easily, so we cheered 

the land. And everyone ran about exclaiming to everyone else about the wonder and splendour of 

the balloon, and everyone took pictures of everyone else and promised to send prints, and the 

land waxed fat and loomed large and hospitable while Henry paced the deck with his hands 

clasped reflectively behind him. He was deeply moved and language didn't satisfy him much. 

Finally he took his fellow Kansan by the arm and pointed to the magnificence of the hovering 

spectre in yellow and blue that circled about the ship:  "Bill," he said, solemnly, "isn't she a peach!" 

He paused, then from his heart he burst out: "'How beautiful upon the mountain are the feet of 

them that bring glad tidings!' I wish the fellows in Wichita could get this thing for the wheat show!" 

And thus we came to the shores of sunny France, a land that was to remind us over and over 

again of our own sunny land of Kansas.  We landed after dark. Every one was going about vowing 

deathless friendship to every one else, and so far as the stenographers and the ambulance boys 

were concerned, it came to Henry and me that we meant it; for they were a fine lot, just joyous, 

honest, brave young Americans going out to do their little part in a big enterprise. While we were 

bidding good-bye to our boys and girls, we kept a weather eye on the Eager Soul. She had 

hooked the Gilded Youth fairly deeply. He saw that her trunk came up from the hold, but we 

noticed that while he was gone, the Doctor showed up and went with her to sort out her hand-

baggage from the pile on the deck. The gang plank was let down under a pair of smoky torches. 



And the Gilded Youth had paid a fine tip some place to be permitted to be the first passenger off 

the boat that he might get one of the two taxis in sight for the Eager Soul. She followed him, but 

she made him let the Doctor come along. And so the drinks--lemon squash and buttermilk--were 

equally on Henry and me. We hurried down the gang plank after the happy trio. They were young--

so infinitely and ineffably young, it seemed to us. And the girl's face was flushed and joyous, and 

her hair--why it didn't shake out and drown her we never knew; certainly it surged out from under 

her hat like ripples of youth incarnate. We saw them stacking their valises in the taxi and over the 

taxi and around the taxi and the last we saw of her was when she bent out of the cab window and 

waved and smiled at us, two sedate old parties alone there in the crowd, with the French language 

rising to our ears as we teetered unsteadily into it.  What an adventure they were going into--what 

a new adventure, the new and beautiful adventure of youth, the old and inexplicable adventure of 

life! So we waved back at them so long as they were in sight, and the white handkerchief of the 

Eager Soul fluttered back from the disappearing cab. When it was gone, Henry turned to a sad-

looking cabman with a sway-backed carriage and explained with much eloquence that we wanted 

him to haul us a la hotel France--toot sweet!  [Illustration with caption: So we waved back at them 

so long as they were in sight]     CHAPTER II  IN WHICH WE OBSERVE THE "ROCKET'S RED 

GLARE"   Bordeaux is the "Somewhere in France" from which cablegrams from passengers on 

the French liners usually are sent. This will be no news to the Germans, nor to Americans who 

read the advertisements of the French liners, but it may be news to Americans who receive the 

mysterious cablegrams "from a French port," after their friends have landed. It is a dear old town, 

mouldy, and weather-beaten, and mediaeval, this Bordeaux, with high, mysterious civilization, 

communication by rivers contributes powerfully to generalize languages, manners, and political 

institutions; but in the impenetrable forests of the torrid zone, as in the first rude condition of our 

species, rivers increase the dismemberment of great nations, favour the transition of dialects into 

languages that appear to us radically distinct, and keep up national hatred and mistrust. Between 

the banks of the Caura and the Padamo everything bears the stamp of disunion and weakness. 

Men avoid, because they do not understand, each other; they mutually hate, because they 

mutually fear.  When we examine attentively this wild part of America, we fancy ourselves 

transported to those primitive times when the earth was peopled by degrees, and we seem to be 

present at the birth of human societies. In the old world we see that pastoral life has prepared the 

hunting nations for agriculture. In the New World we seek in vain these progressive developments 

of civilization, these intervals of repose, these stages in the life of nations. The luxury of vegetation 

embarrasses the Indians in the chase; and in their rivers, resembling arms of the sea, the depth of 

the waters prevents fishing during whole months. Those species of ruminating animals, that 

constitute the wealth of the nations of the Old World, are wanting in the New. The bison and the 

musk-ox have never been reduced to a domestic state; the breeding of llamas and guanacos has 

not created the habits of pastoral life. In the temperate zone, on the banks of the Missouri, as well 

as on the tableland of New Mexico, the American is a hunter; but in the torrid zone, in the forests 

of Guiana, he cultivates cassava, plantains, and sometimes maize. Such is the admirable fertility 

of nature, that the field of the native is a little spot of land, to clear which requires only setting fire 

to the brambles; and putting a few seeds or slips into the ground is all the husbandry it demands. If 

we go back in thought to the most remote ages, in these thick forests we must always figure to 



ourselves nations deriving the greater part of their nourishment from the earth; but, as this earth 

produces abundance in a small space, and almost without toil, we may also imagine these nations 

often changing their dwellings along the banks of the same river. Even now the native of the 

Orinoco travels with his seeds; and transports his farm (conuco) as the Arab transports his tent, 

and changes his pasturage. The number of cultivated plants found wild amid the woods, proves 

the nomad habits of an agricultural people. Can we be surprised, that by these habits they lose 

almost all the advantages that result in the temperate zone from stationary culture, from the 

growth of corn, which requires extensive lands and the most assiduous labour?  The nations of the 

Upper Orinoco, the Atabapo, and the Inirida, like the ancient Germans and the Persians, have no 

other worship than that of the powers of nature. They call the good principle Cachimana; it is the 

Manitou, the Great Spirit, that regulates the seasons, and favours the harvests. Along with 

Cachimana there is an evil principle, Iolokiamo, less powerful, but more artful, and in particular 

more active. The Indians of the forest, when they occasionally visit the missions, conceive with 

difficulty the idea of a temple or an image. "These good people," said the missionary, "like only 

processions in the open air. When I last celebrated the festival of San Antonio, the patron of my 

village, the Indians of Inirida were present at mass. 'Your God,' said they to me, 'keeps himself 

shut up in a house, as if he were old and infirm; ours is in the forest, in the fields, and on the 

mountains of Sipapu, whence the rains come.'" Among the more numerous, and on this account 

less barbarous tribes, religious societies of a singular kind are formed. Some old Indians pretend 

to be better instructed than others on points regarding divinity; and to them is confided the famous 

botuto, of which I have spoken, and which is sounded under the palm-trees that they may bear 

abundance of fruit. On the banks of the Orinoco there exists no idol, as among all the nations who 

have remained faithful to the first worship of nature, but the botuto, the sacred trumpet, is an 

object of veneration. To be initiated into the mysteries of the botuto, it is requisite to be of pure 

morals, and to have lived single. The initiated are subjected to flagellations, fastings, and other 

painful exercises. There are but a small number of these sacred trumpets. The most anciently 

celebrated is that upon a hill near the confluence of the Tomo and the Guainia. It is pretended, that 

it is heard at once on the banks of the Tuamini, and at the mission of San Miguel de Davipe, a 

distance of ten leagues. Father Cereso assured us, that the Indians speak of the botuto of Tomo 

as an object of worship common to many surrounding tribes. Fruit and intoxicating liquors are 

placed beside the sacred trumpet. Sometimes the Great Spirit himself makes the botuto resound; 

sometimes he is content to manifest his will through him to whom the keeping of the instrument is 

entrusted. These juggleries being very ancient (from the fathers of our fathers, say the Indians), 

we must not be surprised that some unbelievers are already to be found; but they express their 

disbelief of the mysteries of the botuto only in whispers. Women are not permitted to see this 

marvellous instrument; and are excluded from all the ceremonies of this worship. If a woman have 

the misfortune to see the trumpet, she is put to death without mercy. The missionary related to us, 

that in 1798 he was happy enough to save a young girl, whom a jealous and vindictive lover 

accused of having followed, from a motive of curiosity, the Indians who sounded the botuto in the 

plantations. "They would not have murdered her publicly," said father Cesero, "but how was she to 

be protected from the fanaticism of the natives, in a country where it is so easy to give poison? 

The young girl told me of her fears, and I sent her to one of the missions of the Lower Orinoco." If 



the people of Guiana had remained masters of that vast country; if, without having been impeded 

by Christian settlements, they could follow freely the development of their barbarous institutions; 

the worship of the botuto would no doubt become of some political importance. That mysterious 

society of the initiated, those guardians of the sacred trumpet, would be transformed into a ruling 

caste of priests, and the oracle of Tomo would gradually form a link between the bordering 

nations.  In the evening of the 4th of May we were informed, that an Indian, who had assisted in 

dragging our bark over the portage of Pimichin, had been stung by a viper. He was a tall strong 

man, and was brought to the mission in a very alarming state. He had dropped down senseless; 

and nausea, vertigo, and congestions in the head, had succeeded the fainting. The liana called 

vejeco de guaco,* which M. Mutis has rendered so celebrated, and which is the most certain 

remedy for the bite of venomous serpents, is yet unknown in these countries. (* This is a mikania, 

which was confounded for some time in Europe with the ayapana. De Candolle thinks that the 

guaco may be the Eupatorium satureiaefolium of Lamarck; but this Eupatorium differs by its 

lineary leaves, while the Mikania guaco has triangular, oval, and very large leaves.) A number of 

Indians hastened to the hut of the sick man, and he was cured by an infusion of raiz de mato. We 

cannot indicate with certainty what plant furnishes this antidote; but I am inclined to think, that the 

raiz de mato is an apocynea, perhaps the Cerbera thevetia, called by the inhabitants of Cumana 

lingua de mato or contra-culebra, and which they also use against the bite of serpents. A genus 

nearly allied to the cerbera* (* Ophioxylon serpentinum.) is employed in India for the same 

purpose. It is common enough to find in the same family of plants vegetable poisons, and 

antidotes against the venom of reptiles. Many tonics and narcotics are antidotes more or less 

active; and we find these in families very different* from each other, in the aristolochiae, the 

apocyneae, the gentianae, the polygalae, the solaneae, the compositae, the malvaceae, the 

drymyrhizeae, and, which is still more surprising, even in the palm-trees. (* I shall mention as 

examples of these nine families; Aristolochia anguicida, Cerbera thevetia, Ophoiorhiza mungos, 

Polygala senega, Nicotiana tabacum, (One of the remedies most used in Spanish America). 

Mikanua guaco, Hibiscus abelmoschus (the seeds of which are very active), Lanpujum rumphii, 

and Kunthia montana (Cana de la Vibora).)  In the hut of the Indian who had been so dangerously 

bitten by the viper, we found balls two or three inches in diameter, of an earthy and impure salt 

called chivi, which is prepared with great care by the natives. At Maypures a conferva is burnt, 

which is left by the Orinoco on the neighbouring rocks, when, after high swellings, it again enters 

its bed. At Javita a salt is fabricated by the incineration of the spadix and fruit of the palm-tree seje 

or chimu. This fine palm-tree, which abounds on the banks of the Auvana, near the cataract of 

Guarinumo, and between Javita and the Cano Pimichin, appears to be a new species of cocoa-

tree. It may be recollected, that the fluid contained in the fruit of the common cocoa-tree is often 

saline, even when the tree grows far from the sea shore. At Madagascar salt is extracted from the 

sap of a palm-tree called ciro. Besides the spadix and the fruit of the seje palm, the Indians of 

Javita lixiviate also the ashes of the famous liana called cupana, which is a new species of the 

genus paullinia, consequently a very different plant from the cupania of Linnaeus. I may here 

mention, that a missionary seldom travels without being provided with some prepared seeds of the 

cupana. This preparation requires great care. The Indians scrape the seeds, mix them with flour of 

cassava, envelope the mass in plantain leaves, and set it to ferment in water, till it acquires a 



saffron-yellow colour. This yellow paste dried in the sun, and diluted in water, is taken in the 

morning as a kind of tea. The beverage is bitter and stomachic, but it appeared to me to have a 

very disagreeable taste.  On the banks of the Niger, and in a great part of the interior of Africa, 

where salt is extremely rare, it is said of a rich man, "he is so fortunate as to eat salt at his meals." 

This good fortune is not too common in the interior of Guiana. The whites only, particularly the 

soldiers of the little fort of San Carlos, know how to procure pure salt, either from the coast of 

Caracas, or from Chita* by the Rio Meta. (* North of Morocote, at the eastern declivity of the 

Cordillera of New Grenada. The salt of the coasts, which the Indians call yuquira, costs two 

piastres the almuda at San Carlos.) Here, as throughout America, the Indians eat little meat, and 

consume scarcely any salt. The chivi of Javita is a mixture of muriate of potash and of soda, of 

caustic lime, and of several other earthy salts. The Indians dissolve a few particles in water, fill 

with this solution a leaf of heliconia folded in a conical form, and let drop a little, as from the 

extremity of a filter, on their food.  On the 5th of May we set off, to follow on foot our canoe, which 

had at length arrived, by the portage, at the Cano Pimichin. We had to ford a great number of 

streams; and these passages require some caution on account of the vipers with which the 

marshes abound. The Indians pointed out to us on the moist clay the traces of the little black bears 

so common on the banks of the Temi. They differ at least in size from the Ursus americanus. The 

missionaries call them osso carnicero, to distinguish them from the osso palmero or tamanoir 

(Myrmecophaga jubata), and from the osso hormigero, or anteater (tamandua). The flesh of these 

animals is good to eat; the first two defend themselves by rising on their hind feet. The tamanoir of 

Buffon is called uaraca by the Indians; it is irascible and courageous, which is extraordinary in an 

animal without teeth. We found, as we advanced, some vistas in the forest, which appeared to us 

the richer, as it became more accessible. We here gathered some new species of coffee (the 

American tribe, with flowers in panicles, forms probably a particular genus); the Galega 

piscatorum, of which the Indians make use, as they do of jacquinia, and of a composite plant of 

the Rio Temi, as a kind of barbasco, to intoxicate fish; and finally, the liana, known in those 

countries by the name of vejuco de mavacure, which yields the famous curare poison. It is neither 

a phyllanthus, nor a coriaria, as M. Willdenouw conjectured, but, as M. Kunth's researches show, 

very probably a strychnos. We shall have occasion, farther on, to speak of this venomous 

substance, which is an important object of trade among the savages.  The trees of the forest of 

Pimichin have the gigantic height of from eighty to a hundred and twenty feet. In these burning 

climates the laurineae and amyris* (* The great white and red cedars of these countries are not 

the Cedrela odorata, but the Amyris altissima, which is an icica of Aublet.) furnish that fine timber 

for building, which, on the north-west coast of America, on mountains where the thermometer falls 

in winter to 20 degrees centigrade below zero, we find in the family of the coniferae. Such, in every 

zone, and in all the families of American plants, is the prodigious force of vegetation, that, in the 

latitude of fifty-seven degrees north, on the same isothermal line with St. Petersburgh and the 

Orkneys, the Pinus canadensis displays trunks one hundred and fifty feet high, and six feet in 

diameter.* (* Langsdorf informs us that the inhabitants of Norfolk Sound make boats of a single 

trunk, fifty feet long, four feet and a half broad, and three high at the sides. They contain thirty 

persons. These boats remind us of the canoes of the Rio Chagres in the isthmus of Panama, in 

the torrid zone. The Populus balsamifera also attains an immense height, on the mountains that 



border Norfolk Sound.) Towards night we arrived at a small farm, in the puerto or landing place of 

Pimichin. We were shown a cross near the road, which marked the spot where a poor capuchin 

missionary had been killed by wasps. I state this on the authority of the monks of Javita and the 

Indians. They talk much in these countries of wasps and venomous ants, but we saw neither one 

nor the other of these insects. It is well known that in the torrid zone slight stings often cause fits of 

fever almost as violent as those that with us accompany severe organic injuries. The death of this 

poor monk was probably the effect of fatigue and damp, rather than of the venom contained in the 

stings of wasps, which the Indians dread extremely. We must not confound the wasps of Javita 

with the melipones bees, called by the Spaniards angelitos (little angels) which covered our faces 

and hands on the summit of the Silla de Caracas.  The landing place of Pimichin is surrounded by 

a small plantation of cacao-trees; they are very vigorous, and here, as on the banks of the 

Atabapo and the Guainia, they are loaded with flowers and fruits at all seasons. They begin to 

bear from the fourth year; on the coast of Caracas they do not bear till the sixth or eighth year. The 

soil of these countries is sandy, wherever it is not marshy; but the light lands of the Tuamini and 

Pimichin are extremely productive.* (* At Javita, an extent of fifty feet square, planted with 

Jatropha manihot (yucca) yields in two years, in the worst soil, a harvest of six tortas of cassava: 

the same extent on a middling soil yields in fourteen months a produce of nine tortas. In an 

excellent soil, around clumps of mauritia, there is every year from fifty feet square a produce of 

thirteen or fourteen tortas. A torta weighs three quarters of a pound, and three tortas cost 

generally in the province of Caracas one silver rial, or one-eighth of a piastre. These statements 

appear to me to be of some importance, when we wish to compare the nutritive matter which man 

can obtain from the same extent of soil, by covering it, in different climates, with bread-trees, 

plantains, jatropha, maize, potatoes, rice, and corn. The tardiness of the harvest of jatropha has, I 

believe, a beneficial influence on the manners of the natives, by fixing them to the soil, and 

compelling them to sojourn long on the same spot.) Around the conucos of Pimichin grows, in its 

wild state, the igua, a tree resembling the Caryocar nuciferum which is cultivated in Dutch and 

French Guiana, and which, with the almendron of Mariquita (Caryocar amygdaliferum), the juvia of 

the Esmeralda (Bertholletia excelsa), and the Geoffroea of the Amazon, yields the finest almonds 

of all South America. No commercial advantage is here made of the igua; but I saw vessels arrive 

on the coast of Terra Firma, that came from Demerara laden with the fruit of the Caryocar 

tomentosum, which is the Pekea tuberculosa of Aublet. These trees reach a hundred feet in 

height, and present, by the beauty of their corolla, and the multitude of their stamens, a 

magnificent appearance. I should weary the reader by continuing the enumeration of the vegetable 

wonders which these vast forests contain. Their variety depends on the coexistence of such a 

great number of families in a small space of ground, on the stimulating power of light and heat, 

and on the perfect elaboration of the juices that circulate in these gigantic plants.  We passed the 

night in a hut lately abandoned by an Indian family, who had left behind them their fishing-tackle, 

pottery, nets made of the petioles of palm-trees; in short, all that composes the household furniture 

of that careless race of men, little attached to property. A great store of mani (a mixture of the 

resin of the moronoboea and the Amyris carana) was accumulated round the house. This is used 

by the Indians here, as at Cayenne, to pitch their canoes, and fix the bony spines of the ray at the 

points of their arrows. We found in the same place jars filled with a vegetable milk, which serves 



as a varnish, and is celebrated in the missions by the name of leche para pintar (milk for painting). 

They coat with this viscous juice those articles of furniture to which they wish to give a fine white 

colour. It thickens by the contact of the air, without growing yellow, and it appears singularly 

glossy. We have already mentioned that the caoutchouc is the oily part, the butter of all vegetable 

milk. It is, no doubt, a particular modification of caoutchouc that forms this coagulum, this white 

and glossy skin, that seems as if covered with copal varnish. If different colours could be given to 

this milky varnish, a very expeditious method would be found of painting and varnishing our 

carriages by one process. The more we study vegetable chemistry in the torrid zone, the more we 

shall discover, in remote spots, and half-prepared in the organs of plants, products which we 

believe belong only to the animal kingdom, or which we obtain by processes which are often 

tedious and difficult. Already we have found the wax that coats the palm-tree of the Andes of 

Quindiu, the silk of the palm-tree of Mocoa, the nourishing milk of the palo de vaca, the butter-tree 

of Africa, and the caseous substances obtained from the almost animalized sap of the Carica 

papaya. These discoveries will be multiplied, when, as the political state of the world seems now 

to indicate, European civilization shall flow in a great measure toward the equinoctial regions of 

the New Continent.  The marshy tract between Javita and the embarcadero of Pimichin is infested 

with great numbers of vipers. Before we took possession of the deserted hut, the Indians killed two 

great mapanare serpents.* (* This name is given in the Spanish colonies to very different species. 

The Coluber mapanare of the province of Caracas has one hundred and forty-two ventral plates, 

and thirty-eight double caudal scales. The Coluber mapanare of the Rio Magdalena has two 

hundred and eight ventral plates, and sixty-four double caudal scales.) These grow to four or five 

feet long. They appeared to me to be the same species as those I saw in the Rio Magdalena. This 

serpent is a beautiful animal, but extremely venomous, white on the belly, and spotted with brown 

and red on the back. As the inside of the hut was filled with grass, and we were lying on the 

ground, there being no means of suspending our hammocks, we were not without inquietude 

during the night. In the morning a large viper was found on lifting the jaguar-skin upon which one 

of our domestics had slept. The Indians say that these reptiles, slow in their movements when they 

are not pursued, creep near a man because they are fond of heat. In fact, on the banks of the 

Magdalena a serpent entered the bed of one of our fellow-travellers, and remained there a part of 

the night, without injuring him. Without wishing to take up the defence of vipers and rattlesnakes, I 

believe it may be affirmed that, if these venomous animals had such a disposition for offence as is 

supposed, the human species would certainly not have withstood their numbers in some parts of 

America; for instance, on the banks of the Orinoco and the humid mountains of Choco.  We 

embarked on the 8th of May at sunrise, after having carefully examined the bottom of our canoe. It 

had become thinner, but had received no crack in the portage. We reckoned that it would still bear 

the voyage of three hundred leagues, which we had yet to perform, in going down the Rio Negro, 

ascending the Cassiquiare, and redescending the Orinoco as far as Angostura. The Pimichin, 

which is called a rivulet (cano) is tolerably broad; but small trees that love the water narrow the 

bed so much that there remains open a channel of only fifteen or twenty toises. Next to the Rio 

Chagres this river is one of the most celebrated in America for the number of its windings: it is 


_
street's over which hang dusty branches of trees or vines sneaking mischievously out of bounds. A 

woe-begone trolley creaks through the narrow streets and heart-broken cabmen mourning over 

the mistakes of misspent lives, larrup disconsolate horses over stony streets as they creak and jog 

and wheeze ahead of the invisible crows that seem always to be hovering above ready to batten 

upon their rightful provender. For an hour in the morning before our train left for Paris we chartered 

one of the ramshackle cabs of the town and took in Bordeaux. It was vastly unlike either Emporia 

or Wichita, or anything in Kansas, or anything in America; or so far as that goes, to Henry and me, 

it was unlike anything else in the wide and beautiful world. "All this needs," said Henry, as he lolled 

back upon the moth-eaten cushions of the hack that banged its iron rims on the cobbles beneath 

us, and sent the thrill of it into our teeth, "all this needs is Mary Pickford and a player organ to be a 

good film!" The only thing we saw that made us homesick was the group of firemen in front of the 

engine house playing checkers or chess or something. But the town had an historic interest for us 

as the home of the Girondists of the French Revolution; so we looked up their monument and did 

proper reverence to them. They were moderate idealists who rose during the first year of the 

revolution; we thought them much like the Bull Moosers. So we did what homage we could to the 

Girondists who were run over by the revolutionary band wagon and sent to the guillotine during the 

Terror. For we knew; indeed into the rolly-poly necks of Henry and me, in our own politics, the 

knife had bitten many times. So we stood before what seemed to be the proper monument with 

sympathetic eyes and uncovered heads for a second before we took the train for Paris.  All day 

long we rode through the only peaceful part of France we were to see in our martial adventures. It 

was fair and fat and smiling--that France that lay between the river Gironde and Paris, and all day 

we rode through its beauty and its richness. The thing which we missed most from the landscape, 

being used to the American landscape, was the automobile. We did not see one in the day's 

journey. In Kansas alone there are 190,000 continually pervading the landscape. We had yet to 

learn that there are no private automobiles in France, that the government had commandeered all 

automobiles and that even the taxis of Paris have but ten gallons of gasoline a day allotted to each 

of them. So we gazed at the two-wheeled carts, the high, bony, strong white oxen, the ribbons of 

roads, hard-surfaced and beautiful, wreathing the gentle hills, and longed for a car to make the 

journey past the fine old chateaux that flashed in and out of our vision behind the hills. War was a 

million miles away from the pastoral France that we saw coming up from Bordeaux.  But in Paris 

war met us far out in the suburbs, where at dusk a great flock of airplanes from a training camp 

buzzed over us and sailed along with the train, distancing us and returning to play with us like big 

sportive birds. The train was filled with our shipmates from the boat and we all craned our necks 

from the windows to look at the wonderful sight of the air covey that fluttered above us. Even the 

Eager Soul, our delicious young person with her crinkly red hair and serious eyes, disconnected 

herself long enough from the Gilded Youth and the Young Doctor "for to admire and for to see," 

the airplanes.  But the airplanes gave us the day's first opportunity to talk to the Eager Soul. Until 

dusk the Gilded Youth had kept her in his donjon--a first class compartment jammed with hand-

baggage, and where she had insisted that the Young Doctor should come also. We knew that 

without being told; also it was evident as we passed up and down the car aisle during the day that 

she was acting as a sort of human Baedeker to the Young Doctor, while the Gilded Youth, to 

whom chateaux and French countryside were an old, old story, sat by and hooted. But the 



airplanes pulled him out of his donjon keep and the Young Doctor with him. He wasn't above 

showing the Young Doctor how much a Gilded Youth really knows about mechanics and 

airplanes, and we slipped in and chatted with the Eager Soul. We had a human interest in the 

contest between the Gilded Youth and the Young Doctor, and a sporting interest which centered in 

the daily score. And we gathered this: That it was the Young Doctor's day. For he was in France to 

help the greatest cause in the world; and the Gilded Youth affected to be in France--to enjoy the 

greatest outdoor game in the world. But he had made it plain that day to the Eager Soul that 

working eighteen hours a day under shell fire, driving an ambulance, was growing tame. He was 

going back, of course, but he was thinking seriously of the air service. The Doctor wanted no 

thrills. He was willing to boil surgical instruments or squirt disinfectant around kitchens to serve. 

And the Eager Soul liked that attitude, though it was obvious to us, that she was in the war game 

as a bit of a sport and because it was too dull in her Old Home Town, "somewhere in the United 

States." And we knew also what she did not admit, even if she recognized it, that in the Old Home 

Town, men of the sort to attract women of her spirit and intelligence were scarce--and she was out 

looking for her own Sir Galahad, as he went up and down the earth searching for the Holy Grail. 

The war to her, we knew, was a great opportunity to enjoy the new freedom of her sex, to lose her 

harem veil, to breathe free air as an achieving human creature--but, alas! one's forties are too 

wise. Pretty as she was, innocent as she was, and eager as her soul was in high emprise of the 

conflict of world ideals into which she was plunging, we felt that, after all, hidden away deeply in 

the secret places of her heart, were a man and a home and children.  We whizzed through the 

dusk in the suburbs of Paris that night, seeing the gathering implements of war coming into the 

landscape for the first time--the army trucks, the horizon blue of the French uniform, the great 

training camps, the Red Cross store houses, the scores and scores of hospitals that might be 

seen in the public buildings with Red Cross flags on them, the munition plants pouring out their 

streams of women workers in their jumpers and overalls.  The girl porters came through and 

turned on the lights in the train. No lights outside told us that we were hurrying through a great city. 

Paris was dark. We went through the underground where there was more light than there was 

above ground. The streets seemed like tunnels and the tunnels like streets. We came into the 

dingy station and a score of women porters and red capped girls came for our baggage. They ran 

the trucks, they moved the express; they took care of the mail, and through them we edged up the 

stairway into the half-lighted station and looked out into the night--black, lampless, engulfing--and 

it was Paris!  It was nine o'clock as we stood on the threshold of the station peering into the murk. 

Not a taxi was in the stand waiting; but from afar we could hear a great honking of auto-horns, that 

sounded like the night calls of monster birds flitting over the city. The air was vibrant with these 

wild calls. We were an hour waiting there in the gloom for a conveyance. But when we left the 

wide square about the station, and came into the streets of Paris, we understood why the auto 

horns were bellowing so. For the automobiles were running lickety-split through the darkness 

without lights and the howls of their horns pierced the night. The few street lights burning a low 

candle power at the intersections of the great boulevards were hooded and cast but a pale glow 

on the pavements. And as we rode from our station and passed the Tuileries and the Rue de 

Rivoli, save for the dim outline of the iron railings of the said to have eighty-five, which greatly 

lengthen it. They often form right angles, and occur every two or three leagues. To determine the 



difference of longitude between the landing-place and the point where we were to enter the Rio 

Negro, I took by the compass the course of the Cano Pimichin, and noted the time during which 

we followed the same direction. The velocity of the current was only 2.4 feet in a second; but our 

canoe made by rowing 4.6 feet. The embarcadero of the Pimichin appeared to me to be eleven 

thousand toises west of its mouth, and 0 degrees 2 minutes west of the mission of Javita. This 

Cano is navigable during the whole year, and has but one raudal, which is somewhat difficult to go 

up; its banks are low, but rocky. After having followed the windings of the Pimichin for four hours 

and a half we at length entered the Rio Negro.  The morning was cool and beautiful. We had now 

been confined thirty-six days in a narrow boat, so unsteady that it would have been overset by any 

person rising imprudently from his seat, without warning the rowers. We had suffered severely 

from the sting of insects, but we had withstood the insalubrity of the climate; we had passed 

without accident the great number of waterfalls and bars, which impede the navigation of the 

rivers, and often render it more dangerous than long voyages by sea. After all we had endured, it 

may be conceived that we felt no little satisfaction in having reached the tributary streams of the 

Amazon, having passed the isthmus that separates two great systems of rivers, and in being sure 

of having fulfilled the most important object of our journey, namely, to determine astronomically the 

course of that arm of the Orinoco which falls into the Rio Negro, and of which the existence has 

been alternately proved and denied during half a century. In proportion as we draw near to an 

object we have long had in view, its interest seems to augment. The uninhabited banks of the 

Cassiquiare, covered with forests, without memorials of times past, then occupied my imagination, 

as do now the banks of the Euphrates, or the Oxus, celebrated in the annals of civilized nations. In 

that interior part of the New Continent one may almost accustom oneself to regard men as not 

being essential to the order of nature. The earth is loaded with plants, and nothing impedes their 

free development. An immense layer of mould manifests the uninterrupted action of organic 

powers. Crocodiles and boas are masters of the river; the jaguar, the peccary, the dante, and the 

monkeys traverse the forest without fear and without danger; there they dwell as in an ancient 

inheritance. This aspect of animated nature, in which man is nothing, has something in it strange 

and sad. To this we reconcile ourselves with difficulty on the ocean, and amid the sands of Africa; 

though in scenes where nothing recalls to mind our fields, our woods, and our streams, we are 

less astonished at the vast solitude through which we pass. Here, in a fertile country, adorned with 

eternal verdure, we seek in vain the traces of the power of man; we seem to be transported into a 

world different from that which gave us birth. These impressions are the more powerful in 

proportion as they are of long duration. A soldier, who had spent his whole life in the missions of 

the Upper Orinoco, slept with us on the bank of the river. He was an intelligent man, who, during a 

calm and serene night, pressed me with questions on the magnitude of the stars, on the 

inhabitants of the moon, on a thousand subjects of which I was as ignorant as himself. Being 

unable by my answers to satisfy his curiosity, he said to me in a firm tone of the most positive 

conviction: "with respect to men, I believe there are no more up there than you would have found if 

you had gone by land from Javita to Cassiquiare. I think I see in the stars, as here, a plain covered 

with grass, and a forest (mucho monte) traversed by a river." In citing these words I paint the 

impression produced by the monotonous aspect of those solitary regions. May this monotony not 

be found to extend to the journal of our navigation, and weary the reader accustomed to the 



description of the scenes and historical memorials of the old continent!   CHAPTER 2.23.  THE 

RIO NEGRO. BOUNDARIES OF BRAZIL. THE CASSIQUIARE. BIFURCATION OF THE 

ORINOCO.  The Rio Negro, compared to the Amazon, the Rio de la Plata, or the Orinoco, is but a 

river of the second order. Its possession has been for ages of great political importance to the 

Spanish Government, because it is capable of furnishing a rival power, Portugal, with an easy 

passage into the missions of Guiana, and thereby disturbing the Capitania general of Caracas in 

its southern limits. Three hundred years have been spent in vain territorial disputes. According to 

the difference of times, and the degree of civilization among the natives, resource has been had 

sometimes to the authority of the Pope, and sometimes the support of astronomy; and the 

disputants being generally more interested in prolonging than in terminating the struggle, the 

nautical sciences and the geography of the New Continent, have alone gained by this interminable 

litigation. When the affairs of Paraguay, and the possession of the colony of Del Sacramento, 

became of great importance to the courts of Madrid and Lisbon, commissioners of the boundaries 

were sent to the Orinoco, the Amazon, and the Rio Plata.  The little that was known, up to the end 

of the last century, of the astronomical geography of the interior of the New Continent, was owing 

to these estimable and laborious men, the French and Spanish academicians, who measured a 

meridian line at Quito, and to officers who went from Valparaiso to Buenos Ayres to join the 

expedition of Malaspina. Those persons who know the inaccuracy of the maps of South America, 

and have seen those uncultivated lands between the Jupura and the Rio Negro, the Madeira and 

the Ucayale, the Rio Branco and the coasts of Cayenne, which up to our own days have been 

gravely disputed in Europe, can be not a little surprised at the perseverance with which the 

possession of a few square leagues is litigated. These disputed grounds are generally separated 

from the cultivated part of the colonies by deserts, the extent of which is unknown. In the 

celebrated conferences of Puente de Caya the question was agitated, whether, in fixing the line of 

demarcation three hundred and seventy Spanish leagues to the west of the Cape Verde Islands, 

the pope meant that the first meridian should be reckoned from the centre of the island of St. 

Nicholas, or (as the court of Portugal asserted) from the western extremity of the little island of St. 

Antonio. In the year 1754, the time of the expedition of Iturriaga and Solano, negociations were 

entered into respecting the possession of the then desert banks of the Tuamini, and of a marshy 

tract which we crossed in one evening going from Javita to Cano Pimichin. The Spanish 

commissioners very recently would have placed the divisional line at the point where the Apoporis 

falls into the Jupura, while the Portuguese astronomers carried it back as far as Salto Grande. 

The Rio Negro and the Jupuro are two tributary streams of the Amazon, and may be compared in 

length to the Danube. The upper parts belong to the Spaniards, while the lower are occupied by 

the Portuguese. The Christian settlements are very numerous from Mocoa to the mouth of the 

Caguan; while on the Lower Jupura the Portuguese have founded only a few villages. On the Rio 

Negro, on the contrary, the Spaniards have not been able to rival their neighbours. Steppes and 

forests nearly desert separate, at a distance of one hundred and sixty leagues, the cultivated part 

of the coast from the four missions of Marsa, Tomo, Davipe, and San Carlos, which are all that the 

Spanish Franciscans could establish along the Rio Negro. Among the Portuguese of Brazil the 

military 


_
our way. Yet our cab whizzed along at a twenty-five mile gait, and every few seconds a great 

blatting devil would honk out of the darkness, and whirl past us, and sometimes we would be 

abreast of another and the fiendish horns of us would go screaming in chorus as we raced and 

passed and repassed one another on the broad street. The din was nerve racking--but highly 

Parisian. One fancied that Paris, being denied its lights, made up its quota of sensation by 

multiplying its sound!  We went to the Ritz--now smile; the others did! Not that the Ritz is an 

inferior hotel. We went there because it was really the grandee among Paris hotels. Yet every day 

we were in Paris when we told people we were at the Ritz, they smiled. The human mind doesn't 

seem to be able to associate Henry and me with the Ritz without the sense of the eternal fitness of 

things going wapper-jawed and catawampus. We are that kind of men. Wichita and Emporia are 

written large and indelibly upon us; and the Ritz, which is the rendezvous of the nobility, merely 

becomes a background for our rusticity--the spotlight which reveals the everlasting jay in us! We 

went to the Ritz largely because it seemed to me that as a leading American orator, Henry should 

have proper European terminal facilities. And the Ritz looked to me like the proper setting for an 

international figure. There, it seemed to me, the rich and the great would congregate to invite him 

to dinners, and to me, at least, who had imagination, there seemed something rather splendid in 

fancying the gentry saying, "Ah, yes--Henry J. Allen, of Wichita--the next governor of Kansas, I 

understand!" Henry indicated his feeling about the Ritz thus: The night we arrived he failed, for the 

first time in two weeks, to demand a dress rehearsal in our $17.93 uniforms from 43rd Street in 

New York. The gold braided uniforms that we saw in the corridors of the Ritz that night made us 

pause and consider many things. When we unpacked prevailed over the government of the 

missionaries. Grand Para is no doubt far distant from the mouth of the Rio Negro: but the facility of 

navigation on the Amazon, which runs like an immense canal in one direction from west to east, 

has enabled the Portuguese population to extend itself rapidly along the river. The banks of the 

Lower Maranon, from Vistoza as far as Serpa, as well as those of the Rio Negro from Fort da Bara 

to San Jose da Maravitanos, are embellished by rich cultivation, and by a great number of large 

villages and towns.  These local considerations are combined with others, suggested by the moral 

position of nations. The north-west coast of America furnishes to this day no other stable 

settlements but Russian and Spanish colonies. Before the inhabitants of the United States, in their 

progressive movement from east to west, could reach the shore between the latitude 41 and 50 

degrees, which long separated the Spanish monks and the Siberian hunters,* the latter had 

established themselves south of the Columbia River. (* The hunters connected with military posts, 

and dependent on the Russian Company, of which the principal shareholders live at Irkutsk. In 

1804 the little fortress (krepost) at the bay of Jakutal was still six hundred leagues distant from the 

most northern Mexican possessions.) Thus in New California the Franciscan missionaries, men 

estimable for their morals, and their agricultural activity, learnt with astonishment, that Greek 

priests had arrived in their neighbourhood; and that two nations, who inhabit the eastern and 

western extremities of Europe, were become neighbours on a coast of America opposite to China. 

In Guiana circumstances were very different: the Spaniards found on their frontiers those very 

Portuguese, who, by their language, and their municipal institutions, form with them one of the 

most noble remains of Roman Europe; but whom mistrust, founded on unequal strength, and too 

great proximity,

there were the little bundles just as they had come from 43rd Street. Henry tucked his away with a 

sigh, and just before he went to sleep he called across the widening spaces between sleep and 

wakening: "I suppose we might have bought that $23.78 outfit, easy enough!"  It was in the 

morning that the veneer of the Ritz began to wear off for Henry. He had pulled a bath and found it 

cold; they were conserving fuel and no hot water was allowed in the hotels converted into an often 

hostile, and always rival power.  If two nations adjacent to each other in Europe, the Spaniards 

and the Portuguese, have alike become neighbours in the New Continent, they are indebted for 

that circumstance to the spirit of enterprise and active courage which both displayed at the period 

of their military glory and political greatness. The Castilian language is now spoken in North and 

South America throughout an extent of more

Paris excepting Friday and Saturday nights. The English, who are naturally mean, declare that the 

French save seventy-five per cent of the use of their hot water by putting the two hot water nights 

together, as no living Frenchman ever took a bath two consecutive days. But it did not seem that 

way to Henry and me. And anyway we heard these theories later. But that morning Henry, who 

doesn't really mind a cold bath, was ready for it when he happened to look around the bathroom 

and found nine hundred leagues in length; if, however, we consider South America apart, we there 

find the Portuguese language spread over a larger space of ground, and spoken by a smaller 

number of individuals than the Castilian. It would seem as if the bond that so closely connects the 

fine languages of Camoens and Lope de Vega, had served only to separate two nations, who 

have become neighbours against their will. National hatred is not modified solely by a diversity of 

origin, of manners, and of
