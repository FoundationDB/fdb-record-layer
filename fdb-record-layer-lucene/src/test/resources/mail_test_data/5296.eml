philodendron monstera  Mr. Crapp's solicitor, when first consulted by his c=
lient, advised him not to think of prosecuting. Such a step was, he said, u=

as coming on philodendron monstera  Mr. Crapp's solicitor, when first consu=
lted by his client, advised him not to think of prosecuting. Such a step wa=
s, he said, unsatisfactory. If the thief were caught, the affair would cost=
 his prosecutor a tidy sum of money, in addition to his present loss, and a=

struggle of the _Trenton_ was almost ended. It was five o=E2=80=99clock and=
 daylight was fading as the immense war ship bore down upon the _Vandalia_.=
 When she struck the latter, all would be over.  That was a memorable scene=
. The night was coming on _
the latter; so he must necessarily wait until to-morrow.  While pausing for=
 the interview between=20

Mr. Crapp and Mr. Croak (the solicitor), will the reader ask himself, Had t=
he clerk robbed _his=20

master_ of the 50_l._ 4_s._ 1-1/2_d._ in question?  Perhaps the reader has =
a judicial mind. I hope=20

he has. Some day he may have to sit on a jury, as no doubt he has already h=
ad to do. That frame=20

of mind has enabled him, and will enable him, to discharge his important du=
ties to society as a=20

juryman in a sagacious manner. Well, then, the reader, having a judicial mi=
nd, can't exactly say.=20

The evidence is insufficient. He will wait and hear what other facts I have=
 to disclose, before he=20

gives his decision on the issue I have raised. A wise reservation.  Mr. Cra=
pp went home again=20

after his fruitless visit to the attorney's office.  He looked critically a=
nd suspiciously at his new clerk,=20

to see whether _he_ looked like a thief or not; and he did many other thing=
s, which, as they do not=20

touch the issue just raised, or that raised by the question at the head of =
this narrative, the reader=20

need not ask me to relate.  Mr. Crapp, it may, however, be as well to say, =
was impatient for the=20

capture of the thief. He reasoned much and seriously with himself on the su=
bject, and came to the=20

conclusion that, if he delayed all action in the matter until the morning, =
he might be neglecting his=20

duty to society at large. The culprit might escape in the course of that ve=
ry night to America, or=20

some other sanctuary for crime. Too much time had already been given him fo=
r defeating the=20

pursuit of British justice. The police ought to be instructed at once. Yes,=
 he would go to the nearest=20

station-house and inform the police. He did so. The inspector on duty intro=
duced him to Mr.=20

Sergeant Downey, and that expert thief-catcher and mystery-prober took from=
 Mr. Crapp a full,=20

true, and particular account of the matter--as far as the prosecutor could =
relate it.  Sergeant=20

Downey had not much doubt about catching the offender. The young man had th=
e good or ill=20

fortune to possess a marked and individualised countenance and gait. The of=
fence was, in all=20

probability, his first crime. The officer did not think the thief had left =
the country; nor had he, as the=20

next incidents will show.  That night a row took place in one of the haunts=
 of pleasure and vice at=20

the West End of the metropolis. A robbery was committed upon a young convey=
ed to the vessel.=20

The scores on the land were desperate, but the _Vandalia=E2=80=99s_ doom wa=
s sealed.  Finally, they=20

resolved on bolder efforts than had hitherto been made. Three natives faste=
ned a cord to their=20

bodies, and, passing around the side of the bay a quarter of a mile above t=
he wrecked war ship,=20

endeavored to take advantage of the powerful current setting toward the sho=
re, and so reach the=20

vessel. Powerful swimmers as they were, they were hurled to the beach witho=
ut being able to get=20

within one hundred yards of the vessel. Urged by their chief to try again, =
effort after effort was=20

made, but without success.  Seeing no other chance, those on the _Vandalia_=
 one by one=20

dropped into the sea, in the faint hope that they might yet reach the land =
in safety. Some=20

succeeded in reaching the wreck of the _Nipsic_, only a short distance away=
, but many were too=20

weak to draw themselves up to its deck. As they clung to the ropes, the vio=
lence of the waves, in=20

some cases, tore the clothing from their bodies.  The captain, sick and fee=
ble, was growing=20

weaker every moment. The brave Carlin stood by him endeavoring to hold him =
on, and speaking=20

words of encouragement. He had not sufficient strength left to clamber into=
 the rigging and refused=20

a life preserver, insisting that it should be given to some of the others. =
At length an immense roller=20

plunged toward the vessel, and the captain bent forward to receive the shoc=
k. A heavy machine=20

gun was torn from its fastening and hurled full upon the captain. His body =
passed overboard and=20

was never more seen.  [Illustration: THE BOW OF THE SUNKEN VANDALIA.]  One =
by one others=20



of the officers were beaten from the deck. The suffering was not only with =
those on the vessel. The=20

brave fellows who labored on the shore and in the surf were cut and bruised=
 by flying sand and the=20

floating fragments. Exposure to the sea water was making them stiff and sor=
e. The natives sought=20

occasional shelter and rest behind an up-turned boat or the masses of drift=
, and then returned to=20

the battle.  Finally, as by common consent, nearly all of those left in the=
 rigging dropped into the=20

sea. It was an easy matter to reach the _Nipsic_, and a few succeeded in cl=
ambering to her deck;=20

but many were too weak and exhausted to hold on long enough to receive assi=
stance from their=20

comrades, and too far off to be reached by the natives.  By three o=E2=80=
=99clock the hull of the=20


_
from the country in one of the night-houses of the Haymarket, during a squa=
bble between some=20

"social evils" and fast men who had there congregated. The police, on being=
 called in, seized two=20

men on suspicion of having perpetrated the offence. One of them next mornin=
g was liberated by=20

the sitting magistrate. His pocket-book, his card-case, and his own explana=
tions, warranted his=20

declaration that he was "a gentleman," and innocent of the robbery. Another=
, and a young man,=20

was not so fortunate. Having, he said, the fear of the reporter and the new=
spapers before his eyes;=20

being, he added, unwilling to disgrace his respectable friends; and being w=
ithal sure to lose his=20

situation if it transpired that he had spent an evening in such disreputabl=
e society,--he refused to=20

give his name and address. The victim of the affray could not identify the =
reticent person as the=20

thief, and was ready to admit the reasonableness of his excuse for secrecy;=
 but the magistrate=20

thought the police ought to know something more than they did about him bef=
ore he was set at=20

large. "It was," the learned gentleman said, "very strange that a young man=
 should have about=20

him, in such a place, in bank-notes and gold, about three-and-twenty pounds=
." Notwithstanding his=20

appeals and protestations, and in despite the air of injured innocence he p=
ut on, and although the=20

police knew nothing to his disadvantage except his presence at the scene of=
 the robbery and the=20

possession of this money, he was remanded, in order that further inquiries =
might be made about=20

him.  Sergeant Downey paid a visit to the house of detention, and was allow=
ed to see the reticent=20

prisoner. The sergeant asked him if his name was not Thinshanks? The prison=
er said, "No, it few=20

men were still in the rigging, lying exhausted on the small platforms or cl=
inging to the rat-lines or=20

yards with the desperation of dying men, expecting every moment to be their=
 last. Their arms and=20

limbs were bruised and swollen and cut by holding on the rough ropes. For t=
wenty-four hours they=20

had been without food, and cold and exposure were doing their work. At this=
 moment the rear of=20

the _Nipsic_ swung to the sea, so that but fifty yards separated the two ve=
ssels. A successful=20

effort was made to stretch a line between the two; but before all in the fo=
re-rigging could be=20

rescued, the line parted and could not be replaced.  Meanwhile the _Trenton=
_, without steam or=20

rudder, lay with her head to the wind, while volumes of water dashed throug=
h the hawse-pipes and=20

flooded the engine room. Had the vessel gone down suddenly, none below coul=
d have escaped.=20

They stood at their posts till waist deep in the water and the fires were e=
xtinct. The berth-deck was=20

flooded. Lieut. Allen and a portion of the men made repeated efforts to clo=
se the hawse-pipes, but=20

the force of the waves tore away every plug. Still they labored on, far ben=
eath the decks,=20

momentarily expecting the last.  The admiral and his officers stood on the =
bridge directing the=20

movements of the vessel. When almost on the eastern shoals a bold coup was =
suggested by=20

Lieut. Brown. Every man was ordered into the port-rigging, and the compact =
mass of bodies was=20

used as a sail. The vessel was brought into the center of the bay again. Th=
en she commenced to=20

drift back toward the _Olga_, which had been holding up in the gale more su=
ccessfully than any of=20

the other vessels. The stars and stripes were flung to the breeze. If she w=
ere doomed, she would=20

go down=20


_
head in token of doubt about the truthfulness of that denial, and grinned s=
ardonically. He went=20

direct from the house of detention to the abode of Mr. Crapp. Both afterwar=
ds visited the=20

temporary prison. The plausible sufferer was at once identified by the trad=
esman as his=20

absconded clerk. Mr. Thinshanks, although sullen and as reticent as colors.=
 The _Olga_=20

endeavored to steam out of the way, but her bow struck the starboard quarte=
r of the flagship,=20

shivering the heavy timbers, carrying away several boats, and throwing the =
flag to the deck. Again=20

it was flung from the mast-head. The _Olga_ reached the mud-flat on the eas=
t side of the harbor.=20

Not a life was lost, and a few weeks=20
