ammocks. These bats had long tails, like the Molosses: I _
fastened to both sides of the plow beam and standard.  During an examinatio=
n of the 1838 plow it=20

occurred to me that there was no indication of an attachment of a handle on=
 the landside in the=20

same manner as on the furrow side. The position and attachment of the handl=
e in figure 7 is=20

clearly indicated by the remains of a wooden pin in the side of the plow be=
am near the rear end=20

and by the large iron staple, in the side of the standard, which must have =
held the tapered lower=20

end of the handle. Figure 8 is a sketch showing this handle in position. Th=
e landside view of this=20

plow in figure 9 shows that the pin did not extend through the beam nor are=
 there marks on the=20

standard to indicate the position of a staple like that on the furrow side.=
 The four holes=20

approximately in line on the standard and beam show where a piece of sheet =
metal had been=20

nailed to hold the beam and standard in about the right position. The outli=
ne of the sheet metal can=20

be seen on the side of the beam. This was removed at the time this examinat=
ion was made.  How=20

was the landside handle attached? W. E. Bridges of the National Museum sugg=
ests that it might=20

have been attached to the lower side of the standard and the rear end of th=
e plow beam. This=20

seems, beyond doubt, to be correct. The wood has deteriorated considerably =
over the years and=20

the joints are loose, but, within the limits of the existing structure, the=
 plow beam can easily be set=20

in such a position that its sloping rear end lines up with the slope of the=
 underside of the standard.=20

Furthermore, a long bolt runs from the upper part of the moldboard through =
the standard and=20

projects quite far beyond its lower surface, as can be seen in figure 7. Th=
e end of the bolt is=20

threaded only part way and it has been necessary to put a cylindrical metal=
 spacer on it in order to=20

draw up the nut snugly. This long bolt must originally have passed through =
the lower end of the=20

handle, which, in turn, was fastened to the end of the plow beam by a tenon=
 on the end of the=20

beam, now broken off, passing through a mortise in the handle. This was the=
 common method of=20

fastening the handle to the beam. The square hole in the plow's iron landsi=
de (fig. 7), which at first=20

might seem meant for another bolt passing through the lower end of the hand=
le at right angles to=20

the long bolt, seems too close to the other bolt and to the edges of the ha=
ndle. It may simply be a=20

first try for the bolt through the bottom of the standard. In this manner t=
he handle would have been=20

strongly attached to the plow frame and, at the same they rarely attack men=
. I arrived at the boat=20

out of breath, and related my adventure to the Indians. They appeared very =
little interested by my=20

story; yet, after having loaded our guns, they accompanied us to the ceiba =
beneath which the=20

jaguar had lain. He was there no longer, and it would have been imprudent t=
o have pursued him=20

into the forest, where we must have dispersed, or advanced in single file, =
amidst the intertwining=20

lianas.  In the evening we passed the mouth of the Cano del Manati, thus na=
med on account of the=20

immense quantity of manatees caught there every year. This herbivorous anim=
al of the cetaceous=20

family, is called by the Indians apcia and avia,* and it attains here gener=
ally ten or twelve feet in=20

length. (* The first of these words belongs to the Tamanac language, and th=
e second to the=20

Ottomac. Father Gili proves, in opposition to Oviedo, that manati (fish wit=
h hands) is not Spanish,=20

but belongs to the languages of Hayti (St. Domingo) and the Maypures. I bel=
ieve also that,=20

according to the genius of the Spanish tongue, the animal would have been c=
alled manudo or=20

manon, but not manati.) It usually weighs from five hundred to eight hundre=
d pounds, but it is=20

asserted that one has been taken of eight thousand pounds weight. The manat=
ee abounds in the=20

Orinoco below the cataracts, in the Rio Meta, and in the Apure, between the=
 two islands of=20

Carizales and Conserva. We found no vestiges of nails on the external surfa=
ce or the edges of the=20



fins, which are quite smooth; but little rudiments of nails appear at the t=
hird phalanx, when the skin=20

of the fins is taken off. We dissected one of these animals, which was nine=
 feet long, at Carichana,=20

a Mission of the Orinoco. The upper lip was four inches longer than the low=
er one. It was covered=20

with a very fine skin, and served as a proboscis. The inside of the mouth, =
which has a sensible=20

warmth in an animal newly killed, presented a very singular conformation. T=
he tongue was almost=20

motionless; but in front of the tongue there was a fleshy excrescence in ea=
ch jaw, and a cavity=20

lined with a very hard skin, into which the excrescence fitted. The manatee=
 eats such quantities of=20

grass, that we have found its stomach, which is divided into several caviti=
es, and its intestines,=20

(one hundred and eight feet long,) filled with it. On opening the animal at=
 the back, we were struck=20

with the magnitude, form, and situation of its lungs. They have very large =
cells, and resemble=20

immense swimming-bladders. They are three feet long. Filled with air, they =
have a bulk of more=20

than a=20

have materially helped to make it rigid by forming one side of a triangular=
 structure. Figures 8 and=20

10 show what I believe to be the correct reconstruction of the 1838 Deere p=
low along the lines just=20

described and, therefore, the probable appearance of the 1837 plow.  [Illus=
tration: Figure 10.--

RECONSTRUCTION OF DEERE'S 1838 PLOW, left side, showing how left handle is =
believed to=20

have been attached. (_Smithsonian photo 42637_.)]  It should also be noted =
that it was general=20

practice in making fixed moldboard plows to have the plow beam, standard, h=
andle, and landside=20

(or sharebeam, on the old plows) in the same plane. Symmetrical handles bra=
nching from both=20

sides of the beam are found on cultivators, shovel plows, middle busters, a=
nd sidehill plows where=20

the moldboard is turned alternately to each side.   IN SUMMARY--  The exist=
ing evidence, I=20

believe, indicates that:  1. The successful prairie plow with a smooth one-=
piece moldboard and=20

steel share was basically Deere's idea.  2. The moldboards of practically a=
ll of his plows, from=20

1837 and for about 15 years, were made of wrought iron rather than steel.  =
3. The success of his=20

plows in the prairie soils depended on a steel share which held a sharp edg=
e and a highly polished=20

moldboard to which the sticky soils could not cling.  4. The importance att=
ached to the steel share=20

led to the plows being identified as steel plows.  5. The correct reconstru=
ction of the 1838 plow,=20

and, by inference, the 1837 plow, is shown in figures 8 and 10, previous re=
constructions being=20

wrong primarily in the position and attachment of the handles.  6. The Muse=
um's John Deere plow=20

(Cat. No. F1111), shown in figures 7 and 9, is a very early specimen, on th=
e basis of a comparison=20

of it with Deere such considerable receptacles for air, the manatee comes s=
o often to the surface=20

of the water to breathe. Its flesh is very savoury, though, from what preju=
dice I know not, it is=20

considered unwholesome and apt to produce fever. It appeared to me to resem=
ble pork rather=20

than beef. It is most esteemed by the Guamos and the Ottomacs; and these tw=
o nations are=20

particularly expert in catching the manatee. Its flesh, when salted and dri=
ed in the sun, can be=20

preserved a whole year; and, as the clergy regard this mammiferous animal a=
s a fish, it is much=20

sought during Lent. The vital principal is singularly strong in the manatee=
; it is tied after being=20

harpooned, but is not killed till it has been taken into the canoe. This is=
 effected, when the animal=20

is very large, in the middle of the river, by filling the canoe two-thirds =
with water, sliding it under the=20

animal, and then baling out the water by means of a calabash. This fishery =
is most easy after great=20

inundations, when the manatee has passed from the great rivers into the lak=
es and surrounding=20

marshes, and the waters diminish rapidly. At the period when the Jesuits go=
verned the Missions of=20

the Lower Orinoco, they assembled every year at Cabruta, below the mouth of=
 the Apure, to have=20

a grand fishing for manatees, with the Indians of their Missions, at the fo=
ot of the mountain now=20

called El Capuchino. The fat of the animal, known by the name of manatee-bu=
tter (manteca de=20

manati,) is used for lamps in the churches; and is also employed in prepari=
ng food. It has not the=20

fetid smell of whale-oil, or that of the other cetaceous animals which spou=
t water. The hide of the=20

manati, which is more than an inch and a half thick, is cut into slips, and=
 serves, like thongs of ox-

leather,=20
