philodendron monstera      "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the Po=

you were the man I wanted. Come, let us see what you will do for me."  "Eve=
rything that your eminence may please to command me," was _
_Genesis_ i. 26, translated in the orthodox Biblical version thus:     "And=
 God [Elohim] said, 'Let us=20

make man in our own image, after     our likeness.' " Here is a distinct ad=
mission of the fact that=20

"Elohim" is _not_ a "plural of excellence," but a plural noun     denoting =
more than one being.(387)=20

What, then, is the proper translation of "Elohim," and to whom is     it re=
ferable? "Elohim" is not=20

only a plural, but a _feminine     plural_! And yet the translators of the =
_Bible_ have rendered it=20

by a _masculine singular_! Elohim is the plural of the feminine     noun El=
-h, for the final letter, -h,=20

marks the gender. It,     however, instead of forming the plural in -oth, t=
akes the usual=20

termination of the masculine plural, which is -im.      Although in the gre=
at majority of cases the=20

nouns of both genders     take the terminations appropriated to them respec=
tively, there are     yet=20

many masculines which form the plural in -oth, as well as     feminine whic=
h form it in -im while=20

some nouns of each gender take     alternately both. It must be observed, h=
owever, that the=20

termination of the plural does not affect its gender, which     remains the=
 same as in the singular....=20

To find the real meaning of the symbolism involved in this word     Elohim =
we must go to that key=20

of Jewish Esoteric Doctrine, the     little-known and less-understood _Kaba=
lah_. There we shall=20

find     that this word represents two united masculine and feminine     Po=
tencies, co-equal and co-

eternal, conjoined in everlasting union     for the maintenance of the Univ=
erse--the great Father=20

and Mother of     Nature, into whom the Eternal One conforms himself before=
 the     Universe can=20

subsist. For the teaching of the _Kabalah_ is that     before the Deity con=
formed himself thus--

_i.e._ as male and     female--the Worlds of the Universe could not subsist=
; or in the     words of=20

_Genesis_, that "the earth was formless and void." Thus,     then, is the c=
onformation of the=20

Elohim, the end of the Formless     and the Void and the Darkness, for only=
 after that conformation=20

can the _Ruach Elohim_--the "Spirit of the Elohim"--vibrate upon the     co=
untenance of the=20

Waters. But this is a very small part of the     information which the Init=
iate can derive from the=20

_Kabalah_     concerning this word _Elohim_.   Attention must here be calle=
d to the confusion--if=20

not worse--which reigns in the Western interpretations of the _Kabalah_. Th=
e Eternal _One_ is=20

said to conform himself into two: the Great Father and Mother of Nature. To=
 begin with, it is a=20

horribly anthropomorphic conception to apply terms implying sexual distinct=
ion to the earliest and=20

first differentiations of the One. And it is even more erroneous to identif=
y these first differentiations-

-the Purusha and Prakriti of Indian Philosophy--with the Elohim, the creati=
ve powers here spoken=20

of; and to ascribe to these (to our intellects) unimaginable abstractions, =
the formation and=20

construction of this visible world, full of pain, sin, and sorrow. In truth=
, the "creation by the Elohim"=20

spoken of here is but a much later "creation," and the Elohim far from bein=
g supreme, or even=20

exalted powers in Nature, are only lower Angels. This was the teaching of t=
he Gnostics, the most=20

philosophical of all the early Christian Churches. They taught that the imp=
erfections of the world=20

were due to the imperfection of its Architects or Builders--the imperfect, =
and therefore inferior,=20

Angels. The Hebrew Elohim correspond to the Prajapati of the Hindus, and it=
 is shown elsewhere=20

from the Esoteric interpretation of the Puranas that the Prajapati were the=
 fashioners of man's=20

material and astral form _only_: that they could not give him intelligence =
or reason, and therefore=20

in symbolical language they "failed to create man." But, not to repeat what=
 the reader can find=20

elsewhere in this work, his attention needs only to be called to the fact t=
hat "creation" in this=20

passage is not the Primary Creation, and that the Elohim are not "_God_," n=
or even the higher=20

Planetary Spirits, but the Architects of this visible physical planet and o=
f man's material body, or=20



encasement.       A fundamental doctrine of the _Kabalah_ is that the gradu=
al     development of=20

the Deity from negative to positive Existence is     symbolized by the grad=
ual development of the=20

Ten Numbers of the     denary scale of numeration, from the Zero, through t=
he Unity, into     the=20

Plurality. This is the doctrine of the Sephiroth, or     Emanations.      F=
or the inward and concealed=20

Negative Form concentrates a centre     which is the primal Unity. But the =
Unity is one and=20

indivisible:     it can neither be increased by multiplication nor decrease=
d by     division, for 1 x 1 =3D=20

1, and no more; and 1 / 1 =3D 1, and no less.     And it is this changeless=
ness of the Unity, or Monad,=20

which makes     it a fitting type of the One and Changeless Deity. It answe=
rs thus     to the=20

Christian idea of God the Father, for as the Unity is the     parent of the=
 other numbers, so is the=20

Deity the Father of All.   The philosophical Eastern mind would never fall =
into the error which the=20

_connotation_ of these words implies. With them the "One and Changeless"--P=
arabrahman--the=20

Absolute All and One, cannot be conceived as standing in any _relation_ to =
things finite and=20

conditioned, and hence they would never use such terms as these, which in t=
heir very essence=20

imply such a relation. Do they, then, absolutely sever man from God? On the=
 contrary. They feel a=20

closer union than the Western mind has done in calling God the "Father of A=
ll," for they know that=20

in his immortal essence man _is_ himself the Changeless, Secondless One.   =
    But we have just=20

said that the Unity is one and changeless by     either multiplication or d=
ivision; how then is two,=20

the Duad,     formed? By reflection. For, unlike Zero, the Unity is partly =
    definable--that is, in its=20

positive aspect; and the definition     creates an Eikon or Eidolon of itse=
lf which, together with itself,=20

forms a Duad; and thus the number two is to a certain extent     analogous =
to the Christian idea of=20

the Son as the Second Person.     And as the Monad vibrates, and recoils in=
to the Darkness of the=20

Primary Thought, so is the Duad left point."  Anne blushed and buried her f=
ace in her hands.=20

"What am I to do?" she said, bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant.  "=
Endeavor to=20

remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the Channel, in s=
pite of Monsieur de=20

Richelieu, tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood, to br=
ing back to your majesty=20

certain jewels given by you to Buckingham."  Anne arose, full of majesty, a=
nd as if touched by a=20

spring, and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the d=
ays of her youth had=20

made her so powerful: "You are insulting me!" she said.  "I wish," continue=
d Mazarin, finishing, as=20

it were, the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut; "I wish, in =
fact, that you should=20

now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover."  "Again that=
 accusation!" cried the=20

queen. "I thought that calumny was stifled or extinct; you have spared me t=
ill now, but since you=20

speak of it, once for all, I tell you----"  "Madame, I do not ask you to te=
ll me," said Mazarin,=20

astounded by this returning courage.  "I will tell you all," replied Anne. =
"Listen: there were in truth,=20

at that epoch, four devoted hearts, four loyal spirits, four faithful sword=
s, who saved more than my=20

life--my honor----"  "Ah! you confess it!" exclaimed Mazarin.  "Is it only =
the guilty whose honor is at=20

the sport of others, sir? and cannot women be dishonored by appearances? Ye=
s, appearances=20

were against me and I was about to suffer dishonor. However, I swear I was =
not guilty, I swear it=20

by----"  The queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she co=
uld swear, and=20

taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry, a small coffer of rosewood=
 set in silver, and laying=20

it on the altar:  "I swear," she said, "by these sacred relics that Bucking=
ham was not my lover."=20

"What relics are those by which you swear?" asked Mazarin, smiling. "I am i=
ncredulous."  The=20

queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there, an=
d presented it to the=20



cardinal.  "Open, sir," she said, "and look for yourself."  Mazarin opened =
the coffer; a knife,=20

covered with rust, and two letters, one of which was stained with blood, al=
one met his gaze.=20

"What are these things?" he asked.  "What are these things?" replied Anne, =
with queen-like=20

dignity, extending toward the open coffer an arm, despite the lapse of year=
s, still beautiful. "These=20

two letters are the only ones I ever wrote to him. This knife is the knife =
with which Felton stabbed=20

him. Read the letters and see if I have lied or spoken the truth."  But Maz=
arin, notwithstanding this=20

permission, instead of reading the letters, took the knife which the dying =
Buckingham had=20

snatched out of the wound and sent by Laporte to the queen. The blade was r=
ed, for the blood had=20

become rust; after a momentary examination during which the queen became as=
 white as the=20

cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning, he put it back into=
 the coffer with an=20

involuntary shudder.  "It is well, madame, I believe your oath."  "No, no, =
read," exclaimed the=20

queen, indignantly; "read, I command you, for I am resolved that everything=
 shall be finished to-

night and never will I recur to this subject again. Do you think," she said=
, with a ghastly smile, "that=20

I shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations?=
"  Mazarin, overcome by=20

this determination, read the two letters. In one the queen asked for the or=
naments back again.=20

This letter had been conveyed by D'Artagnan and had arrived in time. The ot=
her was that which=20

Laporte had placed in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham, warning him that=
 he was about to be=20

assassinated; that communication had arrived too late.  "It is well, madame=
," said Mazarin;=20

"nothing can gainsay such testimony."  "Sir," replied the queen, closing th=
e coffer and leaning her=20

hand upon it, "if there is anything to be said, it is that I have always be=
en ungrateful to the brave=20

men who saved me--that I have given nothing to that gallant officer, D'Arta=
gnan, you were=20

speaking of just now, but my hand to kiss and this diamond."  As she spoke =
she extended her=20

beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkl=
ed on her finger.  "It=20

appears," she resumed, "that he sold it---he sold it in order to save me an=
other time--to be able to=20

send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his danger--he sold it to Monsi=
eur des Essarts, on=20

whose finger I remarked it. I bought it from him, but it belongs to D'Artag=
nan. Give it back to him,=20

sir, and since you have such a man in your service, make him useful."  "Tha=
nk you, madame,"=20

said Mazarin. "I will profit by the advice."  "And now," added the queen, h=
er voice broken by her=20

emotion, "have you any other question to ask me?"  "Nothing,"--the cardinal=
 spoke in his most=20

conciliatory manner--"except to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicion=
s. I love you so=20

tenderly that I cannot help being jealous, even of the past."  A smile, whi=
ch was indefinable,=20

passed over the lips of the queen.  "Since you have no further interrogatio=
ns to make, leave me, I=20

beseech you," she said. "I wish, after such a scene, to be alone."  Mazarin=
 bent low before her.  "I=20

will retire, madame. Do you permit me to return?"  "Yes, to-morrow."  The c=
ardinal took the=20

queen's hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips.  Scarcely=
 had he left her when the=20

queen went into her son's room, and inquired from Laporte if the king was i=
n bed. Laporte pointed=20

to the child, who was asleep.  Anne ascended the steps side of the bed and =
softly kissed the=20

placid forehead of her son; then she retired as silently as she had come, m=
erely saying to Laporte:=20

"Try, my dear Laporte, to make the king more courteous to Monsieur le Cardi=
nal, to whom both he=20

and I are under such important obligations."     5. The Gascon and the Ital=
ian.   Meanwhile the=20

cardinal returned to his own room; and after asking Bernouin, who stood at =
the door, whether=20

anything had occurred during his absence, and being answered in the negativ=
e, he desired that he=20



might be left alone.  When he was alone he opened the door of the corridor =
and then that of the=20

ante-chamber. There D'Artagnan was asleep upon a bench.  The cardinal went =
up to him and=20

touched his shoulder. D'Artagnan started,=20


_
representative, and thus co-equal with the Positive Duad is the     Triune =
Idea, the number three,=20

co-equal and co-eternal with the     Duad in the bosom of the Unity, yet, a=
s it were, proceeding=20

therefrom in the numerical conception of its sequence.   This explanation w=
ould seem to imply that=20

Mr. Mathers is aware that this "creation" is not the truly divine or primar=
y one, since the Monad--

the first manifestation on _our_ plane of objectivity--"recoils into the Da=
rkness of the Primal=20

Thought," _i.e._, into the subjectivity of the first divine Creation.      =
 And this, again, also partly=20

answers to the Christian idea of the     Holy Ghost, and of the whole three=
 forming a Trinity in=20

unity.     This also soldier under arms.  "Here I am," said he. "Who calls =
me?"  "I," said Mazarin,=20

with his most smiling expression.  "I ask pardon of your eminence," said D'=
Artagnan, "but I was so=20

fatigued----"  "Don't ask my pardon, monsieur," said Mazarin, "for you fati=
gued yourself in my=20

service."  D'Artagnan admired Mazarin's gracious manner. "Ah," said he, bet=
ween his teeth, "is=20

there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps?"  "Follow m=
e, monsieur," said=20

Mazarin.  "Come, come," murmured D'Artagnan, "Rochefort has kept his promis=
e, but where in the=20

devil is he?" And he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses, bu=
t there was no sign of=20

Rochefort.  "Monsieur d'Artagnan," said the cardinal, sitting down=20


_
being the smallest number which will make a plane rectilineal     figure, w=
hile two can never=20

enclose a space, being powerless and     without effect till completed by t=
he number Three. These=20

three     first numbers of the decimal scale the Qabalists call by the name=
s     of Kether, the Crown,=20

Chokmah, Wisdom, and Binah, Understanding;     and they furthermore associa=
te with them these=20

divine names: with     the Unity, Eheich, "I exist;" with the Duad, Yah; an=
d with the     Triad, Elohim;=20

they especially also call the Duad, Abba--the     Father, and the Triad, Ai=
ma--the Mother, whose=20

eternal conjunction     is symbolized in the word Elohim.      But what esp=
ecially strikes the student=20

of the _Kabalah_ is "you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorab=
le man."=20

"Possibly," thought D'Artagnan, "but he has taken a long time to let me kno=
w his thoughts;"=20

nevertheless, he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for Mazarin's compli=
ment.  "Well,"=20

continued Mazarin, "the time has come to put to use your talents and your v=
alor."  There was a=20

sudden gleam of joy in the officer's eyes, which vanished immediately, for =
he knew nothing of=20

Mazarin's purpose.  "Order, my lord," he said; "I am ready to obey your emi=
nence."  "Monsieur=20

d'Artagnan," continued the cardinal, "you performed sundry superb exploits =
in the last reign."=20

"Your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor. It is true=
 I fought with=20


_
malicious persistency with which the translators of the _Bible_     have je=
alously crowded out of=20

sight and suppressed every reference     to the feminine form of the Deity.=
 They have, as we have=20

just     seen, translated the feminine plural "Elohim,"  "I don't speak of =
your warlike exploits,=20

monsieur," said Mazarin; "although they gained you much reputation, they we=
re surpassed by=20

others."  D'Artagnan pretended astonishment.  "Well, you do not reply?" res=
umed Mazarin.  "I am=20

waiting, my lord, till you=20


_
singular, "God." But they have done more than this: they have     carefully=
 hidden the fact that the=20

word Ruach--the "Spirit"--is     feminine, and that consequently the Holy G=
host of the _New=20

Testament_ is a feminine Potency. How many Christians are     cognizant of =
the fact that in the=20

account of the Incarnation in     _Luke_ (i.  "I speak of the adventure--Eh=
, you know well what I=20

mean."  "Alas, no, my lord!" replied D'Artagnan, surprised.  "You are discr=
eet--so much the better. I=20

speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen, of the ornaments, of the jo=
urney you made with=20

three of your friends."  "Aha!" thought the Gascon; "is this a snare or not=
? Let me be on my=20
