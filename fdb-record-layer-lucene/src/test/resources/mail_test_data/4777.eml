dracaena marginata way down the stream, that Frederick, who had come she knew not how or whence, was in the boat too with some luggage which she recognised as being familiar: that another woman was there whom she to look arter number one."  It will be seen from all this that our seaman was not quite so much at home on the prairie as on the sea.  Indeed, if the expression be permissible, he was very much at dracaena marginata way down the stream, that Frederick, who had come she knew not how or whence, was in the boat too with some luggage which she recognised as being familiar: that another woman was there whom she to look arter number one."

warned all the people at the inn the moment we arrived. We told them that I was travelling with a 

sick daughter who had become crazed through the death of her lover, and believed herself--like 

most crazed persons do--to be persecuted and oppressed. You have seen the result. They pitied 

you. Even the serving-maids smiled. It would have been wiser to remain silent."  Whereupon he 

handed her into the barouche with loving care, a crowd of sympathetic onlookers gazing with 

obvious compassion on the poor crazed lady and her sorely tried father.  After this episode 

Yvonne gave up the struggle.  No one but God could help her, if He chose to perform a miracle. 

V  The rest of the journey was accomplished in silence. Yvonne gazed, unseeing, through the 

carriage window as the barouche rattled on the cobble-stones of the streets of Bristol. She 

marvelled at the number of people who went gaily by along the streets, unheeding, unknowing  "I 

make no manner o' doubt you're right, lad, but I've got my sea-legs on now, so to speak; leastwise 

I've got used to ridin' in the trip out here, as well as used to steerin' wi' the tiller-ropes in front, 

which seems to me right in the teeth o' natur', though I couldn't see how it could well be otherwise. 

But I confess that my chief difficulty is the ordnance, for it interferes a good deal wi' the steerin'. 

Hows'ever--`never ventur' never win,' you know.  I never expected to take up a noo purfession 

without some trouble."  As he spoke, the seaman's horse--a large brown chestnut--put its foot in a 

hole, and plunged forward with great violence, barely escaping a fall.  "Hold on!" shouted Archie in 

alarm.  "Hold on it is!" sang out the sailor in reply.  And hold on it was, for he had the chestnut 

round the neck with both arms.  Indeed he was sitting, or lying, on its neck altogether.  "It ain't an 

easy job," he gasped, while 


_
the greatest depths of misery to which any human being could sink had been probed by the 

unfortunate young girl who wide-eyed, mute and broken-hearted gazed out upon the busy world 

without.  Portishead was reached just when the grey light of day turned to a gloomy twilight. 

Yvonne unresisting, insentient, went whither she was bidden to go. Better that, than to feel Martin-

Roget's coercive grip on her arm, or to hear her father's curt words of command.  She walked 

along the pier and anon stepped into a boat, hardly knowing what she was doing: the twilight was 

welcome to her, for it hid much from her view and her eyes--hot with unshed tears--ached for the 

restful gloom. She realised that the boat was being rowed along for some little saddle, "when a 

fellow gets hove on to the bowsprit this way, to git fairly back on the main-deck again.  But a 

Jenkins never was beaten in fair fight.  That's all right.  Now then, Archie, you're an obleegin' cove. 

Do git down an' pick up the gun for me.  You see, if I git down it's a tryin' job to git up again--the 

side o' this here craft bein' so steep an' so high out o' the water.  Thank'ee; why, boy, you jump 

down an' up like a powder-monkey.  It ain't broke, is it?"  "No.  It seems all right," answered the 

boy, as he handed the gun to its owner.  "But if you let it go like that often, it won't be much worth 

when the run's over."  "Let it go, boy?" repeated the sailor.  "It was either let it or myself go, an'
