more in length than in the other dimensions. They are usually straight in _=
direction_, though not=20

infrequently curved, and they may even be zig-zag, especially where the ski=

_edges_ of an incised wound are linear, and show no signs of contusion. The=
y are either inverted=20

or everted and the edges and sides of the wound are retracted. The eversion=
 of the skin is due to=20

its elasticity, but in some regions of the body, _e.g._, in the scrotum, et=
c., the skin is inverted=20

owing to the contraction of the muscle fibres immediately beneath. The gapi=

to the retraction of the divided muscles and fibrous structures. It varies =
according as the muscles=20
