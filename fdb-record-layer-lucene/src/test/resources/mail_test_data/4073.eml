between the two,=20

whipping them on their naked backs for such a time, that for two weeks thei=
r clothes stuck to their=20

backs on the lacerated flesh.  To ease the soreness, Willie would steal gre=
ase from the house and=20

together they would slip into the barn and grease each other's backs.  As t=
o plantation life, Dorsey=20

said that the slaves lived in quarters especially built for them on the pla=
ntation. They would leave=20

for the fields at "sun up" and remain until "sun-down," stopping only for a=
 meal which they took=20

along with them.  Instead of having an overseer they had what was called a =
"driver" by the name=20

of Januray[TR:?]. His duties were to get the slaves together in the morning=
 and see that they went=20

to the fields and assigned them to their tasks. He worked as the other slav=
es, though, he had more=20

priveliges. He would stop work at any time he pleased and go around to insp=
ect the work of=20

history, though their effects may in time be worked off, and they may be at=
tended by some=20

incidental good. Perhaps the greatest calamity in history were the wars of =
Napoleon, in which=20

some incidental good may nevertheless be found.  To the influences of geogr=
aphical position, soil,=20

and race is to be added, to complete the account of the physical heritage, =
the influence of climate.=20

But in the case of the British Islands we must speak not of climate, but of=
 climates, for within the=20

compass of one small realm are climates moist and comparatively dry, warm a=
nd cold, bracing=20

and enervating, the results of special influences the range of which is lim=
ited. Civilized man to a=20

great extent makes a climate for himself; his life in the North is spent ma=
inly indoors, where=20

artificial heat replaces the sun. The idea which still haunts us, that form=
idable vigour and aptitude=20

for conquest are the appanage of Northern races, is a survival from the sta=
te in which the rigour=20


_
orders from the master were issued to him. The crops consisted of cotton, c=
orn, cane and peas,=20

which was raised in abundance.  When the slaves left the fields, they retur=
ned to their cabins and=20

after preparing and eating of their evening meal they gathered around a cab=
in to sing and moan=20

songs seasoned with African melody. Then to the tune of an old fiddle they =
danced a dance called=20

the "Green Corn Dance" and "Cut the Pigeon wing." Sometimes the young men o=
n the plantation=20

would slip away to hardened the destined conquerors of the Roman Empire. Th=
e stoves of St.=20

Petersburg are as enervating as the sun of Naples, and in the struggle betw=
een the Northern and=20

Southern States of America not the least vigorous soldiers were those who c=
ame from Louisiana.=20

In the barbarous state the action of a Northern climate as a force of natur=
al selection must be=20

tremendous. Of the races which peopled the British Islands the most importa=
nt had already=20

undergone that action in their original abodes.=20
