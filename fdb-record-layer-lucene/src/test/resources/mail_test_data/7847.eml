philodendron monstera  Paul drew a roll of bills from his pocket, and proce=

had a considerable amount left.  "You are getting rich, Paul," he said.  "I=
 am not rich yet," answered Paul, "but I mean to be some time if I can acco=
mplish it by industry and attention to business."  "You'll be sure to succe=
ed," said George Barry. "You're just the right sort. Good-by, old fellow. W=

n that the six or seven hundred miles between them and their country will b=
