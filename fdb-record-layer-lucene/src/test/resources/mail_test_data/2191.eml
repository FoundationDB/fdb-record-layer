dracaena marginata the big stone in his mighty arms, and deposit it in its =

mule attached found it impossible to pull it out to the tunnel mouth, Koku =

"They never came out of the front entrance of the tunnel," said Tom. "Of th=
at I'm positive."  But=20

there was no way of proving his assertion.  The third blast, while not as s=
uccessful as the second=20

in the amount of rock loosened, was better than the first, and made a big a=
dvance in the tunnel=20

progress. Tom was beginning to understand the nature of the mountain into w=
hich the big shaft=20

was being driven and he learned how better to apply the force of his explos=
ive.  That was the work=20

which he had charge of--the placing of the giant powder so it would do the =
most effective work.=20

Then, when the fumes from the blast had cleared away, in would surge the wo=
rkmen to clear away=20

the debris.  Under the direction of Mr. Swift, left at Shopton to oversee t=
he manufacture of the=20

explosive, new shipments came on promptly to Lima, and were brought out to =
the tunnel on the=20

backs of mules, or in the case of small quantities, on the llamas. But the =
latter brutes will not carry=20

a heavy load, their anger against the Abenakis!  Bands of stout colonists w=
ere sent against them,=20

eager for vengeance and showing no mercy, and as a result the chiefs of the=
 Abenakis at length=20

decided that it would be safer for them to cross the border and set up thei=
r wigwams in Canada.=20

From Canada they could raid New England as usual.  But, to their surprise, =
they were by no=20

means heartily welcomed by the French.  Canadians well knew by this time th=
e treacherous nature=20

of the Indian.  Guns and food were given them, and a smiling face hid the G=
overnor's real=20

embarrassment.  Fortunate for him if that were to be his only embarrassment=
!  Although=20

repeatedly foiled, the people of both New and Old England again plotted on =
a large scale the=20

destruction of French power in Canada, Acadia, and Newfoundland.  One day a=
 ship reached=20

Quebec with tidings that an English army was on its way to join with two ot=
her forces in an attack=20

upon Quebec.  The report was true, but certain accidents occurred=20


_
overburdened, whereas one has yet to find a mule's limit.  After his first =
success in getting the=20

natives to take a more active interest in the gathering of the cinchona bar=
k, Mr. Damon found it=20

rather easy, for the story of Tom's electric rifle and how season.  In the =
following year (1709),=20

however, they fell upon Port Royal.  The English intention was to sail on t=
o Quebec, but the=20

danger of being caught in the ice prevented them, and Nicholson appearing b=
efore {159} the=20

Acadian capital, called upon the=20


_
killed the mad dog spread among the tribes, and Mr. Damon had but to announ=
ce that the=20

"lightning shooter," as Tom was called, was a friend of the drug concern to=
 bring about the desired=20

results. Mr. Damon, by paying a sort of bribe, disguised under the Subercas=
e to surrender.  Port=20

Royal had not expected an attack; both powder and provisions were low, but =
Subercase was not a=20

man to yield without firing a shot.  So gallant a resistance did he offer, =
although his garrison was in=20

a half-starved state,=20


_
help of Peruvian officials so he had no trouble on that score.  Koku was in=
 his element. He liked a=20

wild life and Peru was much more like the country of giants where Tom had f=
ound him, than any=20

place the big man had since visited. Koku had great strength and wanted to =
use it, and after a=20

week or so of idleness he persuaded Tom to let him go in the tunnel to work=
.  The giant was made=20

a sort of foreman he could fight no more, Nicholson granted him the honours=
 of war. With the fleur-

de-lys flying in the icy breeze, with the roll of drums and the sound of th=
e trumpet, the last of the=20

shattered band of Frenchmen sailed out of Port Royal, which was to be Port =
Royal no more.  In=20

honour of Queen Anne, Nicholson rechristened the place Annapolis Royal, and=
 thereafter it was=20

held by the Queen's successors on=20


_
great friends. The only trouble with Koku was that he would do a thing hims=
elf instead of letting his=20

men do it, as, of course, all proper foremen should do. If the giant saw tw=
o or three of the Indians=20

trying to lift a big rock into the little dump cars, and failing because of=
 its great  Acadia now being=20

English and garrisoned by the colonists, it remained to deal a deadly blow =
at Quebec.  Up to this=20

time the chief difficulty had been to procure sufficient soldiers from Engl=
and, for during all the=20

years since the outbreak of Queen Anne's war England had been drained of=20
