some slender pillar of incense-smoke, straight into the palace temple of Go=
d--and, as he says,=20

with a meaning which our version obscures, "My cry before Him came into His=
 ears." The prayer=20

that springs from a living consciousness of being in God's presence, even w=
hen nearest to=20

perishing, is the prayer that He hears. The cry is a poor, thin, solitary v=
oice, unheard on earth,=20

though shrill enough to rise to heaven; the answer shakes creation. One man=
 in his extremity can=20

put in motion all the magnificence of God. Overwhelming is the contrast bet=
ween the cause and=20

the effect. And marvellous as the greatness, so also is the swiftness of th=
e answer. A moment=20

suffices--and then! Even whilst he cries, the rocking earth and the quiveri=
ng foundations of the hills=20

are conscious that the Lord comes from afar for his help. The majestic self=
-revelation of God as=20

the deliverer has for its occasion the psalmist's cry of distress, and for =
its issue, "He drew me out=20

of many waters." All the splendour flames out because a poor man prays, and=
 all the upheaval of=20

earth and the artillery of heaven has simply this for its end, that a poor =
man may be delivered. The=20

paradox of prayer never found a more bold expression than in this triumphan=
t utterance, of the=20

insignificant occasion for, and the equally insignificant result sought by,=
 the exercise of the energy=20

of Omnipotence.  The Divine deliverance is set forth under the familiar ima=
ge of the coming of God=20

in a tempest. Before it bursts, and simultaneous with the prayer, the "eart=
h rocks and quivers," the=20

sunless "pillars of the hills reel and rock to and fro," as if conscious of=
 the gathering wrath which=20

begins to flame far off in the highest heavens. There has been no forth-put=
ting yet of the Divine=20

power. It is but accumulating its fiery energy, and already the solid frame=
work of the world=20

trembles, anticipating the coming crash. The firmest things shake, the loft=
iest bow before His=20

wrath. "There went up smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth =
devoured; coals were=20

kindled by it." This kindling anger, expressed by these tremendous metaphor=
s, is conceived of as=20

the preparation in "His temple" for the earthly manifestation of delivering=
 vengeance. It is like some=20

distant thunder-cloud which grows on the horizon into ominous blackness, an=
d seems to be filling=20

its ashen-coloured depths with store of lightnings. Then the feel conscious=
 that, somehow or other,=20

though I had often been in America before, this time it was to be to me a n=
ewer world than ever.=20

"Are you going alone?" said Grandon; for I had not finished my sentence.  "=
No," I said; and I=20

guessed who my companion was to be, though no words had been exchanged betw=
een us.  "Who=20

IS going with you?" he asked, wonderingly, for my manner struck him, and I =
scarcely heard his=20

question, so wrapt at that instance seemed all my faculties. I think I fell=
 asleep and dreamt, but I=20

can't recall exactly what I seemed to see. Grandon was shaking me, I though=
t, in the most=20

heartless manner, and I told him as much when I opened my eyes. The fact wa=
s, I was a little=20

knocked up with excitement; but I would not go and lie down till he promise=
d me to stand for=20

Dunderhead. Then I went to bed, and did not get up till the lamps were bein=
g lighted in Piccadilly.=20

The result of such irregular hours was that I was in bed next morning when =
Spiffy Goldtip knocked=20

at my bedroom-door. He had worked very hard in Lady Broadhem's interest, an=
d explained to me=20

the scheme which he had arranged with Bodwinkle, by means of which, at a ve=
ry considerable=20

sacrifice of my own capital, I could start Lady Broadhem and her son afresh=
 in the world, on a very=20

limited income, but devoid of encumbrances of a threatening or embarrassing=
 nature. I would far=20

rather have invested the same amount in securing a larger income to Grandon=
 and Ursula, if they=20

were ever destined to be united; but I knew that, in the first place, nothi=
ng would induce them to=20

take it from me; and in the second, that I could only even now hope to exto=
rt Lady Broadhem's=20



consent to the match by the prospect I was enabled to hold out to her of a =
period of financial=20

repose. After all, my own wants were moderate, and L15,000 a-year satisfied=
 them as well as=20

L20,000.  "We accomplished great things yesterday," said Spiffy, rubbing hi=
s hands gleefully, for=20

he had himself benefited by the settlement above alluded to. "When I showed=
 Bodwinkle that we=20

could make the Scilly boroughs a certainty, he behaved like a gentleman, an=
d our friend=20

Chundango is to go out to Bombay by the next mail, under more favourable co=
nditions than he=20

could have possibly expected. Of course I shall retire from contesting Shuf=
fleborough to the more=20

congenial atmosphere of Homburg. Heigho!" sighed Spiffy, "I have gone throu=
gh a good deal=20


_
begins to move, and, drawing nearer, pours out an avalanche of gloom seamed=
 with fire. First the=20

storm-cloud descends, hanging lower and lower in the sky. And whose foot is=
 that which is planted=20

upon its heavy mass, thick and frowning enough to be the veil of God?    "H=
e bowed the heavens,=20

and came down,    And blackness of cloud was under His feet."  Then the sud=
den rush of wind=20

which heralds the lightning breaks the awful silence:--    And He rode upon=
 a cherub, and did fly,=20

Yea, He swept along upon the wings of the wind.  The cherubs bear, as in a =
chariot, the throned=20

God, and the swift pinions of the storm bear the cherubs. But He that sits =
upon the throne, above=20

material forces and the highest creatures, is unseen. The psalmist's imagin=
ation stops at its base,=20

nor dares to gaze into that light above; and the silence is more impressive=
 than all words. Instead=20

of pagan attempts at a likeness of God, we have next painted, with equal de=
scriptive accuracy,=20

poetic force, and theological truth, the pitchy blackness which hides Him. =
In the gloom of its depths=20

He makes His "secret place" His "tent." It is "darkness of waters," that is=
, darkness from which=20

streams out the thunder-rain; it is "thick clouds of the skies;" or perhaps=
 the expression should be=20

rendered, "heavy masses of clouds." Then comes the crash of the tempest. Th=
e brightness that=20

lies closer around Him, and lives in the heart of the blackness, flames for=
th, parting the thick=20

clouds--and through the awful rent hail and coals of fire are flung down on=
 the trembling earth. The=20

grand description may be rendered in two ways: either that adopted in our v=
ersion, "At the=20

brightness that was before Him His thick clouds tear this season, and want =
to recruit."  I got rid of=20

Spiffy as soon as I had heard what he had to say, and I was so satisfied wi=
th his intelligence that I=20

determined at once to see Grandon, and to take him with me to Lady Broadhem=
's. "Grandon," I=20

said, abruptly entering his room, "I want you to come with me at once to Gr=
osvenor Square."  "Did=20

Lady Broadhem tell you to ask me?" He looked up with such a sad, wistful ga=
ze as he said this,=20

that my heart melted towards him, for I felt I had spoken roughly; so I dre=
w a chair close to him,=20

and, sitting by his side, placed my arm in his as we did in the old school-=
days.  "My dear old fellow,=20

the moment is come for you to prove your friendship by trusting me thorough=
ly. I know how rudely=20

Lady Broadhem has always behaved to you whenever you have met--I know how m=
y conduct has=20

perplexed and grieved you. Well, now, I have come to ask you to forgive us =
both."  "I have nothing=20

to forgive; but it would be an utter want of taste in me to go there unless=
 she expects me, and=20

wishes to see me, and I can hardly hope that," he said, with a forced smile=
.  For a moment I=20

doubted whether I dared to risk it, but I had placed Lady Broadhem in a pos=
ition upon which I=20

could venture a good deal, and I longed for the triumph and gratification o=
f enjoying the success of=20

my own handiwork. It would be a triumph full of alloy, but I wanted to see =
how much I could=20

achieve and--bear; so my hesitation vanished.  "I will take the responsibil=
ity on myself," I said; "and=20

believe me, I would not urge it if I was not perfectly certain that I was d=
oing what is right.=20

Remember how many times I have blindly followed your advice. I only ask you=
 this once to follow=20

mine, and=20


_
there passed hailstones and coals of fire." The former of these is the more=
 dramatic; the broken=20

construction expresses more vividly the fierce suddenness of the lightning =
blaze and of the down-

rush of the hail, and is confirmed by the repetition of the same words in t=
he same construction in=20

the next verse. That verse describes another burst of the tempest--the deep=
 roll of the thunder=20

along the skies is the voice of  The temptation was too strong, and Grandon=
 yielded; but it was=20

with a reluctant, doubtful step that he approached the door he had not this=
 year ventured to enter.=20

It was opened by Drippings, and I took the opportunity of having a little p=
rivate conversation with=20

him in the hall, in the course of which it was arranged that he should exch=
ange her ladyship's=20

service for mine, and accompany me to America: the truth is, I=20
