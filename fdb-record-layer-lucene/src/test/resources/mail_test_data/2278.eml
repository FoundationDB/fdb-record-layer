S   1. without boring them--one must have, besides talent, experience and a=
 special knack; one must possess a clear conception of one's own powers, of=
 the audience to which one is lecturing, and of the subject of one's lectur=
e. Moreover, one must be a man who knows what _
a true impression, but very often leads the mind to form a false judgment. =
In painted scenery, for=20

example, columns may appear to jut out, mutules to project, and statues to =
be standing in the=20

foreground, although the picture is of course perfectly flat. Similarly wit=
h ships, the oars when=20

under the water are straight, though to the eye they appear to be broken. T=
o the point where they=20

touch the surface of the sea they look straight, as indeed they are, but wh=
en dipped under the=20

water they emit from their bodies undulating images which come swimming up =
through the=20

naturally transparent medium to the surface of the water, and, being there =
thrown into commotion,=20

make the oars look broken.  3. Now whether this appearance is due to the im=
pact of the images,=20

or to the effusion of the rays from the eye, as the physicists hold, in eit=
her case it is obvious that=20

the vision may lead us to false impressions.  4. Since, therefore, the real=
ity may have a false=20

appearance, and since things are sometimes represented by the eyes as other=
 than they are, I=20

think it certain that diminutions or additions should be made to through th=
e doors a murmur as of=20

the sea from the lecture-theatre. In the course of thirty years I have not =
grown accustomed to this=20

feeling, and I experience it every morning. I nervously button up my coat, =
ask Nikolay unnecessary=20

questions, lose my temper.... It is just as though I were frightened; it is=
 not timidity, though, but=20

something different which I can neither describe nor find a name for.  Quit=
e unnecessarily, I look at=20

my watch and say: "Well, it's time to go in."  And we march into the room i=
n the following order:=20

foremost goes Nikolay, with the chemicals and apparatus or with a chart; af=
ter him I come; and=20

then the carthorse follows humbly, with hanging head; or, when necessary, a=
 dead body is carried=20

in first on a stretcher, followed by Nikolay, and so on. On my entrance the=
 students all stand up,=20

then they sit down, and the sound as of the sea is suddenly hushed. Stillne=
ss reigns.  I know what=20

I am going to lecture about, but I don't know how I am going to lecture, wh=
ere I am going to begin=20

or with what I am going to end. I haven't a single sentence ready in my hea=
d. But I have only to=20


_
the nature or needs of the site, but in such fashion that the buildings los=
e nothing thereby. These=20

results, however, are also attainable by flashes of genius, and not only by=
 mere science.  5.=20

Hence, the first thing to settle is the standard of symmetry, from which we=
 need not hesitate to=20

vary. Then, lay out the ground lines of the length and breadth of the work =
proposed, and when=20

once we have round the lecture-hall (it is built in the form of an amphithe=
atre) and utter the=20

stereotyped phrase, "Last lecture we stopped at..." when sentences spring u=
p from my soul in a=20

long string, and I am carried away by my own eloquence. I speak with irresi=
stible rapidity and=20

passion, and it seems as though there were no force which could check the f=
low of my words. To=20

lecture well--that is, with profit=20
