Jasmine, and the face of Miss Daisy. The ladies here, miss--for I must own =
to the truth--are not as=20

beautiful as was to be expected. Neither in their visages nor in their mann=
ers are they beautiful.=20

Sharp's the word from morn till night here, and many a time I cry. I hasn't=
 had no moment yet to=20

visit the sights, for aunt's hands are very full, and she looks most natura=
l to me to assist her, which=20

I do, as in duty bound. I'm told that there isn't much of the real London t=
o be seen from Penelope=20

Mansion, so I live in hopes that it is as beautiful as we pictured it beyon=
d these dull walls. Miss, I=20

has spoken to my aunt, and she will be very pleased to receive you three, a=
nd will put you in a=20

bedroom to the front of the house. You'll be fretted by the roar from the c=
ontinuous multitude which=20

passes these windows all day and all night, but otherwise the room is cheer=
ful, although=20

somewhat hot. Miss Primrose, I'll give you all such a welcome.       "Your =
humble and most=20

devoted friend,      "POPPY JENKINS."  This letter was received by the girl=
s while they were eating=20

their breakfast. Primrose read it aloud to her sisters, and the effect of P=
oppy's words was certainly=20

not enlivening. Jasmine was the first to recover her spirits.  "Never mind,=
" she said; "Poppy feels a=20

little dull and it is more than ever our duty to go up to London, and try a=
nd cheer her. Poor Poppy!=20

it is very wrong of her aunt not to let her go out to see the sights, and y=
ou see, Primrose, she really=20

knows no part of London yet, except Penelope Mansion. Poor Poppy! how she d=
id long to go to=20

see the wonderful city; but she was a little frivolous, and seemed only to =
want to look at the shop=20

windows and to examine the newest fashions. _We_ go to this grand, great Lo=
ndon in a different=20

spirit--we go determined to conquer, don't we, Queen Rose?"  "We go to do w=
hat seems to be our=20

duty," answered Primrose, solemnly. "Oh, Jasmine! I hope we are doing right=
--I hope, I pray that=20

God may help us."  Then a letter was written to Poppy, in which the noisy r=
oom was secured for=20

the following Thursday, and as this was Monday, the girls were too busy pac=
king to give many=20

mere thoughts to poor Poppy's somewhat melancholy epistle.     CHAPTER XVI.=
  PENELOPE=20

MANSION.   The last time in the funny little old-fashioned garden, the last=
 loving look at Jasmine's=20

carnations, the last eager chase of the Pink across the little grass-plot, =
the last farewell said to the=20

room where mother had died, to the cottage where Daisy was born, the final =
hug from all three to=20

dear old Hannah who vowed and declared that follow them to London she would=
, and stay in=20

Devonshire any longer she would not, and the girls had left Woodbine Cottag=
e.  Notwithstanding=20

all their obstinacy, and their determination to have their own way, quite a=
 bevy of friends=20

accompanied them to the railway station--Miss Martineau was there, looking =
prim and starched,=20

but with red rims round her eyes, and her lips only stern because they were=
 so firmly shut, and=20

because she was so determined not to show any emotion--Mrs. Jenkins, Poppy'=
s mother, was=20

also present; she was sending up a great bouquet of wild flowers and some e=
ggs and butter to=20

Poppy; and a lame boy, whom Jasmine had always been kind to, came hobbling =
on to the platform=20

to bid the young ladies good-bye; and Mr. Danesfield drove up on his trap a=
t the last moment in a=20

violent hurry, and pushed an envelope, which he said contained a business c=
ommunication, into=20

Primrose's hand. Last of all, just at the very end, Mrs. Ellsworthy arrived=
 panting on the scene; a=20

footman followed her, also hurrying and panting, and he put into the railwa=
y carriage a great=20

basket containing hot-house flowers, and grapes, and peaches, and then Mrs.=
 Ellsworthy kissed=20

the girls, giving Primrose and Daisy a hurried salute, but letting her lips=
 linger for a moment on=20

Jasmine's round cheek. During that brief moment two tears dropped from the =
kind little lady's=20

eyes.  It was in this manner that the girls went away.  They arrived in Lon=
don in the evening, and=20



after a surprisingly successful search for their luggage at Waterloo, manag=
ing not to lose anything,=20

got into a cab, and drove to Penelope Mansion.  Poppy's aunt boasted of the=
 pleasing name of=20

Flint, and when the girls drove up with their cab piled with luggage to the=
 door of the mansion, Mrs.=20

Flint herself came out to welcome them.  Jasmine, whose excitable temperame=
nt had been going=20

through many changes during the journey to town, had now worked herself up =
into an ardent=20

desire to see Poppy--she jumped out of the cab first of all, and, running u=
p the steps of Penelope=20

Mansion, said eagerly--  "Oh, if you Mr. McGowan, who is the candidate for =
installation as pastor=20

of this very beautiful church. The members of the council will be given an =
opportunity to question=20

Mr. McGowan after he has read to us his statement. A word of caution needs =
to be uttered: you=20

are to confine your questions to theological matters as they may affect the=
 fellowship of the=20

ministers and churches represented to-day by pastor and delegate. Mr. McGow=
an will please=20

come forward."  Mr. McGowan came forward in more ways than one. He concisel=
y stated his=20

belief in applied Christianity, and followed with a program for future work=
 in the village. His short=20

statement left the council under the spell of an embarrassed silence. But t=
he first question broke=20

the silence, and was followed by others both new and old, which were hurled=
 at the head of the=20

candidate like shots from a rapid-fire gun.  Captain Pott stood the fusilla=
de as long as his patience=20

permitted, and then retreated to the quiet of the out-of-doors, where he dr=
agged a box into the=20

shade of the building, and lit his pipe. Here Elizabeth Fox found him, when=
 she, too, felt the need=20

of a little fresh air.  "Uncle Josiah, did you ever hear anything so ridicu=
lous? Why did you come out=20

here?"  "I felt sort as if I was coming up into a reg'lar twister, and thou=
ght it would be safer to reef a=20

mite and make for ca'm waters. My head begun to whirl, and I cal'lated I'd =
best weigh anchor while=20

my soundings was good."  "But isn't it bad form for you to desert like this=
?" she asked, her big=20

eyes dancing mischievously.  "I ain't exactly deserting, I cal'late. If I'd=
 been able to pitch into that=20

crew and shake the devil out of 'em, I'd stayed on deck. But----"  "I want =
you to go back with me.=20

It's getting too funny to miss!"  "I ain't got much hankering for them offi=
cers' meeting, Beth. It=20

makes me feel like busting chairs on their heads."  "But you must go back! =
You should hear what=20

he is saying to them. Come!"  Before the seaman could obey the summons, Mis=
s Edna Splinter=20

emerged from the rear door. She hurried toward the two. Miss Splinter was o=
ne of those fine=20

spinsters which one so often finds stranded in small villages located near =
large cities. She was=20

one of the few friends of the Captain in Little River.  "It's the most disg=
usting thing I ever saw or=20

heard!" declared Miss Splinter, angrily stamping her foot.  "It's really to=
o funny for words!"=20

exclaimed Elizabeth.  "What in tarnation is he doing to them?"  "Doing to t=
hem!" flashed Miss=20

Splinter indignantly. "My word! It's what they're trying to do to him. It i=
s positively disgraceful."  The=20

seaman decided that a scene which could have such opposite effects on two o=
f his best friends=20

must at least be interesting. He knocked the tobacco from his pipe and foll=
owed them inside. As=20

he listened, his interest grew, not so much in the ecclesiastical storm of =
big words, as in the wildly=20

gesticulating clergymen. The moderator had risen and was rapping loudly for=
 order.  "Brethren!" he=20

thundered. "It is time that we recognize some of our laymen. I see Mr. Harr=
y Beaver of this church=20

asking for the floor. Mr. Beaver may speak."  "M-Mr. Ch-chairman, does M-Mr=
. Mc-McGowan b-

believe in e-ev----"  The unfortunate man blinked, backed, pumped, emitted =
a series of hissing=20

sounds like escaping steam, but remained hopelessly stuck. Those round him =
dodged his foot=20

gestures, and smiled appreciatively, while those not engaged in trying to e=
scape mutilation of=20



corns, encouragingly suggested words such as everlasting, everpresent, etc.=
, which might have=20

bearing on the subject previously under discussion. The little man spurned =
them all with vigorous=20

backings and increased hissings. At last, between a discouraged hiss and a =
triumphant sputter,=20

the awful word rolled out.  "Evolution!" he shouted, and sat down.  After t=
he laughter had subsided,=20

the moderator demanded that the candidate answer the question.  "Yes, Mr. M=
oderator."  Mr.=20

Means was on his feet in an incredibly short time for one so bulky. "Then, =
you deny here in the=20

face of these wise men, as you did before your superiors in the New York Pr=
esbytery, the creation=20

story of the Bible?"  "I did not deny it then, and I do not deny it now."  =
"Brethren, we have the right=20

to an explanation from our young brother. I was denied that privilege at th=
e time of his ordination.=20

But I consider his contradictory statements so serious a thing that I shall=
 give you the opportunity=20

that was denied me."  Elder Fox, plainly nettled by the turn affairs had ta=
ken, rose and demanded=20

the floor.  "Brother Fox!" vociferously acknowledged the moderator.  "We ha=
ve no right to carry this=20

senseless discussion further. There=20


_
Flint--may I run down to the kitchen, and find Poppy?"  "My niece will come=
 to you presently, Miss=20

Mainwaring," answered Mrs. Flint.  Somehow Mrs. Flint's calm and carefully =
modulated voice had=20

an instant effect in subduing Jasmine. The mistress of Penelope Mansion res=
embled perhaps=20

more a cushion than a flint--she was fat, round, and short, had a good-humo=
red and unruffled=20

face, and a voice which was always pitched in one key.  "We call my niece S=
arah in these=20

premises," she said; "Poppy signifies nothing whatever but a weed, untidy, =
straggling, the worry of=20

the farmers. Sarah will see to your comforts presently, young ladies. At th=
e present moment tea is=20

on the table. We tea at six o'clock precisely--we sup at nine. Will you lik=
e to go upstairs and wash=20

your hands, or will you come at once with me, and partake with the other in=
mates of the meal=20

which is now going forward?"  "I don't like her, but she seems to speak ver=
y correct English,"=20

whispered Jasmine to her sister: "I wonder, does everybody in the great cit=
y speak like that? I=20

suppose she'll do as a study in style. I must study style, mustn't I, if I'=
m to make money by=20

writing?"  This speech was tumbled into Primrose's ear with wonderful rapid=
ity, while Mrs. Flint=20

stood gently by, looking most contented and uninterested.  "Hush, Jasmine!"=
 whispered Primrose.=20

"Daisy darling, hold my hand. Thank you very much, Mrs. Flint; we will have=
 some tea now, if you=20

please, and then go at once to our room."  "Does Poppy--I mean Sarah--wait =
at the tea-table?"=20

inquired Jasmine, as their hostess led not yet been sounded--er--the note o=
f fellowship that should=20

prevail among the brethren," declared the Elder, eyeing the chairman. Very =
gently stroking his=20

side-whiskers, he continued: "We have sprung at our young friend--er--as if=
 he were before a jury,=20

condemned and found guilty of a felony. Why should we trouble him about thi=
ngs that are not=20

fundamental to our faith?"  Captain Pott muttered something under his breat=
h. Never before had=20

he known of the Elder and the city minister disagreeing.  "That is the very=
 question," expostulated=20

the moderator. "Mr. McGowan has attacked every sacred doctrine of the churc=
h, for he has said=20

what is equivalent to the statement that my ancestors were monkeys. What ot=
her interpretation=20

can be given to the doctrine of evolution? If it does not contradict every =
sacred belief of our past,=20

then I am no theologian."  The old seaman chuckled, and several shocked fac=
es were turned in=20

his direction.  "Perhaps it would help if Mr. McGowan would tell us just wh=
at he does believe in=20

regard to the book of Genesis," suggested Mr. Fox.  "It is the story of hum=
an redemption."  With a=20

nod of satisfied approval, the Elder sat down, and the moderator crumpled u=
p.  Captain Pott=20

irreverently observed to Elizabeth: "I cal'late that there Means is left fo=
r once with his sails=20

flopping, without no idea as to what his longitude is."  A little wizened-l=
ooking man smiled cordially=20

and addressed the chair, but the "chair" seemed oblivious to all about him.=
  "Should not the=20

ministry of to-day place greater emphasis on the philosophy=20


_
passage. "I hope she does--I want to see her so badly."  "Sarah's duties at=
 the present moment=20

are in the kitchen," responded Mrs. Flint, with some graciousness. "Now, yo=
ung ladies, let me=20

precede you, and introduce you to my guests. Miss Mainwaring, Miss Jasmine =
and Miss Daisy=20

Mainwaring--Mrs. Mortlock, Mrs. Dredge, Miss Slowcum. Young ladies, will yo=
u seat yourselves at=20

the table?"  Mrs. Flint moved to her place at the head of the board; the th=
ree girls dropped into=20

seats, and were stared broadly at by Miss Slowcum and Mrs. Mortlock. Mrs. D=
redge, however, did=20

not stare, but stretching out one rather plump white hand, took Daisy's wit=
hin her own and gave it=20

a little squeeze.  "Tired, pretty little dear!" she said; "tired and cold. =
Ah, I know all about the middle=20

ages?" asked the man.  "We should preach both where they affect life; neith=
er where they do not,"=20

was the quick response.  "I am an instructor in philosophy in the high scho=
ol over at Marble Point,=20

and I was led by your last reply concerning your belief in the book of Gene=
sis to believe you are=20

somewhat of a philosopher. Do you not think that philosophy will touch life=
 more quickly than=20

theology?"  "Religion is something that has outgrown both the classroom and=
 the cloister. It is the=20

anonymous religion that we must take into account in the future if the chur=
ch is to progress with=20

the needs of men."  It was the voice of the Captain who broke the silence o=
f surprise which=20

followed the unusual statement.  "I want to know!" came the seaman's=20


_
"No, she's not cold, she's hot," responded Jasmine; "this is the hottest, c=
losest room I've ever=20

been in. You are Mrs. Dredge, are you not? Please, Mrs. Dredge, can you tel=
l me how near we are=20

to the real glories of the city from here?"  "I don't know, my dear--I fanc=
y a very long way,"=20

answered Mrs. Dredge, with a sigh--this sigh was instantly taken up by Mrs.=
 whisper.  Every face=20

in the room seemed to register the same question. Mr. McGowan smiled and ex=
plained.  "By=20

anonymous religion I mean every ideal striving for the right and truth, whe=
rever it is found, and by=20

whatever name it may be known. It may be found outside the church as readil=
y as within it.=20

Wherever good is found, the church should make use of it,=20
