dracaena marginata  Throughout the summer and autumn of 1830 both the State=
 Rights and Union parties in South Carolina worked feverishly to perfect th=
eir organizations. The issue that both were making ready to meet was nothin=
g less than the election of a convention to nullify the tariff laws. Those =
upholding nullification lost no opportunity to consolidate their forces, an=

count of this tragedy, Jeanne is represented as confessing her small share =
in the wrong and pleading for mercy before Philippe le Bel: "Sire, for God'=

 guilt, without sin or shame." She demanded an investigation, and dracaena =

As the election of 1828 approached, the hope of the discontented forces cen=
tered in Jackson.=20

They did not overlook the fact that his record was that of a moderate prote=
ctionist. But the same=20

was true of many South Carolinians and Georgians, and it seemed not at all =
impossible that, as a=20

Southern man and a cotton planter, he should undergo a change of heart no l=
ess decisive than=20

that which Hayne and Calhoun had experienced. Efforts to draw him out, howe=
ver, proved not=20

very successful. Lewis saw to it that Jackson's utterances while yet he was=
 a candidate were=20

safely colorless; and the single mention of the tariff contained in the ina=
ugural address was=20

susceptible of the most varied interpretations. The annual message of 1829 =
indicated opposition to=20

protection; on the other hand, the presidential message of the next year no=
t only asserted the full=20

power of Congress to levy protective duties but declared the abandonment of=
 protection "neither to=20

be expected or desired." Gradually the antiprotectionist leaders were made =
to see that the tariff=20

was not a subject upon which the President felt keenly, and that therefore =
it was useless to look to=20

him for effective support.  Even the adroit efforts which were made to get =
from the incoming=20

executive expressions that could be interpreted as endorsements of nullific=
ation were successfully=20

fended off. For some months the President gave no outward sign of his disap=
proval. With more=20

than his usual deliberateness, Jackson studied the situation, awaiting the =
right moment to speak=20

out with the maximum of effect.  The occasion finally came on April 13, 183=
0, at a banquet held in=20

Washington in celebration of Jefferson's birthday. The Virginia patron of d=
emocracy had been=20

dead four years, and Jackson had become, more truly than any other man, his=
 successor.=20

Jacksonian democracy was, however, something very different from Jeffersoni=
an, and never was=20

the contrast more evident than on this fateful evening. During the earlier =
part of the festivities a=20

series of prearranged toasts, accompanied by short speeches, put before the=
 assemblage the=20

Jeffersonian teachings in a light highly favorable--doubtless unwarrantably=
 so--to the ultra state=20

rights theory. Then followed a number of volunteer toasts. The President wa=
s, of course, accorded=20

the honor of proposing the first--and this gave Jackson his chance. Rising =
in his place and drawing=20

himself up to his full height, he raised his right hand, looked straight at=
 Calhoun and, amid=20

breathless silence, exclaimed in that crisp, harsh tone that that during th=
ree years they had sinned=20

many times with the princesses. The right of trial by battle, for which the=
 knights first asked, had=20

been sternly denied them; there was but the rack, and after that a shameful=
 death for those who=20

had dared to bring shame upon the royal family. With the ingenuity of the M=
iddle Ages in devising=20

exquisite torments, the two young men were publicly flayed alive, cruelly m=
utilated, and tortured as=20

long as life could be kept in their miserable bodies. There were other acco=
mplices in the disgrace=20

of the princesses; these, too, when they were not of rank sufficiently high=
 to protect them, were=20

tortured, sewn up in sacks, and cast into the Seine. An unfortunate Dominic=
an monk, accused of=20

having debauched the princesses by compounding love philtres and otherwise =
exercising the=20

black art, was delivered over into the hands of the Inquisition; he was nev=
er heard of afterward.=20

The confessions of their lovers left no doubt as to the guilt of Blanche an=
d Marguerite. The former,=20

still but a girl, had been led into her evil ways by Marguerite, and pitifu=
lly owned her sin, pleading=20

for forgiveness in accents of such sincere repentance that all who heard he=
r were moved. But her=20

husband was inexorable; and she remained in prison until 1322, when Charles=
, having become=20

king, obtained a dissolution of the marriage on the ground that Mahaut had =
been his godmother=20

and that this established a spiritual relationship for which he had forgott=
en to ask a dispensation=20



when he married Blanche. Then Charles married Marie de Luxembourg, and his =
unhappy divorced=20

wife was compelled to retire to a nunnery.  It was said that in her prison =
of Chateau Gaillard she=20

had suffered violence from her jailer; it is more charitable to suppose tha=
t this is so than to=20

assume, as some do, that she was so depraved in morals as voluntarily to ab=
andon herself to=20

debauchery; and one must always remember that it was to the interest of the=
 court party to=20

represent her in colors as dark as possible. The belief in her guilt, never=
theless, cannot be=20

avoided; and even her mother gives silent proof of her belief in it, for af=
ter the disgrace of her=20

daughter, that daughter's name appears no more in the accounts of Mahaut's =
household. Blanche=20

retired to the convent of Maubuisson, where she took the veil in 1325, and =
died in the next year.=20

Under "a large white stone, much carved and decorated with roses, without a=
ny inscription, and=20

bearing a figure representing a nun," lay the body of the unhappy Blanche, =
once Queen of France=20

_
An account of the scene which is given by Isaac Hill, a member of the Kitch=
en Cabinet and an=20

eyewitness, is interesting:  A proclamation of martial law in South Carolin=
a and an order to arrest=20

Calhoun where he sat could not have come with more blinding, staggering for=
ce. All hilarity=20

ceased. The President, without adding one word in the way of speech, lifted=
 up his glass as a=20

notice that the toast was to be quaffed standing. Calhoun rose with the res=
t. His glass so trembled=20

in his hand that a little of the amber fluid trickled down the side. Jackso=
n stood silent and=20

impassive. There was no response to the toast. Calhoun waited until all sat=
 down. Then he slowly=20

and with hesitating accent offered the second volunteer toast: "The Union! =
Next to Our Liberty=20

Most Dear!" Then, after a minute's hesitation, and in a way that left doubt=
 as to whether he=20

intended it for part of the toast or for the preface to a speech, he added:=
 "May we all remember=20

that it can only be preserved by respecting the rights of the States and by=
 distributing equally the=20

benefit and burden of the Union."  The nullifiers had carefully planned the=
 evening's proceedings=20

with  Her companion in debauchery, Marguerite de Bourgogne, met a fate more=
 suddenly tragic,=20

though surely not more pathetic. Her marriage with Louis le Hutin could hav=
e been dissolved, of=20

course, on the score of adultery; but Louis preferred less public methods. =
Having become king, on=20

the death of his father, not many months after Marguerite's disgrace, he de=
sired to find another=20

wife; so Marguerite was put to death in the Chateau Gaillard, being smother=
ed, it is said, between=20

two mattresses.  The third of the daughters-in-law of Philippe le Bel, the =
Countess Jeanne de=20

Poitiers, was more fortunate than her sister and Marguerite. When the three=
 had been arrested=20

she was separated from the other two and sent to Dourdan. Her character see=
ms to have been=20

better formed than that of Blanche, and she had not indulged in the excesse=
s proved against=20

Blanche and Marguerite. Mahaut was from the first firmly convinced of her i=
nnocence, and sent=20

frequent messages of consolation and sympathy to her during her confinement=
 in Dourdan.=20

Although she had been aware of the evil practices of her sister and her sis=
ter-in-law, it could=20

hardly be held an unpardonable=20
