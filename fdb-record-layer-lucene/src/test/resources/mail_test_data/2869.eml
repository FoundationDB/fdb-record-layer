bush" in Australia;=20

Sheila in a white coat trimmed plentifully with cotton wool made a pretty C=

Irish colleen; Mary, with bunches of mimosa, typified South Africa; and Est=
her, gorgeous in=20

Oriental drapery and numerous necklaces, was an Indian princess. But perhap=
s the most=20

successful costume of all was Lorna's. She had been chosen to take the char=
acter of New=20

Zealand, and was dressed in a pale yellow wrapper decorated with beautiful =
sprays of tinted=20

leaves. Round her head was a garland of orange blossoms, and in her arms sh=
e held great=20

branches of oranges and lemons, to typify the fruits of the country she was=
 impersonating. With=20

Lorna's dark eyes and hair the effect was most striking. She kept her pose =
admirably, scarcely=20

blinking an eyelid, though Mary palpably moved, Cabello, turns behind this =
suburb to the south-

west. It is a marshy ground filled with noisome and stagnant water. The tow=
n, which has at present=20

nearly nine thousand inhabitants, owes its origin to an illicit commerce, a=
ttracted to these shores=20

by the proximity of the town of Burburata, which was founded in 1549. It is=
 only since the=20

administration of the Biscayans, and of the company of Guipuzcoa, that Port=
o Cabello, which was=20

but a hamlet, has been converted into a well-fortified town. The vessels of=
 La Guayra, which is=20

less a port than a bad open roadstead, come to Porto Cabello to be caulked =
and repaired.  The=20

real defence of the harbour consists in the low batteries on the neck of la=
nd at Punta Brava, and=20

on the reef; but from ignorance of this principle, a new fort, the Mirador =
of Solano* has been=20

constructed at a great expense, on the mountains commanding the suburb towa=
rds the south. (*=20

The Mirador is situate eastward of the Vigia Alta, and=20

 clapped=20

enthusiastically. It was felt to be a very fitting finish to the festival. =
 "You kept your secret well,=20

girls," said Miss Morley, as she congratulated them afterwards. "I'm sure n=
obody had the least=20

hint. It was charmingly thought out and arranged. Come along now and have s=
ome tea. It has=20

really been a most successful afternoon."  Audience and performers, the lat=
ter in all the glory of=20

their pretty costumes, mingled together now for conversation and tea-drinki=
ng. Irene quickly joined=20

her family, and had much to say to them, and many questions to ask about th=
eir doings in Naples.=20

"I say, Renie," whispered Vincent, suddenly interrupting her, "tell me who'=
s that lovely girl? She=20

looked the best in the whole of your tableau."  Irene followed his glance t=
o the yellow-clad figure=20

handing the teacups which Miss Morley was filling.  "That's Lorna. One of m=

powder-mill.) More than ten thousand mules are annually exported from Porto=
 Cabello. It is=20

curious enough to see these animals embarked; they are thrown down with rop=
es, and then=20

hoisted on board the vessels by means of a machine resembling a crane. Rang=
ed in two files, the=20

mules with difficulty keep their footing during the rolling and pitching of=
 the ship; and in order to=20

frighten and render them more docile, a drum is beaten during a great part =
of the day and night.=20

We may guess what quiet a passenger enjoys, who has the courage to embark f=
or Jamaica in a=20

schooner laden with mules.  We left Porto Cabello on the first of March, at=
 sunrise. We saw with=20

surprise the great number of boats that were laden with fruit to be sold at=
 the market. It reminded=20

me of a fine morning at Venice. The town presents in general, on the side t=
owards the sea, a=20

cheerful and agreeable aspect. Mountains covered with vegetation, and crown=
ed with peaks called=20
