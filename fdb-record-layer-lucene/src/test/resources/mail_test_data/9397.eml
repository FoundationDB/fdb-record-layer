throughout commercial=20

England. Several cruisers were sent out to capture the _Argus_. This was ef=
fected in August by=20

the brig _Pelican_.  The Americans were partially compensated for these mis=
fortunes by the=20

capture of the British brig _Boxer_ by the brig _Enterprise_, Lieutenant Bu=
rrows. They fought off=20

Portland, at half pistol-shot distance, on the 3d of September, 1813. The c=
ommander of the=20

_Boxer_ (Lieutenant Blyth) had boastfully nailed his flag to her mast, and =
after a sharp, short, and=20

destructive engagement, she was compelled to surrender. Her second officer =
had to announce the=20

fact through his trumpet, for he could not haul down her flag. Burrows and =
Blyth were both slain,=20

and were buried side by side in a cemetery in Portland.  [Illustration: THE=
 "ESSEX," "PHOEBE,"=20

AND "CHERUB."--DRAWN BY J. O. DAVIDSON.]  One of the most remarkable cruise=
s made=20

during the war of 1812-15 was by Commander Porter in the frigate _Essex_. S=
he sailed from the=20

Delaware in October, 1812; went toward the equator to join the _Constitutio=
n_ and _Hornet_,=20

under Bainbridge; missed them; swept around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocea=
n, and went into=20

the harbor of Valparaiso, on the western coast of South America. Then she c=
ruised northward in=20

search of British armed whaling vessels, capturing several. Porter converte=
d them into war=20

vessels, and created for himself an active little squadron, with which he s=
ailed for the Marquesas=20

Islands. After remaining there awhile, he returned to Valparaiso, and at th=
at sea-port had a fierce=20

battle with two British vessels which had been sent to oppose his destructi=
ve career in the waters=20

of the Pacific. These were the frigates _Phoebe_ and _Cherub_.  These vesse=
ls cruised off the=20

harbor of Valparaiso, waiting for re-enforcements. The _Essex_, with her co=
nsort, _Essex Junior_,=20

in attempting to get to sea, became crippled by a squall, when the _Phoebe_=
 and _Cherub_=20

attacked, in violation of the rights of a neutral port. Then occurred one o=
f the most sanguinary sea-

fights of the war, and it was only when her officers and men were nearly al=
l slain or wounded, and=20

she was on fire, that the _Essex_ was surrendered. "We have been unfortunat=
e, but not=20

disgraced," wrote Porter to the Secretary of the Navy. That was in February=
, 1814. Porter had=20

carried the first American flag on a vessel of war ever seen in the Pacific=
 Ocean.  Commodore=20

Rodgers made a memorable cruise of one hundred and forty days on the stormy=
 Atlantic in 1813,=20

sailing from Boston in the frigate _President_ in April. He captured eleven=
 British merchant vessels=20

and the armed schooner _Highflyer_, a tender of Admiral Warren's flag-ship.=
 Rodgers had been=20

put in possession of some of the British signals. When he saw the _Highflye=
r_, he hoisted English=20

colors, and trying his signals, found to his delight that they were answere=
d. He then assumed the=20

character of a British officer. He decoyed the _Highflyer_ alongside the _P=
resident_, which he=20

pretended was the large British ship _Sea-Horse_, then in American waters. =
The commander of=20

the _Highflyer_ (Lieutenant Hutchinson) was thoroughly deceived. Rodgers or=
dered him to send=20

him his signal books. He obeyed, and soon followed them in person. He saw t=
he marines of the=20

_President_ in British uniform, and mistook them for his own countrymen.  "=
The _President_," said=20

the unsuspecting Hutchinson, "has spread alarm in British waters, and the m=
ain object of the=20

Admiral is to catch her."  "What kind of a man is Rodgers?" asked the Commo=
dore.  "I have never=20

seen him," said Hutchinson, "but have been told that he is an odd fish, and=
 hard to catch."  "Would=20

you like to meet him?"  "Indeed I would, with a vessel of equal size."  "Si=
r!" said Rodgers, in a tone=20

that startled the Lieutenant, "do you know what ship this is?"  "The _Sea-H=
orse_, of course."  "You=20

are mistaken. You are on board the _President_, and I am Commodore Rodgers.=
"  Then the band=20



struck up "Yankee Doodle," the coats of the marines were suddenly changed f=
rom scarlet to blue,=20

and the American flag was displayed over the quarter-deck. Rodgers took his=
 captive and his prize=20

to Newport. He made another less successful cruise, and about the middle of=
 January, 1814, he=20

dashed through the British blockading squadron at New York, and anchored in=
 the harbor.  The=20

British had carried on a distressing marauding warfare on the coasts during=
 1813, which kept the=20

smaller vessels of the navy and privateers vigilant and active. During that=
 summer there were only=20

three American frigates at sea, others being either blockaded or undergoing=
 repairs; and yet the=20

Americans, with indomitable will, resolved to carry on the war with vigor. =
In September,=20

Commodore Perry, in command of a squadron on Lake Erie, won a decisive vict=
ory over a British=20

squadron under Commodore Barclay, and thereby secured the absolute control =
of that lake.=20

Meanwhile Commodore Chauncey, in command on Lake Ontario, was performing ga=
llant services=20

there, standing in the way of British invasions on that frontier, and co-op=
erating efficiently with the=20

land forces on its borders.  [TO BE CONTINUED.]     [Illustration: "KEEP ST=

RS.=20

L. G. MORSE.   John Evans was raking hay in a field on the south side of hi=
s cottage, while his=20

wife was in the dairy printing butter for market. Little Elsy, their two-ye=
ar-old baby, was playing with=20

blocks on the sitting-room floor, and old Robin Hood, the dog, was asleep o=
n the grass close by=20

the door that opened on the lawn.  The sky was almost cloudless, and the su=
n blazed warm in the=20

fields.  "Just the weather to make the corn grow," said John Evans, resting=
 a quarter of a minute,=20

and looking contentedly over the wall at his flourishing corn blades, alrea=
dy two good inches at=20

least above those of his rich neighbor, Mr. Haverly.  "Elsy is safe," said =
Barbara, the trim little=20

house-maid. "I might as well knead up the bread." And she whisked through t=
he sitting-room so=20

fast, and with so little noise, that Elsy only looked up to see if a bird h=
ad flown in over the low half-

door.  Tired of her blocks at last, Elsy went and tugged at the door, and m=
ade the latch rattle.=20

Robin opened one eye--the one toward the house--and half-cocked an ear. But=
 Elsy kept up the=20

rattle long enough for him to get used to it, and drawing his tail closer u=
nder his nose, he ceased=20

paying any attention to the child. He knew she was behind the door. He had =
done his full duty by=20

standing on his hind-legs against it, and looking to see what she was about=
 before he settled=20

himself for his nap. She rattled the latch every day, but she had never bee=
n able to lift it--he=20

needn't have _that_ on his mind. So, by-and-by, when the crown of her littl=
e white head showed=20

itself above the door, Robin was dozing away, more sleepy than ever.  She h=
ad pushed her block-

box close to the sill, and stepped on it to take another view of the latch.=
 For Elsy was enterprising,=20

and had no more idea than have other two-year-old babies of remaining in ig=
norance of any new=20

and untried danger. Of course she succeeded at last, and so easily that she=
 pushed the door open=20

and let herself backward down the steps without waking the dog.  The oldest=
 mother goose in the=20

barn-yard was as energetic as Elsy. She quacked about among her neighbors u=
ntil she collected=20

the whole flock, and then matronized them down to the big shallow pond in f=
ront of issued from=20

es of the Ibicuy, and=20

let us leave him quiet and indolent, fighting occasionally at the =E2=80=9C=

jealousy, for politics, or any of the so-called reasons which make men shed=
 each other=E2=80=99s blood.=20



But commerce, holy commerce, thrice blessed nexus which makes the whole wor=
ld kin, reducing=20

all men to the lowest common multiple; commerce that curses equally both hi=
m who buys and him=20

who sells, and not content with catching all men in its ledgers, envies the=
 animals their happy=20

lives, was on the watch.  Throughout the boundaries of the River Plate, fro=
m Corrientes to the=20

bounds of Tucuman, San Luis de la Punta to San Nicholas, and to the farthes=
t limits of the stony=20

southern plains, nowhere were horses cheaper than in the close Rincones of =
the Ibicuy. Three,=20

four, or five, or at the most six dollars, bought the best, especially if b=
ut half-tamed, and a=20

convenient curve of the river allowed a steamboat to discharge or to load g=
oods, tied to a tree and=20

moored beside the bank.  Upon a day a steamer duly arrived, whistled, and a=
nchored, and from=20

her, in a canoe, appeared a group of men who landed, and with the assistanc=
e of a guide went to=20

the chief estancia of the place.  The owner, Cruz Cabrera, called also Cruz=
 el Narigudo, came to=20

his door, welcomed them, driving off his dogs, wondered, but still said not=
hing, as it is not polite to=20

ask a stranger what is the business that brings him to your house.  Mat=C3=
=A9 went round, and gin=20

served in a square-faced bottle, and drank out of a solitary wine-glass, th=
e stem long snapped in=20

the middle, and spliced by shrinking a piece of green cow-hide round a thin=
 cane, and fastening=20

the cane into a disc of roughly-shaped soft wood.  =E2=80=9CThree dollars b=

phrase=E2=80=94dear to economists and those who in their studies apart from=
 life weave webs in which=20

mankind is caught, decreed that at four dollars the deal was to be made.  B=
ut at the moment of=20

arrangement one of the strangers saw a fine chestnut colt standing saddled =
at the door, and=20

claimed him as a =E2=80=9Csweetener,=E2=80=9D and to save talk his master l=
et him go, and then, the money=20

counted over, the buyer, prepared to give a hand to catch the horses, and t=
o lead them singly to=20

the boat.  Plunging and snorting, sweating with terror, and half dead with =
fear, kicked, cuffed, and=20

pricked with knives, horse after horse was forced aboard, and stood tied to=
 a ring or stanchion, the=20

sweat falling in drops like rain from legs and bellies on the deck.  Only t=
he chestnut stood looking=20

uneasily about, and frightened by the struggles and the sound of blows fall=
ing upon the backs of=20

those his once companions in the wild gallops through the forest glades, wh=
o had been forced=20

aboard.  Then Cruz Cabrera cursed his folly with an oath, and getting for t=
he last time on his back=20

made him turn, passage, plunge, and started and checked him suddenly, then =
getting off=20

unsaddled him, and gave his halter to a man to lead him to the ship.  The h=
orse resisted, terrified=20

at the strange unusual sight, and one of the strangers, raising his iron wh=
ip, struck him across the=20

nose, exclaiming with an oath, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll show you what it is to=
 make a fuss, you damned four dollars=E2=80=99=20

worth, when once I get you safe aboard the ship.=E2=80=9D  And Cruz Cabrera=
, gripping his long knife, was=20

grieved, and said much as to the chastity of the stranger=E2=80=99s mother,=
 and of his wife, but underneath=20

his breath, not that he feared to cut a =E2=80=9Cgringo=E2=80=99s=E2=80=9D =
throat, but that the dollars kept him quiet, as they=20

have rendered dumb, priests, ministers of state, bishops and merchants, pri=
nces and peasants,=20

and have closed the mouths of three parts of mankind, making them silent co=
mplices in all the=20

villainies they see and hate, and still dare not denounce, fearing the scou=
rge of poverty, and the=20

smart lash which Don Dinero flourishes over the shoulders of all those who =
venture even remotely=20

to express their thoughts.  Quickly the Ibicuy melted into the mist, as the=
 wheezy steamer grunted=20



and squattered like a wounded wild duck, down the yellow flood.  Inside, th=
e horses, more dead=20

than alive, panted with thirst, and yet were still too timid to approach th=
e water troughs.  They=20

slipped and struggled on the deck, fell and plunged up again, and at each f=
all or plunge, the blows=20

fell on their backs, partly from folly, partly from the satisfaction that s=
ome men feel in hurting=20

anything which fate or Providence has placed without the power of resistanc=
e in their hands.=20

Instinct and reason; the hypothetic difference which good weak men use as a=

their conscience pricks them for their sins of omission and commission to t=
heir four-footed=20

brethren.  But a distinction wholly without a difference, and a link in the=
 long chain of fraud and=20

force with which we bind all living things, men, animals, and most of all o=
ur reasoning selves, in=20

one crass neutral-tinted slavery.  Who that has never put his bistouri upon=
 the soul, and hitherto=20

no vivisectionist (of men or animals) can claim the feat, shall say who suf=

 and the dogmatics of=20

the so-called scientists which bid so fair to worthily replace those of the=
 theologians, but who shall=20

say if animals, when suddenly removed from all that sanctifies their lives,=
 do not pass agonies far=20

more intense than such endured by those whose education or whose reason=E2=
=80=94what you will=E2=80=94still=20

leaves them hope?  By the next morning the wheezy, wood-fired steamer was i=
n the roads of=20

Buenos Ayres, the exiles of the Ibicuy with coats all starring, flanks tuck=
ed up, hanging their=20

heads, no more the lightsome creatures of but yesterday.  Steam launches, p=
itching like porpoises=20

in the shallow stream, whale-boats manned by Italians girt with red sashes,=
 and with yellow shirts=20

made beautiful with scarlet horse-shoes, and whose eyes glistened like diam=
onds in their roguish,=20

nut-coloured faces, came alongside the ship.  Lighters, after much expendit=
ure of curses and vain=20

reaches with boat-hooks at the paddle-floats, hooked on, and dropped astern=
.  The donkey-engine=20

started with a whirr, giving the unwilling passengers another tremor of ala=
rm, and then the work of=20

lowering them into the flat-bottomed lighters straight began.  Kickings and=
 strugglings, and one by=20

one, their coats all matted with the sweat of terror, they were dropped int=
o the boat.  One or two=20

slipped from the slings, and landed with a broken leg, and then a dig with =
a =E2=80=9Cfacon=E2=80=9D ended their=20

troubles, and their bodies floated on the shallow waves, followed by flocks=
 of gulls.  Puffing and=20

pitching, the tug dragging the lighter reached the ocean-steamer=E2=80=99s =
side.  Again the donkey-engine=20

rattled and whirred, and once again the luckless animals were hoisted up, s=
towed on the lower=20

deck in rows in semi-darkness, and after a due interval the vessel put to s=
ea.  =E2=80=9CWho would not sell=20

a farm and go to sea?=E2=80=9D the sailor says, and turns his quid remarkin=

_
house. They pottered a good deal on the way among mud-puddles, for there ha=
d been a shower=20

the night before.  Dame Evans pottered too in the dairy, but that was becau=
se pretty Miss Ruth=20

Haverly called to bespeak some of the butter before it should be sent to ma=
rket, and was trying=20

her hands at the printing. Very soft white hands they were, and Mrs. Evans =
enjoyed watching=20

them.  "There," she said, "that one is a beauty!" as Ruth turned one of the=
 yellow balls into a dish.=20

But she never would have allowed anybody else to meddle so with her butter.=
 A spot on the dairy=20

shelf would have been as great a crime as a speck on the snow-white kerchie=
f crossed on her=20

bosom. But no thought would she have taken of the butter, nor even of daint=
y Miss Ruth, had she=20

known what Elsy was doing. Nor would Barbara have cared so much about the b=
read. She was=20

singing, and did not hear Elsy fumbling with the door-latch.  But the child=
 had trotted by Robin=20

Hood, down the long path, all the way to the river, and was so pleased at t=
he feat that she laughed=20

aloud. It was the first chance she had ever had to get alone to the river. =
Somebody had always=20

been on hand to pull her away just in time to save her feet from touching t=
he water. Now they=20

touched it in comfort, and little cool ripples washed over the toes of her =
stockings--she had pulled=20

her shoes off long ago in the house. She ran up and down the edge of the wa=
ter a few times, and=20

then began picking up sticks and stray leaves to throw into it. Higher and =
higher her spirits rose=20

with the sport. If it had not been for Barbara's song, Robin would surely h=
ave heard Elsy shout.=20

But Robin was lazy in his old age, and was actually snoring. Elsy spied a p=
retty goose-feather, and=20

gave it a toss. The breeze carried it farther out on the water than the sma=
ll maid intended. But she=20

was fearless, and catching at some cat-tails growing on the bank, she waded=
 in after her feather.=20

[Illustration: THE RESCUE.--DRAWN BY H. P. SHARE.]  She stumbled over the u=
neven bottom,=20

and the stones hurt her soft little feet. Down she went, head and all under=
 water, just as the geese=20

came, ready at last for their swim. When they saw Elsy splashing about, the=
y thought she was=20

trespassing. Or perhaps they understood perfectly well that the river, alth=
ough safe for them, was=20

a dangerous place for the innocent baby. Who knows? Certain it was that as =
Elsy went down=20

under the water, the geese flapped their wings, and made a tremendous racke=
t. They made such=20

a noise as never had been heard in the place before. They wakened old Robin=
 at last, and brought=20

him quick as a flash to his post of duty. Oh, he could make noise enough th=
en, to be sure! He=20

could tear round the house like a hurricane, dash down the path and into th=
e water, seize little=20

Elsy's dress, and hold her head above the surface until her father came to =
the rescue, plunged=20

into the river, and in another minute had borne his darling safely to land.=
 Her bright eyes were=20

closed, and her form lay quite senseless against her father's bosom, while =
Robin looked up to be=20

sure she was safe, and Barbara ran terrified from the house, her singing si=
lenced at last.  But Elsy=20

opened her eyes again before long. Joy greeted the little life saved, and t=
he mother half=20

smothered old Robin with kisses, in spite of his dripping coat, which utter=
ly ruined her kerchief.=20

John Evans and his good dame would never have cheated a mouse of its due, y=
et they petted and=20

honored old Robin as long as he lived, and told children and grandchildren =
hundreds of times how=20

it was _he_ saved Elsy, when, as sure as anything, the whole credit was due=
 to the geese.=20
