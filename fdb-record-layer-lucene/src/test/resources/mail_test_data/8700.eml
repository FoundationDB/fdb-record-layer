told the women to feed them and give them coffee. They put a powder in the =
coffee. The Japs will=20

fall asleep."  "Great! But the German?" Jack asked.  "That's what you've go=
t to find out right now.=20

It's not far. We'll be there in ten minutes--I mean to the ridge--looking d=
own on the plane."  "And=20

then?" Jack caught his breath.  "Then we can decide what is to be done."  A=
fter that they walked=20

on in silence. Only once Jack whispered, "Listen!"  They stood still listen=
ing.  "What was it?" she=20

whispered.  "I thought I heard a motor, not like a plane motor, but one on =
a boat. Guess I was=20

mistaken."  Once again they moved forward in the growing dusk.             =
                      CHAPTER=20

XXIV                             TWILIGHT BATTLE   They came at last to the=
 crest of the ledge hanging=20

over the spot where the jet plane rested on the rock beside the sea. Since =
the surface of the ledge=20

sloped, it was possible for them to remain some thirty feet from the brink =
of the hundred-foot drop=20

and still see the plane.  Jack would have walked to the brink of the cliff =
for a clearer view, but Mary=20

pulled him back.  "Wait!" she whispered. "It is still light. If that man is=
 down there he may see you.=20

You'd stand out against the sky. Sit down here. We'll watch to see if anyth=
ing moves down there.=20

There's a steep path round this ledge. We can reach the jet plane in two mi=
nutes." She pulled him=20

to a seat beside her.  "There's no one down there," Jack said in a low voic=
e after half a minute of=20

silence. "This is my chance. We might as well go down."  "No! Wait!" the gi=
rl insisted.  A minute=20

passed--two--three minutes. Jack was restless. Darkness was throwing thin s=
hadows over the=20

plane, half hiding it.  He rose and walked almost to the brink of the cliff=
 and stood there staring=20

down.  "There's no one," he called softly without turning. "We'll go down."=
  At that instant a bulky=20

figure shot past the girl and straight at Jack. Only the girl's quick, pier=
cing scream saved the young=20

flier. Turning quickly, Jack threw out his arms to meet the man head on and=
 to bring him crashing=20

to earth close to the brink.  Realizing his perilous position, Jack fought =
desperately. He was no=20

mean fighter.  His opponent was larger and older than he and slower in his =
movements. The battle=20

raged over the surface of the cliff. Now they were close to the ledge, now =
away. Now Jack was up,=20

and now down again. This man was a beast. Once he bit Jack's finger to the =
bone. He tried to=20

knock him senseless by banging his head on the rocks. Jack's head was hard,=
 but this beating=20

made him groggy.  It was then that the big man snatched a knife from its sh=
eath to kill Jack. His=20

hand was up. The end appeared certain now. But suddenly something hard cras=
hed against that=20

upraised arm. The knife rang as it hit the rocks.  The stout hardwood club =
swung by the plucky girl-

-that for the moment had saved Jack's life--did not stop with the knife. It=
 came crashing down on=20

the German's head.  Stunned, the big fellow staggered to his feet, made a l=
unge at Mary, and lost=20

his balance. He fell to the rocky surface and started to roll slowly down t=
he slope. Ten seconds=20

later he had disappeared over the edge of the cliff.  "Wha--what happened?"=
 Jack rose groggily.=20

"No ma--matter what happened." The girl was a bit shaky. "Come on back and =
sit down."  "Wh--

where is he?" Jack stammered.  "He's gone for good. Come on," she urged.  T=
hey returned to the=20

shadows. Having regained his vantage point, Jack rubbed his battered head. =
"I must have=20

practically gone out," he murmured. "What happened to that Nazi?"  "Plenty!=
" said Mary. "But=20

nothing he did not deserve. Besides, this is war, and war is--"  "No picnic=
." Jack was himself again.=20

"How do you feel?" she asked.  He stood up, balanced himself for a moment, =
then went through=20

the motions of skipping a rope.  "You'll do." She sprang to her feet. "We h=
aven't a moment to lose.=20

Come on!"  Jack followed her over the steep, uncertain trail. Since she was=
 barefoot, native style,=20



her feet appeared to cling to the rocks. From time to time she gripped his =
hands to whisper, "This=20

is a bad spot."  And then they were on the level rock, racing for the plane=
.  "Are you sure?" Jack=20

hesitated with his hand on the jet plane.  "Yes, sure!" she whispered. "He =
fell too far. Couldn't=20

possibly bother us now. I'll send the natives to look him up later. But now=
, please hurry!"  She=20

joined him in climbing to the plane's top. While Jack dropped into the pilo=
t's place, she swung=20

down into the gunner's seat.  "Why!" she exclaimed in a whisper. "This is a=
n American twinflex=20

gun! I've fired them often!"  "Is it loaded?" Jack asked anxiously.  "Sure =
is."  "That's good. Keep a=20

sharp lookout. Don't shoot unless it is absolutely necessary."  "Trust me!"=
  He did trust her, more=20

than she knew.  After pulling down his canopy he switched on a pale light. =
"Just like my old scout=20

plane," he murmured.  As he studied the instruments and controls his amazem=
ent grew. At last he=20

exclaimed in a hoarse whisper, "This is an American plane, every bit of it.=
 The instruments even=20

have the makers' trade marks on them. How do you account for that?"  "I don=
't," said the girl.=20

Cautiously Jack tried out the controls. He set the motor whispering, that w=
as all. He released the=20

brakes. They glided forward three or four yards. He clamped on the brakes a=
gain.  As he tested=20

the instruments Mary whispered:  "Someone's coming down the trail. I heard =
a rock rolling down."=20

"Good grief!" came back in a hoarse whisper. "The Japs! We may have to ligh=
t out just as we are!=20

I'm practically ready to give it a try!"  "Wait," she whispered. "I haven't=
 said good-by to the natives.=20

They've really been wonderful."  "Yes, but--" Jack did not finish. That's a=
 woman for you! he=20

thought.  "I will wipe out the Japs if I must." She turned the machine gun =
noiselessly.  "That's the=20

thing to do."  "Yes, but I must be sure first. It might be-- There!" Her wh=
isper rose. "I saw one of=20

them duck into the shadows."  "Let them come on out into the open so you ca=
n get all three. We=20

can't--"  He stopped short. From the foot of the that the lightning, in its=
 course from the head to the=20

feet, meets with a chain or a truss, and almost invariably at least a porti=
on of the current follows=20

this, causing a deep burn where it again passes into the skin. All the exte=
rnal burns of the=20

lightning, except the initial one, are determined by the position and condi=
tions of the body, the=20

clothing, and the conductors near. All electricity obeys the same law and, =
roughly speaking,=20

follows the path or paths of least resistance.  The clothing worn by a pers=
on when struck by=20

lightning may be acted upon in the most various ways. Sometimes it is wholl=
y stripped off the=20

unfortunate sufferer, who, as in a case reported by Cook and Boulting, may =
have to be protected=20

with sacks or other hastily improvised coverings. In a case reported by Nas=
on, a girl of thirteen=20

was struck while in the street and most of her clothes stripped off and tor=
n to shreds, and the top=20

of her hat, which contained steel wires, was torn from the brim. In the cas=
e of Wilks the body was=20

stripped entirely naked and absolutely nothing left on except a portion of =
the left arm of the man=E2=80=99s=20

flannel shirt. The clothing is sometimes torn to the finest shreds, like th=
ose of a mouse=E2=80=99s nest, as=20

described by Van Horn, and in another case (Claes), where the patient was s=
truck while on board=20

ship, his woollen jacket was torn into fine bits, which stuck to the ropes,=
 and the deck was covered=20

with fibres of wool as fine as those of cotton-wool. In this case the woof =
of the trousers was said to=20

have been wholly destroyed, while the web was untouched.  The clothing is a=
lso often burnt. Not=20

only are holes burnt in it as is usually the case at the point where the li=
ghtning strikes and at the=20

point where it leaves the body, but it may be set on fire. It may be found =
smoking or in flames.  Of=20

all portions of the clothing injured, perhaps the coverings of the feet are=
 the most frequently so, as=20

the electricity is very apt to leave the body through the feet, and the res=
istance opposed is great.=20



Hence the boot or shoe is frequently injured. Sometimes it is pierced as by=
 a bullet, or a large hole=20

is torn in it, or it may be torn to pieces or reduced almost to lint, while=
 the foot remains uninjured. It=20

may be torn, shrivelled, and burnt. In one case the soles of the shoes had =
disappeared; in another=20

the leg of the boot was clearly divided from the sole and both straps were =
torn out; while again in=20

another the shoe was carried wholly off.  The amount of injury to the cloth=
ing does not necessarily=20

correspond to the amount done to the body. A person may be killed by lightn=
ing while the clothing=20

is uninjured. On the other hand, the clothing may be torn to pieces, carrie=
d away, or even partially=20

burnt, while the portion of the body underneath remains unhurt.  =3DSymptom=
atology.=3D=E2=80=94The=20

symptoms of stroke by lightning resemble, in a general way, those due to hi=
gh-tension currents of=20

electricity. As in the case of the latter, they can be divided into the dir=
ect, produced immediately by=20

the lightning itself, and the indirect, or secondary, produced through the =
medium of other factors.=20

In the milder cases the person struck feels dazed and benumbed and may or m=
ay not lose=20

consciousness for a short time. At the moment struck they may have the sens=
ation of a blow, and=20

they often see a blinding flash. On recovery of their faculties there may b=
e a temporary=20

an=C3=A6sthesia or weakness of one or more extremities, which rarely lasts =
more than twenty-four=20

hours. There is a general shock to the system, sometimes slight loss of mem=
ory for a time, and=20

occasionally nausea and vomiting. There are often discolorations of the ski=
n of medium extent,=20

and frequently burns and blisters. These persons have usually received the =
stroke on one=20

extremity or have escaped the full force. In the more severe cases the pati=
ent loses=20

consciousness immediately and may continue unconscious for some hours. He p=
asses into a=20

condition of collapse with rapid, feeble pulse and cold extremities, and th=
e pupils are dilated. On=20

recovery of his senses the same symptoms as in the less severe cases, only =
more pronounced,=20

are found. The loss of memory may be marked and the intellect temporarily w=
eakened, while the=20

weakness and an=C3=A6sthesia of the extremities persist longer. The externa=
l injuries, burns, and=20

wounds are liable to be more severe.  In the fatal cases where death is dir=
ectly due to the=20

electricity it is usually instantaneous or at least without recovery of con=
sciousness. It may be=20

caused by shock or by apoplexy, _i.e._, intracranial hemorrhage or by the d=
irect effect of the=20

electricity on the brain. Of course death is often due to burns or to indir=
ect traumatic injuries.  The=20

indirect traumatic injuries caused by lightning are due either to the loss =
of consciousness of the=20

patient, which causes him to fall and thus sustain injury, or to the direct=
 action of the electricity=20

upon him, knocking him down or throwing him to some distance, sometimes wit=
h great violence, or=20

lastly, and perhaps the most frequent cause, to the impact or pressure of o=
bjects which are torn or=20

cast down by the electricity and by striking or falling on a person produce=
 great injury. Thus=20

persons have been killed by the fall of buildings, sheds, or trees which we=
re struck by the=20

lightning, or their branches. Of course all kinds of traumata may be produc=
ed thus.  The direct=20

external injuries caused by lightning are burns, subcutaneous hemorrhages, =
discolorations and=20

markings of the skin either dendritic or metallic, lacerations or wounds.  =
=3DBurns=3D occur in nearly=20

all, perhaps all, severe cases of lightning stroke. They may be of any or a=
ll degrees, and may=20

extend over very small points or over the whole or nearly the whole body. T=
hey may consist in a=20

simple singeing of the hair, or they may be very deep and extend to the bon=
e. As before stated,=20

the deep burns are found at the points of resistance to the current, at its=
 points of entrance and=20

exit from the body, and, to a lesser degree, at all points where its course=
 is impeded. This occurs=20



wherever the clothes are fastened tightly or pressed against the body, henc=
e especially at the=20

neck, waist, knees, and sometimes at the ankles. The position=20


_
a parakeet where no parakeet should be.  "Thank goodness!" Jack exclaimed. =
"That's Stew!=20

Phew! What a close call!"  Pushing back his hood he answered the call. A mo=
ment later Stew was=20

climbing to Jack's side.  "What's up?" he demanded. "What's happened, anywa=
y? I thought you'd=20

been killed, and here--"  "You didn't miss it by much," Jack broke in. "Now=
 you're here, let's forget=20

the talking and get this jet plane into the air."  "I'm staying here!" Mary=
 declared.  "Oh! Must you?"=20

Deep consternation was registered by Jack's voice.  "I must." Her voice was=
 husky. "But not for=20

long. I'll come with Ted."  "If he doesn't beat you to the gun," said Jack.=
  "He won't do that," Stew=20

broke in. "He told me to hurry. He's all set, but said he would wait unless=
 he was driven off by the=20

Japs."  "Not much chance of that," Mary laughed lightly. "The Jappies are b=
eing royally entertained=20

by my friends, and after that--well, you fill in the picture. therefore, by=
 the point at which the=20

lightning strikes the person, the position at the moment, and by the arrang=
ement of the dress and=20

the presence of metallic substances. In the large majority of cases the upp=
er portion of the body is=20

the part first touched by the lightning, and thence it descends along the b=
ody to the ground. We=20

are apt, therefore, to find a severe burn about the upper portion of the bo=
dy, the head, neck, or=20

shoulders; then a scorching, singeing, or burning, more or less severe, in =
the form of a stripe or=20

stripes more or less broad down the body: the burns being deeper where the =
clothes are tighter or=20

where metallic objects come into contact with or are near the body; and fin=
ally a deep burn at the=20

nearest point of contact with the ground, usually the heel or some portion =
of the foot.  The burns,=20

however, vary greatly. The eyes may be burnt and severely injured or destro=
yed. The lightning has=20

been known to=20

"So long!" She was on the rock. "It's nice having known you."  "We'll see y=
ou in the air and on the=20

deck of the _Black Bee_." Jack gave the ship the gun. The plane whistled. H=
e released the=20

brakes. She slid into the sea. Giving her another spurt, he felt her rise i=
nto the air.  "We've got=20

plenty of fuel," he said to Stew. "We'll just circle a bit and see if we ca=
n pick up Ted and that girl."=20

"That's the best thing to do," was Stew's comment. "I'll feel a lot easier =
if Ted hits the old _Black=20

Bee's_ deck ahead of us."  "And sort of prepare the gang for this freak," s=
aid Jack. "Not a bad=20

idea."                                   CHAPTER XXV                       =

membrane within. The deeper burns not infrequently assume the form of holes=
. In Heusner=E2=80=99s=20

cases about twenty whitish-gray spots, varying from the size of a lentil to=
 that of a pea, were found=20

on the soles of the feet. The hair is usually singed and may be burnt off i=
n large areas, or wholly as=20

in a case reported by Bernard.  =3DWounds.=3D=E2=80=94These may be direct o=
r indirect. We shall speak here=20

only of the first. Like burns they occur usually at the points of greatest =
resistance, that is, the=20

places of entrance and exit, but they may be found in any part of the body.=
 They may be clean-cut,=20

as if made by a sharp knife, or they may be lacerated and ragged with the=
