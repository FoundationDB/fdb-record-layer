enlarged to meet if possible, the views of the court. Two elaborate laws on=
 the main question were=20

passed in 1879, and these with several amendments since made rest undisturb=
ed on the statutes.=20

One of these is generally known as the "levee law," and the other as the "f=
arm drainage act." They=20

cover nearly the same subject matter, and were passed to compromise conflic=
ting views. These=20

laws relate to "combined drainage." "Individual drainage" was not discussed=
. As the law does not=20

undertake to define how deep you may plow or what crop you shall raise, so =
it was thought=20

unnecessary to make any provisions about the drainage of your own land.  CO=
URT DECISION.--

To the public surprise the Appellate court at Ottawa in two decisions prono=
unced individual=20

drainage unlawful. As this decision is notable, and the subject of controve=
rsy, its history should be=20

known. In 1876, Mr. C. Pilgrim, of Bureau county, laid about sixty rods of =
two-inch tile up a slight=20

depression in his corn-field, discharging the same under a box culvert in t=
he public road. This=20

depression continued into a pasture field of Mr. J. H. Mellor, of Stark cou=
nty, about eighteen rods=20

to a running stream. Mr. Mellor sued Mr. Pilgrim for trespass, and the case=
 was twice tried=20

successively in the circuit courts of Stark and Bureau counties. The juries=
 each time decided for=20

Mr. Pilgrim, but the Appellate court each time reversed the decision; and f=
inally worried Mr. Pilgrim=20

into yielding to a judgment of one cent damages. The material part of that =
decision is as follows:=20

MELLOR VS. PILGRIM.--"The appellant had the right to own and possess his la=
nd free from the=20

increased burden arising from receiving the surface water from the land of =
appellee through=20

artificial channels made by appellee, for the purpose of carrying the surfa=
ce water therefrom more=20

rapidly than the same would naturally flow; and the appellant having such r=
ight for any invasion=20

thereof the law gives him an action. * * * If, as we have seen, the appelle=
e by making the drain in=20

question collected the surface water upon his own land and discharged the s=
ame upon the lands=20

of the appellant in increased quantity and in a different manner than the s=
ame would naturally run,=20

the act was unlawful because of its consequences, and the subjecting of app=
ellant's lands to such=20

increased and different burden than would otherwise attach to it, was an in=
vasion of appellant's=20

rights from which the law implies damages, and in such case proof of the wr=
ongful act entitles the=20

plaintiff to recover nominal damages at least."  Under this decision it is =
not easy to see how a man=20

can lawfully cut a rod of ditch or lay tile on his own land, unless he can =
contrive some way to stop=20

the flow of water.  1. The lower man may recover without proving that he is=
 damaged because to=20

drain is "wrongful."  2. Such drainage being a continuing trespass, subject=
s the perpetrator to=20

never ending law suits and foredoomed defeats.  3. The lower man may forbid=
 you to drain, or=20

exact such tribute as he may dictate.  4. As the first man below must be co=
nsulted, why not the=20

second, and how far this side of the Gulf is the limit of this trespass?  H=
ere, as I have elsewhere, I=20

challenge this as bad of the Rocky Mountains, and east of the mountains nea=
r the sources of the=20

Arkansaw and Missouri rivers, extending even on the spurs of those mountain=
s; a country the=20

highest perhaps in North America, with a great and continued descent to the=
 Pacific on the one=20

side, and to the Gulf of Mexico on the other.  The barrens, also, found in =
Kentucky, are another=20

evidence that water had no agency in their formation--they are situate, it =
is believed, in the=20

elevated parts of the country exclusively.  The writer of this, deeming it =
unnecessary to say more,=20

or to produce more facts, (although much more may be said, and many more fa=
cts produced) to=20

prove that prairies were not lakes, will now endeavour to prove that they w=
ere occasioned by the=20

_combustion of vegetables_.  Prairies are found in those countries only tha=
t are congenial to the=20



growth of grass, and only where the soil is sufficiently rich to produce it=
 luxuriantly--they are found=20

commonly on high plains, sufficiently drained to prevent water from remaini=
ng on them the whole=20

year; for it is by no means necessary that they should be always dry; on th=
e contrary, if they are=20

sufficiently level to prevent the rains from running off immediately, the g=
rass will grow thicker and=20

higher--but they must be sufficiently dry to burn, at least once in two or =
three years, during the=20

long, dry season, called _Indian summer_. It has been universally remarked,=
 that these seasons=20

are much longer as we proceed westerly--commencing usually in October, and =
continuing a month=20

and a half or two months, during which the vegetation is killed by the fros=
ts, and dried by the sun;=20

the wet prairies are also dried, and before the season has expired, the gra=
ss is perfectly=20

combustible.  The Indians, it is presumed, (and the writer, from a residenc=
e in their country and=20

with them, is well acquainted with their customs) burn the woods, not _ordi=
narily_ for the purpose=20

of taking or catching game, as suggested by Mr. A. but for many other advan=
tages attending that=20

practice. If the woods be not burned as usual, the hunter finds it impossib=
le to kill the game, which,=20

alarmed at the great noise made in walking through the dry grass and leaves=
, flee in all directions=20

at his approach. Also the Indians travel much during the winter, from one v=
illage to another, and to=20

and from the various hunting grounds, which becomes extremely painful and l=
aborious, from the=20

quantity of briers, vines, grass, &c. To remedy these and many other inconv=
eniences, even the=20

woods were originally burned so as to cause prairies, and for the same and =
like reasons they=20

continue to be burned towards the close of the Indian summer.  Woodland is =
not commonly=20

changed to prairie by one burning, but by several successive conflagrations=
; the first will kill the=20

undergrowth, which causing a greater opening, and admitting the sun and air=
 more freely,=20

increases the quantity of grass the ensuing season: the conflagration conse=
quently increases, and=20

is now sufficiently powerful to destroy the smaller timber; and on the thir=
d year you behold an open=20

prairie.  Ordinarily, all the country, of a nature to become prairie, is al=
ready in that state; yet the=20

writer of this has seen, in the country=20


_
order of nature, as well as custom, and can not be endured as the public po=
licy of Illinois. Let us=20

contemplate the exact opposite principle. "A land owner may drain his land =
for agricultural=20

purposes by tile or open ditch, in the line of natural drainage, into any n=
atural outlet on his own=20

land or into any drainage depression leading to some natural outlet."  This=
 proposition is generally=20

regarded as self evident, seasons, more than one hundred acres of woodland =
together converted=20

into prairie. And again, where the grass has been prevented from burning by=
 accidental causes, or=20

the prairie has been depastured by large herds of domestic cattle, it will =
assume, in a few years,=20

the appearance of a young forest. Numerous proofs of this fact can be adduc=
ed, but a few shall=20

suffice. The vicinity of St. Louis and St. Charles affords=20


_
respect to the court, let us give some of the considerations on which it re=
sts:  1. Improved=20

agriculture is an element in civilization.  2. Drainage belongs to good agr=
iculture, is extensively=20

practiced and must often precede the plow.  3. The surplus water can not be=
 stored or annihilated,=20

and the course of drainage is situated on what are termed first and second =
bottoms, or flats--the=20

former on the Missisippi, the latter on the Missouri; the second or upper b=
ottoms, in both, are high=20

plains, that commence within a few hundred yards of the rivers, and extend =
back many miles; all=20

the old French inhabitants will tell you, that the prairies=20
