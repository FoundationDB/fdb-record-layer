admiration.  In telling in brief outline the story of Mohammad's life I hav=
e endeavoured to avoid=20

controversial points. I have tried to convey in the simplest manner the vie=
w of that life which a=20

study of the authorities must force upon every unbiassed mind. Many of the =
events of=20

Mohammad's life have been distorted and credited with ignoble motives by Eu=
ropean biographers;=20

but on the facts they mainly agree, and these I have narrated, without encu=
mbering them with the=20

ingenious adumbrations of their learned recorders. But there are some thing=
s in the Prophet's life=20

which have given rise to charges too weighty to be dismissed without discus=
sion. He has been=20

accused of cruelty, sensuality, and insincerity; he has been called a 'bloo=
dthirsty tyrant,' a=20

voluptuary, and an impostor.  The charge of cruelty scarcely deserves consi=
deration. I have=20

already spoken of the punishment of the Jews, which forms the ground of the=
 accusation. One has=20

but to refer to Mohammad's conduct to the prisoners after the battle of Bed=
r, to his patient=20

tolerance towards his enemies at Medina, his gentleness to his people, his =
love of children and the=20

dumb creatures, and above all, his bloodless entry into Mekka, and the comp=
lete amnesty he gave=20

to those who had been his bitter enemies during eighteen years of insult an=
d persecution and=20

finally open war, to show that cruelty was no part of Mohammad's nature.  T=
o say that=20

Mohammad, or any other Arab, was sensual in a higher degree than an ordinar=
y European is=20

simply to enounce a well-worn axiom: the passions of the men of the sunland=
 are not as those of=20

the chill north. But to say that Mohammad was a voluptuary is false. The si=
mple austerity of his=20

daily life, to the very last, his hard mat for sleeping on, his plain food,=
 his self-imposed menial=20

work, point him out as an ascetic rather than a voluptuary in most senses o=
f the word. Two things=20

he loved, perfumes and women; the first was harmless enough, and the specia=
l case of his wives=20

has its special answer. A great deal too much has been said about these wiv=
es. It is a melancholy=20

spectacle to see professedly Christian biographers gloating over the storie=
s and fables of=20

Mohammad's domestic relations like the writers and readers of 'society' jou=
rnals. It is, of course, a=20

fact that whilst the Prophet allowed his followers only four wives he took =
more than a dozen=20

himself; but be it remembered that, with his unlimited power, he need not h=
ave restricted himself to=20

a number insignificant compared with the hareems of some of his successors,=
 that he never=20

divorced one of his wives, that all of them save one were widows, and that =
one of these widows=20

was endowed with so terrific a temper that Aboo-Bekr and 'Othman had alread=
y politely declined=20

the honour of her alliance before the Prophet married her: the gratificatio=
n of living with a vixen=20

cannot surely be excessive. Several of these marriages must have been enter=
ed into from the=20

feeling that those women whose husbands had fallen in battle for the faith,=
 and who had thus been=20

left unprotected, had a claim upon the generosity of him who prompted the f=
ight. Other marriages=20

were contracted from motives of policy, in order to conciliate the heads of=
 rival factions. It was not=20

a high motive, but one does not look for very romantic ideas about love-mat=
ches from a man who=20

regarded women as 'crooked ribs,' and whose system certainly does its best =
to make marriage=20

from love impossible; yet, on the other hand, it was not a sensual motive. =
Perhaps the strongest=20

reason--one of which it is impossible to over-estimate the force--that impe=
lled Mohammad to take=20

wife after wife was his desire for male offspring. It was a natural wish th=
at he should have a son=20

who should follow in his steps and carry on his work; but the wish was neve=
r gratified,=20

Mohammad's sons died young. After all, the overwhelming argument is his fid=
elity to his first wife.=20

When he was little more than a boy he married Khadeejeh, who was fifteen ye=
ars older than=20



himself, with all the added age that women gain so quickly in the East. For=
 five-and-twenty years=20

Mohammad remained faithful to his elderly wife, and when she was sixty-five=
, and they might have=20

celebrated their 'silver wedding,' he was as devoted to her as when first h=
e married her. During all=20

those years there was never a breath of scandal. Thus far Mohammad's life w=
ill bear microscopic=20

scrutiny. Then Khadeejeh died; and though he married many women afterwards,=
 some of them=20

rich in youth and beauty, he never forgot his old wife, and loved her best =
to the end: 'when I was=20

poor she enriched me, when they called me a liar she alone believed in me, =
when all the world=20

was against me she alone remained true.' This loving, tender memory of an o=
ld wife laid in the=20

grave belongs only to a noble nature; it is not to be looked for in a volup=
tuary.[17]  When, however,=20

all has been said, when it has been shown that Mohammad was not the rapacio=
us voluptuary=20

some have taken him for, and that his violation of his own marriage-law may=
 be due to motives=20

reasonable and just from his point of view the other side. He stretched one=
 fore-paw far out,=20

hoping to grasp the edge, and it did touch the rock, but it only scratched =
and scraped it.  When he=20

found himself falling downward, he thrust out the other fore-leg and clawed=
 at the steep side of the=20

cliff. But there was nothing for him to hold to. The rocks were so hard tha=
t his claws could get no=20

purchase.  Down he went another yard. The edge of the cliff was over his he=
ad, and fifty feet=20

below was the hard bottom of the ravine. A fall there would surely dash out=
 his brains and break=20

every bone in his body.  Twenty feet down, doubling, whirling and screaming=
, Puma saw a small=20

stunted tree growing from a cleft in the side. He made one mighty lunge for=
 this, and caught it. He=20

landed with a thud against it, and clung to its branches for dear life. He =
was so shaken by the fall=20

that for a moment he could do nothing but blink and gasp. The tree had scra=
tched him in a dozen=20

places, and the hard rocks bruised and hurt his body. One paw was bleeding,=
 and the other was=20

so sore that he held it up in the air.  Over his head, some twenty feet, wa=
s the top of the cliff, with=20

its sides so steep that no Puma could hope to crawl up them. Below was the =
bottom which=20

seemed equally difficult to reach. Opposite, looking down at him, were Timb=
er and his family.=20

=E2=80=9CWhat a lucky fall for you, Puma,=E2=80=9D jeered Timber. =E2=80=9C=
And what a poor jump! White Tail and Young=20

Black Buck cleared it easily, and you couldn=E2=80=99t cross it! Now, bragg=
art, what are you going to do to=20

get out? You can hang there and rot before I=E2=80=99ll help you! Ho! Ho! Y=
ou call my tribe cowards! Then I=20

call you and yours dirty braggarts! You couldn=E2=80=99t=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D =
 A rumbling growl at Timber=E2=80=99s left caused him to=20

turn suddenly. Puma=E2=80=99s mate was facing him, with her eyes spitting f=
ire, and her great right claw=20

raised to strike.  =E2=80=9CSon of a coward,=E2=80=9D she thundered, =E2=80=
=9Chow dare you speak that way to one of my=20

family! Puma may be caught down there, but you have me to reckon with!=E2=
=80=9D  Timber immediately=20

saw his mistake. He had forgotten Mrs. Puma, who was almost as ferocious as=
 Puma. She was=20

smaller, but fully as quick and lithe. Timber=E2=80=99s manners immediately=
 changed, and he became as=20

meek and fawning as he was before threatening and defiant.  =E2=80=9CI didn=
=E2=80=99t refer to you, Mrs. Puma,=E2=80=9D he=20

whined. =E2=80=9COf course, I know you are much stronger and quicker than P=
uma, and=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou lie, you=20

sniveling cur!=E2=80=9D interrupted Mrs. Puma. =E2=80=9CFor the tail of a d=
eer I=E2=80=99d knock you in the ravine for my mate=20

to eat for his supper.=E2=80=9D  Timber slinked back from the edge. He knew=
 that one blow from that=20

upraised paw would send him hurtling through space. But once back from the =
edge his manner=20

changed again. Mrs. Puma stood near the edge now, and surrounding her was t=
he half circle of=20

wolves. All of Timber=E2=80=99s pack had arrived, and they were as thirsty =
as he for blood. They were ten=20

to one.  It flashed through Timber=E2=80=99s mind that this was a good time=
 to settle an old score with=20



Puma. He had never taken kindly to Puma=E2=80=99s lordly ways in dividing t=
he hunting ground between=20

them. Puma had always claimed more than his share of the prey. Sometimes he=
 had eaten three=20

quarters of a carcass, and only turned over a small portion to Timber=E2=80=
=99s family.  And they were a=20

hungry family, half starved at times when the hunting was poor. All his old=
 grievances came back=20

to him, and he felt that here was a chance to settle the dispute for good. =
Puma was caught in the=20

ravine, where he might starve and die. Why not then push Mrs. Puma after hi=
m?  =E2=80=9COh, Mrs.=20

Puma,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cyou flatter me. My family aren=E2=80=99t s=
uch cowards as you think. Just to show you turn=20

around and see them. They=E2=80=99re all here=E2=80=94the whole pack!=E2=80=
=9D  Mrs. Puma whirled about and saw the=20

semi-circle of snarling, snapping wolves. Then for the first time in her li=
fe she felt afraid. She might=20

kill two or three of Timber=E2=80=99s family before they conquered her, but=
 eventually they would drive her=20

over the cliff. But it was no time to show fear. That would be the signal f=
or the wolves to close in on=20

her.  =E2=80=9CI see them=E2=80=94the whole pack,=E2=80=9D she snarled. =E2=
=80=9CAnd every one of them a coward! Not one dare=20

touch me unless the others push him within reach of my claws. See, the whol=
e pack jumps and=20

screams when I strike.=E2=80=9D  With a vicious drive of her paw she made t=
hose nearest leap back in fear.=20

She followed this up with another drive. Timber saw that, unless he acted a=
t once, his family would=20

become panic-stricken. Raising himself on his hind feet ready for a spring,=
 he opened his mouth,=20

and uttered the hunting cry of the pack. Then at a given signal they attack=
ed all at once.  They=20

darted forward with yelps of defiance, Timber leading. But what a surprise =
awaited them! Mrs.=20

Puma had guessed their actions, and with a mighty spring in the air she lea=
ped clear over the=20

backs of the encircling crowd. It was a wonderful spring, and nothing but f=
ear could have made her=20

do it. It landed her safely back of the wolves.  Then before they could tur=
n and charge again, she=20

took another spring, and was safe in the branches of a tree. =E2=80=9CSome =
other day, thou dog of a=20

coward!=E2=80=9D Mrs. Puma said. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll sleep=20


_
remains the fact that some of the soorahs of the Kur-an bear unmistakable m=
arks of self-

accommodation and personal convenience; that Mohammad justified his domesti=
c excesses by=20

words which he gave as from God. And hence the third and gravest charge, th=
e charge of=20

imposture. We must clearly understand what is meant by this accusation. It =
is meant that the=20

Prophet _consciously_ fabricated speeches, and palmed them off upon the peo=
ple as the very=20

word of God. The question, it will at once be perceived, has nothing whatev=
er to do with the truth=20

or untruth of the revelations. Many an earnest enthusiast has uttered proph=
ecies and exhortations=20

which waiting.=E2=80=9D  Having got Mrs. Puma out of trouble we will follow=
 White Tail in the next story.=20

STORY IX                     YOUNG BLACK BUCK HAS AN ACCIDENT   It is hard =
work to starve out=20

Puma the Mountain Lion when treed, and perhaps harder yet to imprison him o=
n the side of a=20

steep cliff. Timber Wolf knew this, and after the escape of Mrs. Puma up th=
e tree, he grew uneasy,=20

and decided that it was safer for him to lead the pack back to their own hu=
nting ground.  When=20

they had gone Mrs. Puma leaped down to the ground, and ran to the edge of t=
he ravine to see=20

what had become of her mate. She was not greatly=20


_
believed to be the promptings of the Spirit, and no man can charge such an =
one with imposture.=20

He thoroughly believes what he says, and the fault is in the judgment, not =
the conscience. The=20

question is clearly narrowed to this: Did Mohammad believe he was speaking =
the words of God=20

equally when he declared that permission was given him to take unto him mor=
e wives, as when he=20

proclaimed 'There is no god but God'? It is a question that concerns the co=
nscience of man; and=20

each must answer it for himself. How far a man may be deluded into believin=
g everything he says=20

is inspired it is impossible to define. There are men to-day who would seem=
 to claim bottom of the=20

chasm, and was looking up to see where she was. With a little cry of joy sh=
e trotted down to the=20

end of the ravine to rejoin him.  Meanwhile, of course, White Tail and Youn=
g Black Buck were=20

running like the wind, anxious to get as far away from their pursuers as th=
ey could. They didn=E2=80=99t=20

know what had happened at Black Ravine, and they couldn=E2=80=99t stop to i=
nvestigate. The fear that the=20

wolves and Mountain Lions might still be on their trail kept them going unt=
il they were nearly=20

exhausted.  One mile, two miles, three miles they ran without stopping or l=
ooking around, fear=20

lending speed to their legs. Then something happened which brought them to=
=20


_
Mohammad's time it was so much easier to believe in one's self. Now, one ne=
ver wants a friend to=20

remind him of his weakness; then, there were hundreds who would fain have m=
ade the man think=20

himself God. It is wonderful, with his temptations, how great a humility wa=
s ever his, how little he=20

assumed of all the god-like attributes men forced upon him. His whole life =
is one long argument for=20

his loyalty to truth. He had but one answer for his worshippers, 'I am no m=
ore than a man, I am=20

only human.' 'Do none enter Paradise save by the mercy of God?' asked 'Aish=
eh. 'None, none,=20

none,' he answered. 'Not even thou by thy own merits?' 'Neither shall I ent=
er Paradise unless God=20

cover me with His mercy.' He headfirst to the ground. When he tried to get =
up again, he groaned=20

with pain, and held a fore-leg in the air as if it hurt him.  =E2=80=9COh, =
I=E2=80=99ve broken my leg!=E2=80=9D he cried. =E2=80=9CI can=E2=80=99t=20

run another step. They=E2=80=99ll catch me now, I know! I can=E2=80=99t esc=
ape them!=E2=80=9D  White Tail, whose=20

momentum had carried him some distance ahead, stopped and turned around.  =
=E2=80=9CLet me see it,=E2=80=9D he=20

said, sniffing at the leg. After quickly examining it, he added; =E2=80=9CN=
o, it isn=E2=80=99t broken=E2=80=94only sprained.=20

Can=E2=80=99t you stand on it?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo, not for an instant. O=
h, what will become of me! Hark! Isn=E2=80=99t that Puma=20

growling?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D replied White Tail, listening wit=
h his head flung back and his nose in the air.=20

=E2=80=9CThen it=E2=80=99s Timber calling, I=E2=80=99m sure it is.=E2=80=9D=
  White=20


_
and that one difference served only to increase his humbleness, and render =
him the more=20

sensitive to his shortcomings. He was sublimely confident of this single at=
tribute, that he was the=20

messenger of the Lord of the Daybreak, and that the words he spake came ver=
ily from Him. He=20

was fully persuaded--and no man dare dispute his right to the belief--that =
God had sent him to do=20

a great work among his people in Arabia. Nervous to the verge of madness, s=
ubject to hysteria,=20

given to wild dreamings in solitary places, his was a temperament that easi=
ly leads itself to=20

religious enthusiasm. He felt a subtle influence within him which he believ=
ed to be the movings of=20

the Spirit: he thought he heard a voice; it became real and audible to him,=
 awed and terrified him,=20

so that he fell into frantic fits. Then he would arise and utter some noble=
 saying; and what wonder=20

if he thought it came straight from highest heaven? It was not without a so=
re struggle that he=20

convinced himself of his own inspiration; but once admitted, the conviction=
 grew with his years and=20

his widening influence for good, and nothing then could shake his belief th=
at he was the literal=20

mouthpiece of the All-Merciful. When a man has come to exhausting run had m=
ade him very=20

nervous.  =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s something, but I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=
=80=99s Timber Wolf. He hasn=E2=80=99t had time to run around the=20

end of Black Ravine.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut he=E2=80=99ll be here soon,=E2=
=80=9D whined Young Black Buck.  =E2=80=9CThen we must be=20

going. We can=E2=80=99t stay here. You must run on three legs. You can do i=
t.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot so fast as Timber Wolf=20

or Puma can run on four legs. Oh, you won=E2=80=99t leave me, White Tail, w=
ill you? I shall die of fear if you=20

do. I=E2=80=99ve always been your friend.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI won=E2=80=99=
t leave you yet,=E2=80=9D replied White Tail. =E2=80=9CLie down in the=20

bushes, and I will run back and see if I can find Timber or Puma. If they=
=E2=80=99re coming=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t leave=20

me,=E2=80=9D interrupted Young Black Buck.  Just then, when White Tail was =
uncertain what to do, and so=20

nervous that he couldn=E2=80=99t stand still, Downy the Woodpecker appeared=
. He fluttered in a tree just as=20

if he had been there waiting for them all the time.  =E2=80=9COh, Downy,=E2=
=80=9D cried White Tail, =E2=80=9Cwhere are they?=20

Are they on our trail yet? Did they get across Black Ravine?=E2=80=9D  Down=
y finished hauling a grub out of=20

its hole in the tree bark before he answered. =E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D he then=
 said, =E2=80=9Cthey didn=E2=80=99t get across Black=20

Ravine, but Puma got in it. And he=E2=80=99s there now, screaming with rage=
.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe jumped and fell in=20


_
cannot be expected to discriminate between this saying and that. As the ins=
trument of God he has=20

lost his individuality; he believes God is ever speaking through his lips; =
he dare not question the=20

inspiration of the speech lest he should seem to doubt the  =E2=80=9CYes,=
=E2=80=9D nodded Downy. =E2=80=9CHe tried to=20

show Timber=E2=80=99s family what he could do, and he made a pretty sight o=
f himself. He missed the=20

opposite side by a few inches, and if it hadn=E2=80=99t been for a small tr=
ee growing on the rocks he would=20

have fallen to the bottom,=20
