Jack noted down the none too good distinguishing marks as described by the =
waitress, and went=20

to telephone them to the police as an additional help in capturing those wh=
o had gone with Cora's=20

car.  There was nothing more that could be done just then, and Jack was abo=
ut to suggest that, by=20

means of a little crowding, he could take his sister and her chums back to =
Chelton in his car when=20

the young woman who had charge of the tea room entered, it being her hour t=
o go on duty.=20

"What's the matter?" she asked, as she observed the group of excited young =
people about the=20

cashier's desk.  "Two strange young men went off with Miss Kimball's auto,"=
 was the cashier's=20

answer, and the circumstances were related.  "Two young men!" exclaimed the=
 manager. "Why I=20

"Tickets!" exclaimed Jack. "Tickets?"  "Yes. They seemed all right--I mean =
respectful and all that.=20

They said they had unexpectedly run out of funds and wanted to know if I wo=
uldn't buy some=20

railroad tickets they had to New York. I said I hadn't any use for them, an=
d couldn't get off to go to=20

New York anyhow, as this was our busy season."  "So you didn't buy them?" a=
sked Cora. "But I=20

thought you said----"  "I didn't buy the railroad tickets," said the young =
lady manager. "But I did=20

purchase two tickets for the opera performance that is to be given at Chelt=
on on Friday night. I'd=20

been wanting to go, and I was going to telephone for tickets when these you=
ng men said they had=20

two good ones they'd let me have for less than the regular price."  "And yo=
u took them?" asked=20

Walter.  "Yes. It seemed a bargain, and I am desirous to see the play."  "D=
o you mind letting me=20

see the tickets?" asked Jack.  "Certainly you may see them," was the answer=
, and from her=20

pocketbook, which she had left in charge of the cashier, the manager took o=
ut two slips of blue=20

pasteboard.  "Hum! They seem regular all right," remarked Jack. "Date and s=
eat numbers all=20

proper. I know where those seats are, too, right in the middle of the first=
 row balcony. I always sit=20

there myself when I go."  "They said they were good seats," declared the gi=
rl, "and I saved a=20

dollar. They wanted the money they said, for they had spent their last for =
some ice cream. They=20

seemed to be all right."  "Maybe they were," agreed Jack. "Of course it's p=
erfectly proper for=20

persons who can't use railroad or theatre tickets they have purchased, to s=
ell them again. And=20

these tickets seem to be the same as those you would get at the box office.=
 And there's no crime=20

in being without cash. But it is a crime to take an automobile."  "The only=
 question is whether the=20

same two fellows are involved," suggested Walter.  "That's it," agreed Jack=
. "I wish you girls had=20

had a better look at those who went off in the machine."  "It all happened =
so suddenly," Belle=20

explained.  "Yes, such things generally do," remarked Cora. "Well, there's =
nothing else to do, is=20

there?"  "I guess not," said Jack, who had telephoned in the additional des=
cription of the young=20

men who had sold the tickets, adding the information that there was only a =
suspicion that they=20

were the same two who were responsible for the taking of the car.  "If they=
 had only kept the=20

theatre tickets, instead of selling them," said Walter, "we'd have a good c=
hance of arresting them."=20

lady who had purchased the coupons. "I don't want a scene," and she regarde=
d Walter smilingly.=20

"Of course not," agreed Cora. "Oh, dear! My nice car, that I was counting o=
n taking to Camp=20

Surprise with me."  "We'll get it back before then!" declared Jack.  "Oh! b=
ut we're going earlier than=20

we planned originally," said Belle.  "And she wants you boys to come, too!"=
 cried Bess.  "No more=20

than you do!" snapped Belle, her fair face flushing.  "What's the idea?" as=
ked Walter.  "It's getting=20

so unbearably warm," said Cora, and then she explained that they might go e=
arlier than originally=20

planned to the bungalow camp in the mountains.  "Well, we might manage it,"=
 Jack said. "We'll talk=20

it over, Wally. Have to see Paul, though I guess he'd fit in anywhere Bess =
went."  "Oh! is that so?"=20

cried the plump girl, blushing in her turn.  The tea room people promised t=
o be on the lookout for=20

the strange young men, and to notify Jack or the police if they came around=
 again.  "But if they=20

were the ones who took the car they won't come back," Walter declared.  By =
crowding, all the=20

young people managed to get in Jack's car. On the way back to Chelton a sha=
rp lookout was kept=20

for the missing machine, but no trace of it was seen, and Cora was much dep=
ressed when she=20

reached home.  "Never mind," whispered Jack, "you may use mine, Sis, until =
yours shows up.=20

Don't worry, we'll get it yet."  "I hope so," murmured Cora.     CHAPTER IV=
--A CURIOUS STORY=20

Such measures as one might expect to have taken in a place like Chelton and=
 the surrounding=20

towns were taken by the authorities in an endeavor to recover Cora's stolen=
 automobile. For stolen=20

it certainly was, and not taken in a joke. That fact was patent when severa=
l days passed and no=20

trace of it was found and no word received as to where it might have been t=
aken or abandoned by=20

the two strange young men.  "They might merely have taken it to get some pl=
ace, seeing that they=20

had no money," observed Belle, when the three girls were talking the matter=
 over one day at=20

Cora's house.  "They had railroad tickets,  W.  Wild-Ducks, to keep. Wild-D=

"Yes, but to New York, and perhaps they didn't want to go there."  "I shoul=
d think New York would=20

be just the place where they would want to go if they had no money," came f=
rom Cora. "There are=20

so many chances to make money there."  "Perhaps they didn't dare go," sugge=
sted Belle.  "What=20

do you mean?" came in a duet from the others.  "They might have done someth=
ing--perhaps have=20

taken another auto--and they knew the police would be after them," explaine=

again in the car of the=20

Robinson twins. The girls had not left it all to the authorities to find th=
e missing automobile. They=20

had made diligent inquiries themselves on all roads leading out of Chelton =
and in the vicinity of the=20
