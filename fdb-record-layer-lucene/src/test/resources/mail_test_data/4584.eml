Salaam are short rivers, but, as they are the two main channels for the rec=

drainage of a vast mountain area, they bring down most violent floods, that=
 materially affect the=20

volume of the main artery.  The whole of this country abounded in game beyo=
nd any that I had=20

hitherto seen, and I had most glorious sport. Among the varieties of antelo=
pes, was a new species=20

that I had seen upon several occasions on the Settite, where it was extreme=

go and hold the horses. I'll soon bring you something to fasten the shaft t=

took the axe out of the tool-box under the coachman's seat, said a few word=
s to reassure the=20

ladies, and then jumped the ditch by the side of the road.  There were some=
 trees there, but they=20

were as rare as the hairs on the head of an old man. First came a birch, th=

then a black-thorn, then a bare piece of ground without any trees, and then=
 again a few old trees.=20

So it was rather difficult to find a=20

nearer than from 350=20

to 500 yards. This magnificent animal, the largest of all the antelopes of =
Abyssinia and Central=20

Africa, is known to the Arabs as the Maarif (Hippotragus Bakerii). It is a =
variety of the sable=20

antelope of South Africa (Hippotragus Niger). The colour is mouse-grey, wit=
h a black stripe across=20

the shoulders, and black and white lines across the nose and cheeks. The he=
ight at the shoulder=20

would exceed fourteen hands, and the neck is ornamented with a thick and st=
iff black mane. The=20

shoulders are peculiarly tree; one was too big, another too small; so Gyuri=
 went on and on in=20

search of one, and got so far that soon the carriage was out of sight, and =
only Veronica's red=20

sunshade was to be seen in the distance, like a large mushroom. At length h=
is eyes fell on a=20

young birch, which grew near to a small precipice. It was too big for a see=
dling and too small for a=20

tree, but well-grown and promising. All the same it must be sacrificed, and=
 down came the axe.=20

But hardly had two or three blows been struck, when a voice was heard, cryi=
ng out:  "Reta! Reta!"=20

(Help! Help!)  Gyuri started and turned round. Who had=20
