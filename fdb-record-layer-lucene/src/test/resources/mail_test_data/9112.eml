dracaena marginata state.  "Persis, how thankful I am that God had enabled =
me to forgive that man," said Ned Franks to his wife as they met. "Poor fel=
low! poor fellow! had he wronged me far more than he has done, I could feel=
 nothing but pity for him now. Let upon it, letting it remain in the Vinega=

eep him out; and make=20

us ready to forgive even as we have been forgiven!"  The husband and wife k=
nelt down side by=20

side, and silently poured out their confession of sin and prayer for help u=
nto Him who could himself=20

pardon his murderers. Night darkened around as they prayed; and with the ni=
ght came a rush of=20

refreshing rain after the fervent heat of the long summer day.  When Franks=
 arose from his knees=20

his manner was calmer and more subdued.  "Persis," he said, after he had re=
sumed his seat,=20

"God has been showing me my weakness. I cannot by myself subdue the fierce =
passions within;=20

but he can, and he will send his Spirit, even as he sends his rain from hea=
ven to quench the fire,=20

and calm the proud, resentful spirit! I have made one resolution,--and may =
God help me to keep=20

it!--never, if possible, even to name Sir Lacy, except in my prayers. Yes, =
Persis, you and I will not=20

harbor malice and hatred as guests, but resist them as foes; and, to gain s=
trength for the struggle,=20

you and I will to-morrow seek the Lord in his own ordinance by the bedside =
of our poor dying=20

friend."     XXXVII.  The Sudden Summons.   On the following morning Franks=
 started before=20

breakfast for a spot called Cliff Farm, to make arrangements with the owner=
 of the place for the=20

loan of his cart to carry the school-master's family, and what little lugga=
ge they possessed, to the=20

station on the succeeding Thursday. The errand was not a pleasant one, but =
Franks had no longer=20

the heavy weight on his heart which had oppressed him so long as he felt th=
at, not being in charity=20

with man, he could not be at peace with his God. Franks could now look calm=
ly up at the clear=20

blue sky, flecked with rosy morning clouds, with a spirit in harmony with t=
he tranquil, holy beauty of=20

nature.  Cliff Farm owed its name to but is likely to be Viviparous, as I h=
ave mention'd in the Month=20

of _January_. The Jack, or Pike, this Month runs, as the Sportsmen call it;=
 that is, they retire into=20

the Ditches, if there are any in their way, and feed upon Frogs; or else, i=
n warm Days, lie upon the=20

top of the Waters, and are easily taken by Snares: However, they are this M=
onth full row'd, and=20

are then in their greatest Strength, and in the best condition for the Tabl=
e. We judge those are the=20

best which are broad-back'd, and deep Fish; for those that are long and sle=
nder, have not their=20

Flesh firm, which is reckon'd the Perfection of a Fish. The way of preparin=
g this Fish in the best=20

manner, in my Opinion, if it is large, is to roast it according to the foll=
owing Receipt, which I had=20

from Mr. _John Hughs_, an excellent Cook in _London_.  When a Jack or Pike =
is discharged of its=20

Scales and Entrails, and well clean'd, prepare a Mixture in the following M=
anner, to be sew'd up in=20

the Belly of the Fish: Take of grated Bread about one third part, the Rivet=
, or Liver of the Fish cut=20

small, with Oysters chopped, or the Flesh of Eels cut small; mix these with=
 three or four Eggs=20

butter'd in a Sauce-pan, to which add Pepper and Salt with some dry'd Sweet=
 Marjoram well=20

pouder'd, or such other Sweet-herbs as are most grateful to the Palate, an =
Anchovy shred small,=20

and fill the Belly of the Fish with the Preparation, and sew it up. When th=
is is done, cut two small=20

Laths of Willow, or any other Wood, except Deal, or such as has a Turpentin=
e Juice in it, of the=20

length of the Fish, and lay the Fish upon the Spit, with the two Laths upon=
 the Fish, and bind them=20

together with a Fillet of Linnen, about an Inch wide, which must be wrapp'd=
 round them in a=20

Screw-like manner, and then laid down to the Fire, and basted very well wit=
h Butter, and drudged=20

with Crumbs of Bread, and the same sort of=20

and was approached by a road steep enough to try the breath and mettle of a=
ny horse drawing a=20

conveyance. On one side, not a hundred yards to the right of the farm-house=
, there was an abrupt=20

fall of the ground, forming a sheer perpendicular descent of some fifty or =
sixty feet, down which=20

tumbled a light sparkling cascade. It was the joyous leap of the young stre=
am which, not a mile=20

lower down, turned the wheel of the mill, after winding its way past the vi=
llage of Colme. The=20

brook, rushing with a pleasant gurgling sound over its rocky bed, added to =
the charm of the spot,=20

which was one of the loveliest in Where you have not the conveniency of Oys=
ters, or Eels, to=20

compose the aforemention'd Mixture, you may add a larger quantity of butter=
'd Eggs. Where there=20

is the conveniency of an Oven, we may bake such a Fish with less trouble th=
an roasting it; and in=20

that case rub the outside with the Yolk of an Egg, and roll it in some of t=
he Mixture=20

abovemention'd, the Anchovy and butter'd Eggs excepted, putting some Vinega=
r and Butter in the=20

Pan. The Sauce to this Fish is Butter melted, a little White-wine, and mix'=
d with a third part of=20

season'd Beef Gravy, with a Spoonful or two of Mushroom Ketchup, and an Anc=
hovy or=20


_
Franks had often bent his steps towards Cliff Farm, and stood on the edge o=
f that steep, rocky=20

bank, to enjoy the extensive view which it commanded.  And there the school=
-master now lingered=20

to gaze, perhaps for the last time, from that point on the beautiful landsc=
ape before him. There lay=20

beneath him the village of Colme, the ivy-mantled church in which he had be=
en married to Persis,=20

and to which they had brought their first-born babe to offer him unto the L=
ord. There was the dear=20

little school-house, at once the scene of Franks's earliest labors, and the=
 home in which he had=20

known more of pure happiness than falls to the lot of most men, even during=
 the longest life. The=20

eye of the school-master wandered along the high road leading towards the t=
own; his gaze=20

lingered on the cottage of Nancy Sands; never would he remember that dwelli=
ng and its inmates=20

but with feelings of thankful joy. Then the glance of Franks fell on the ch=
imneys of Stone's house;=20

trees intervening hid the rest of the building from his view; there the one=
-armed sailor had sought=20

faithfully, and not unsuccessfully, to open blinded eyes to the truth. Fart=
her on--how well Franks=20

knew its position!--lay the wooded dell in which Persis had dwelt when he w=
ooed her, and where=20

he had first met with Isaacs, then an unconverted Jew,--now, partly through=
 his words, his prayers,=20

his example, a consistent Christian believer. The little stream plunging ov=
er the cliff, which was=20

almost at the feet of Ned Franks, was the same from which--by the mill in t=
hat same wooded dell--

he had drawn the drowning Nancy at the imminent peril of his life. The pine=
s on yon eastern hill=20

looked down, as the school-master well knew, on the almshouses nestling in =
Wild Rose Hollow.=20

How greatly would he be missed there! If that thought was sad, it also was =
sweet. There would be=20

many a tear shed by aged eyes in those cottages which he had labored so har=
d to repair. Ned=20

sighed to think that his work there must be left unfinished.  Still farther=
 on roved the eye of Franks.=20

On another hill, girdled with woods, stood the Hall; he could see its upper=
 windows glancing in the=20

light of the morning sun.  "O God! Thy blessing may yet rest on that dark p=
lace--as it seems to us,"=20

said the school-master half aloud. "Thou sendest thy sunshine to all, so ma=
y none be shut out=20

from thy grace. It seems to me at this moment as if I could forgive from my=
 soul even Sir Lacy=20

Barton."  As Ned pursued his meditations, suddenly he was startled by a cry=
 of "Stop him! stop=20

him!" from behind, with the sound of the clattering hoofs of a horse rushin=
g on in wild, frantic=20

career down the steep slope just above the spot on which Franks was standin=
g. Turning quickly=20

round, he beheld a black hunter dashing towards him at a furious speed, whi=
ch its rider, tugging at=20

the rein, tried in vein to check, as his horse was carrying him direct towa=
rds the cliff and--unless it=20

were possible to stop his career--to inevitable destruction! Franks had but=
 an instant to calculate=20

chances, to recognize the rider, to resolve to try to save him by catching =
at the rein as the=20

maddened hunter rushed like a whirlwind by! Franks made the attempt, but fa=
iled, and was struck=20

to the earth with violence! The hand of no single man would have sufficed t=
o stop the furious and=20

powerful animal which the baronet rode. Ned instantly sprang to his feet, a=
nd, as he did so, saw=20

the fearful plunge over the cliff, and heard the wild cry for help from one=
 beyond all human help.=20

Then followed a terrible crash below!  "He's lost!" exclaimed the owner of =
Cliff Farm, who came=20

panting up to the spot, followed by one of his men, who had also witnessed =
the frightful=20

catastrophe, and Ned's gallant though fruitless effort to avert it.  "Let's=
 make our way down without=20

a moment's delay!" cried Ned; "he may be living still!"  The three men, Fra=
nks the foremost of the=20

party, with all speed clambered to the bottom of the cliff, at a place wher=
e a little roughness in the=20

ground, and a few bushes to hold by, enabled them to manage the descent. I =
will not dwell on the=20



fearful sight which awaited them. The black horse lay dead, the rider appar=
ently dying. Franks took=20

the lead in doing all that could be done for the sufferer. One messenger wa=
s sent off to the Hall,=20

another to the town for a surgeon. There was no difficulty in finding messe=
ngers, for country=20

people, who had seen the horse when it first started off, now came running =
to the scene of the=20

disaster.  With all the tenderness that he could have shown to  The smaller=
 Sort of these Fish,=20

_i.e._ such as are about a Foot long, are most commonly boiled, but they wi=
ll do well baked, as=20

above directed. The same Sauce may be used with the boil'd Fish; or instead=
 of Beef Gravy, may=20

be used the Mushroom Gravy, as directed in this Work, which will have a muc=
h finer Relish than=20

the Beef Gravy.  In this Month likewise, the Carp is fit for the Table, and=
 is commonly much=20

admir'd, if it be well stew'd; otherwise I think it makes but an indifferen=
t Dish, being a Fish full of=20

Cross-bones. The Head is accounted much the best part of the Fish, and is t=
herefore presented as=20

a Compliment to the greatest Stranger at the Table. The Carp, as it is a Fi=
sh which thrives best in=20

black, deep, standing Waters, is therefore commonly given to taste of the M=
ud; but to cure this,=20

those Carps you intend for the Table should be put into a clear Water for a=
 Week before you use=20

them, that they may purge themselves. You may keep two Brace of large Carps=
 well enough in a=20

two-dozen Hamper, plung'd into any part of a River where there is a clear S=
tream, or Trench that=20

is fed by a Spring, and they will become of an extraordinary sweet Taste. A=
nd so we may do with=20

Tench and Eels, when we catch them in foul feeding Waters. When your Fish a=
re thus purify'd,=20

dress your Carps after the following manner:    To Stew Carps or Tench.  Ta=
ke a Brace of live=20

Carp, scale them, gut and wash them, and bleed them in the Tails, so that t=
he Blood be not lost;=20

for according to all the Receipts for stewing this kind of Fish, the Blood,=
 however small the=20

Quantity is of it, must make part of the Sauce: Lay these in a Stew-Pan wit=
h the Blood, a Pint of=20

Beef-Gravy, a Pint of Claret, a large Onion stuck with Cloves, three large =
Anchovies, a Stick of=20

Horse-radish sliced, the Peel of half a large Lemon, Pepper and Salt at ple=
asure, a Bunch of=20

Sweet-herbs, two or three Spoonfuls of Vinegar. This Liquor should nearly c=
over the Carps; so=20

that if the Gravy and Claret, mention'd above, be not sufficient, add equal=
 quantities of each till you=20

have enough; cover this close, and set the Stew-pan over a gentle Fire, til=
l the lower-side of the=20

Fish are stew'd enough; then turn them, and keep them stewing as before, cl=
ose cover'd, till they=20

are enough; after which, lay them in a Dish upon Sippets of fry'd Bread, an=
d strain off the Sauce to=20

be thicken'd and brown'd with burnt Butter. This must be poured over the Fi=
sh, and the Dish=20

garnish'd with the Row or Milt, Barberries, and Lemons sliced.  The same Me=
thod is also used for=20

stewing of large Roach, Dace, and Chubb; but a Tench stew'd this way, is mu=
ch better than a=20

Carp, The Back of this Fish, and the Head, are the Pieces which are most in=
 esteem.  It is worth=20

our remark, that when we find our Tench cover'd with black Scales, they Wil=
l always taste muddy,=20

which is the fault of the River-Tench about _Cambridge_; but where we find =
Tench of a golden=20

Colour, we are sure of good Fish, that will eat sweet without the trouble o=
f putting 'em into clear=20

Water to purify.  As there is some trouble in the dressing of this Fish, th=
ey may be stew'd the Night=20

before they are to be eaten, and will keep very well; and half an hour befo=
re they are to be serv'd=20

up, set them over the Fire to be thoroughly hot, and then brown their Sauce=
 as before directed.  It=20

is to be observ'd, that to bake these Fish with the above Ingredients is as=
 good a Way as the=20

stewing them. It is likewise necessary to observe, that all Fish which will=
 keep a long time alive out=20

of Water, will sicken, and their Flesh become unfirm by lying in the Air; t=
herefore, if Fish are to be=20



sent a Day's Journey, or kept a Day before they are used, kill them as soon=
 as they are taken out=20

of the Water, and the Flesh will be firm.  I shall add one thing more conce=
rning the boiling of Fish,=20

which was communicated to me by a very ingenious Gentleman, who has made Fi=
shing his Study=20

for many Years: He says, that the Goodness of boil'd Fish consists chiefly =
in the Firmness of the=20

Flesh; and in the next place, that the Flesh parts easily from the Bone; to=
 do which, he directs to=20

kill the Fish immediately after they are taken out of the Water; and when y=
ou design to boil 'em,=20

put a large handful of Salt into about two or three quarts of Water, and so=
 in proportion: Put in the=20

Fish while the Water is cold; then set them over the Fire, and make them bo=
il as quick as possible,=20

without any Cover over the Pan. This is approved to do very well. This Rece=
ipt is particularly good=20

for boiling of Flounders. His=20


_
friend, Ned helped to place the crushed and senseless Sir Lacy upon a shutt=
er, and to carry him=20

by a steep path which wound up the cliff at a little distance from the casc=
ade, to the shelter of Cliff=20

Farm. Franks did not quit him till his own people, summoned hastily from th=
e Hall, were around=20

him, and amongst them the school-master-elect. Then, as he could be of no f=
arther use, Ned=20

Franks, thoughtful and grave, returned to his home. He found his pupils alr=
eady assembled. Of=20

course the tidings of the accident to Sir Lacy Barton were on every one's l=
ips, and the boys=20

awaited from their master an account of all that had happened, perhaps with=
 such boil'd Fish, is=20

the following.    Sauce for boil'd Fish.  Take Beef-Gravy, an Onion, a litt=
le White-wine, some=20

Horse-radish sliced, Lemon-peel, an Anchovy, a Bunch of Sweet-herbs, boil t=
hem well together,=20

and strain off the Liquor, then put a Spoonful of Mushroom Ketchup to it, a=
nd thicken it with Butter=20

mix'd with Flower: or for Fast-days the Gravy may be omitted, and in the pl=
ace of it put Mushroom-

Gravy, or a larger quantity of Mushroom-Ketchup, or some of the Fish-Gravy =
mention'd in=20

_February_, which is good to put in Sauce for any sort of Fish.  As this is=
 the Month when Eels=20

begin to be good, I shall give two or three Receipts for the=20


_
upon a wicked man might call forth from their teacher.  But Franks was not =
one to condemn a poor=20

sinner already under the chastening of Heaven, nor to gratify private malic=
e under the pretence of=20

enforcing a lesson. He was much more grave and serious than usual, but avoi=
ded making any=20

allusion to the fate of his persecutor, though the awful scene which he had=
 witnessed was the=20

uppermost thought in his mind. It was a relief to Roasting of Eels, or Pitc=
hcotting them, I had from=20

the Crown at _Basingstoke_ some Years ago; and that for Collaring of Eels, =
from Mr. _John=20

Hughs_, a celebrated Cook in _London_. But I shall first observe, that the =
Silver Eel is counted the=20

best; and that all such as lie and feed in clear Streams, may be used witho=
ut purging them, as I=20

have directed above; but all Pond Eels must be put into clear Waters for a =
Week, at least,=20


_
pupils dispersed, and he was able to go to his own quiet room, where Persis=
 was anxiously=20

awaiting him. She, of course, like every one else in Colme, knew what had o=
ccurred, and knew,=20

also, that the baronet had by this time been conveyed to the Hall, where he=
 lay in a very to the=20
