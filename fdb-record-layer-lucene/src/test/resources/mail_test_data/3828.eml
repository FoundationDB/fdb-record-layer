even Mr Sparks was solemnised by the supposition that he was in the presence of Death.  "Oh, 

Ned, Ned!" exclaimed Maggie, unable to repress her grief, "can you--can you ever forgive me?" 

She laid her hand on the fireman's broad breast, and passionately kissed his brow.  He opened his 

eyes, and whispered with difficulty, "Forgive you, Maggie? God for ever bless you."  He could say 

no more, owing to excessive weakness.  "Come, missus, you mustn't disturb him," said David 

Clazie, emerging from behind the curtains at the foot of the bed.  "The doctor's orders was strict--

to keep 'im quiet.  You'd better go into the other room, an' your brother likewise.  Pr'aps you might 

send 'im to tell Joe Dashwood to be ready."  David Clazie, who was more a man of action than of 

words, quietly, but firmly, ejected the brother and sister

and, having shut the door, sat down at his post again as a guard over his sick comrade.  "Seems 

to me it's all up with 'im," observed Sparks, as he stood gazing uneasily into the fire.  As Mrs 

Crashington replied only by sobbing, he continued, after a few minutes--  "Does the doctor say it's 

all up, Mag?"  "No, oh no," replied the poor woman, "he don't quite say so; but I can't git no 

comfort from that.  Ned has lost _such_ a quantity of blood, it seems impossible for him to git 

round.  They're goin' to try a operation on 'im to-day, but I can't understand it, an' don't believe in it. 

They talk of puttin' noo blood into 'im!  An' that reminds me that the doctor is to be here at twelve. 

Do run round, Phil, to the Dashwoods, and tell Joe to be here in good time."  "What's Joe wanted 

for?"  "Never mind, but go and tell him that.  I can't talk just now," she said, pushing her brother out 

of the room.  Tapping at Joe Dashwood's door, Phil received from a strong, deep voice permission 

to "come in."  He entered, and found a very different state of things from that which he had just 

left.  A bright room, and bright, happy faces.  The windows were bright, which made the light 

appear brighter than usual; the grate was bright; the furniture was bright; the face of the clock, 

whose interior seemed about to explode on every occasion of striking the hour, was bright--almost 

to smiling; and the pot-lids, dish-covers, etcetera, were bright--so bright as to be absolutely 

brilliant.  Joe Dashwood and his little wife were conversing near the window, but, although their 

faces were unquestionably bright by reason of contentment, coupled with a free use of soap and 

the jack-towel, there

Nothing of the sort, however, appeared on the countenances of the Rosebud and young Fred 

Crashington.  These gushing little offshoots of the Red Brigade were too young to realise the 

danger of Ned's condition, but they were quite old enough to create an imaginary fire in the 

cupboard, which they were wildly endeavouring to extinguish with a poker for a "branch" and a 

bucket for a fire-engine, when Mr Sparks entered.  "Oh! kik, Feddy, kik; put it out kik, or

payments      must be paid cried little May, eagerly, as she tossed back a cataract of golden curls 

from her flushed countenance, and worked away at the handle of the bucket with all her might. 

"All right!" shouted Fred, who had been sent to play with the Rosebud that he might be out of the 

way.  "Down with Number 1; that's your sort; keep 'er goin'; hooray!"  He brought the poker down 

with an awful whack on the cupboard at this point, causing the crockery to rattle again.  "Hallo! 

youngster, mind what you're about," cried Joe, "else there will be more damage caused by the 

engine than the fire--not an uncommon thing, either, in our practice!"  It was at this point that he 

replied to Mr Sparks's knock.  "Come in, Mr Sparks, you've heard of your poor brother-in-law's 

accident, I suppose?"  "Yes, I've just comed from his house with a message.  You're wanted to be 

there in good time."  "All right, I'll be up to time," said Joe, putting on his coat and cap, and smiling 

to his wife, as he added, "It's a queer sort o' thing to do. We'll be blood-relations, Ned and I, after 

this.  Look after these youngsters, Molly, else they'll knock your crockery to bits.  Good-day. Mr 

Sparks."  "Good-day," replied Sparks, as Joe went out.  Then, turning to Mrs Dashwood, "What 

sort of operation is it they're goin' to perform on Ned?"  "Did you not hear?  It's a very curious one. 

Ned has lost so much blood from a deep cut in his leg that the doctors say he can't recover, no 

matter how strong his constitution is, unless he gits some blood put into him, so they're goin' to put 

some o' my Joe's blood into him."

No, no, I've got a pretty big swallow, but I can't git _that_ down."  "If you can't swallow it you'll have 

to bolt it, then, for it's a fact," returned Mary, with a laugh.  "But how do they mean to go about it?" 

asked Sparks, with an unbelieving expression of countenance.  "Well, I ain't quite sure about that," 

replied Mary; "they say that the doctor cuts a hole in a vein of the arms of both men, and puts a 

pipe, or something of that sort, into the two veins, and so
