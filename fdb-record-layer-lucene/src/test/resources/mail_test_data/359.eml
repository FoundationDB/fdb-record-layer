metaphor, till he made it burn in the ears of the people. And then he told =
them of the Last Day,=20

when a just reckoning should be taken of the deeds they had done; and he sp=
oke of Paradise and=20

Hell with all the glow of Eastern imagery. The people were moved, terrified=
; conversions=20

increased. It was time the Kureysh should take some step. If the idols were=
 destroyed, what would=20

come to them, the keepers of the idols, and their renown throughout the lan=
d? How should they=20

retain the allegiance of the neighbouring tribes who came to worship their =
several divinities at the=20

Kaabeh? That a few should follow the ravings of a madman or magician who pr=
eferred one god=20

above the beautiful deities of Mekka was little matter; but that some leadi=
ng men of the city should=20

join the sect, and that the magician should terrify the people in open day =
with his denunciations of=20

the worship which _they_ superintended, was intolerable. The chiefs were se=
riously alarmed, and=20

resolved on a more active policy. Hitherto they had merely ridiculed the pr=
ofessors of this new=20

faith; they would now take stronger measures. Mohammad himself they dared n=
ot touch; for he=20

belonged to a noble family, which, though it was reduced and impoverished, =
had deserved well of=20

the city, and which, gradually to the shore, with grass and moss covering t=
he bold face of the rock.=20

=E2=80=9CTake your time,=E2=80=9D Father Buck cautioned. =E2=80=9CMeasure t=

you=E2=80=99re sure of yourself. Many a buck that failed the first time nev=
er got his courage up to repeat it.=20

It is the first leap that counts.=E2=80=9D  Reflecting long and earnestly o=
n his father=E2=80=99s words, White Tail=20

measured the distance with his eyes, and then drew back as far as he could.=
 He gathered his=20

powerful hind legs together, squatted down on them, pawed the rock with his=
 front ones, and stood=20

a moment in trembling anticipation. His nostrils dilated, his eyes flashed.=
 Then with a sudden=20

forward spring he darted toward the edge of the rock, and when he reached i=
t his hind hoofs dug=20

on the rock for a secure purchase. There was a momentary hesitation, as if =
he had decided not to=20

make the attempt. Then his body shot upward and outward across the brook in=
 the prettiest jump=20

that any deer had ever taken.  He cleared the brook, with its stepping ston=
es, passed the opposite=20

edge, and landed all four hoofs firmly planted on the upper part of the slo=
pe. He had made the=20

jump successfully.  Father Buck crossed the stream on the stones, and glanc=
ed down at his old=20

mark. A spirit of exultation=20


_
now headed by a man who was reverenced throughout Mekka, and was none other=
 than the=20

adoptive father and protector of Mohammad himself. Nor was it safe to attac=
k the other chief men=20

among the Muslims, for the blood-revenge was no light risk. They were thus =
compelled to content=20

themselves with the mean satisfaction of torturing the black slaves who had=
 joined the obnoxious=20

faction. They exposed them on the scorching sand, and withheld water till t=
hey recanted--which=20

they did, only to profess the faith once  =E2=80=9CYou have passed my old m=
ark, White Tail, beaten it by a=20

=9D  White Tail was as much interested as his=20

father in his triumph. He examined the marks, and then wanted to repeat the=
 jump to see if he=20

could better it.  =E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D cautioned Father Buck, =E2=80=9Conc=
e is sufficient. The second time may not be so=20

others. Let Young Black Buck beat it if he can. Until he does=20
