 but happy was the man who was privileged even to endure the awful test. It=
 _
place was well chosen. There was not a soul about. Barbiche, his face still=
 very pale, dressed in=20

spotless black, in his button-hole the red ribbon, so dear to every Frenchm=
an's heart, and=20

accompanied by his friend De Kerguel, stepped out. They were followed by a =
little dried-up Italian=20

army surgeon, who carried under his arm an ominous-looking black case. They=
 made for the=20

miller's orchard at once.  They were not destined to be kept in suspense, f=
or Haggard and his=20

party had preceded them. All three Englishmen, Haggard, the general and Lor=
d Spunyarn, were=20

attired in ordinary walking dress; the general and Spunyarn advanced to mee=
t De Kerguel.=20

Barbiche and the surgeon remained a little apart.  "Gentlemen," said De Ker=
guel, as he=20

courteously raised his hat, "we owe you an apology."  General Pepper's rudd=
y face assumed a=20

purple hue. "Did these fellows mean to cry off after all?" But he was soon =
reassured.  "We have=20

thought it northern castle, and speculating on their return to London, whic=
h was to take place after=20

the Easter which had just arrived. It was an important social season for Co=
risande, for she was to=20

be formally introduced into the great world, and to be presented at court. =
 In the mean while, was=20

there any truth in the report about Lothair?  After their meeting at their =
lawyer=E2=80=99s, a certain intimacy=20

had occurred between the cardinal and his ward. They met again immediately =
and frequently, and=20

their mutual feelings were cordial. The manners of his eminence were refine=
d and affectionate; his=20

conversational powers were distinguished; there was not a subject on which =
his mind did not teem=20

with interesting suggestions; his easy knowledge seemed always ready and al=
ways full; and=20

whether it were art, or letters, or manners, or even political affairs, Lot=
hair seemed to listen to one=20

of the wisest, most enlightened, and most agreeable of men.=20


_
mixing up any one else in this unfortunate affair. Hence, gentlemen, we hav=
e dispensed with the=20

usual second _temoin_. Dr. Battista, of the Papal Zouaves, is present. We h=
ad better perhaps lose=20

no time."  "Be good enough," said the general, "to look at these." And from=
 under his blue military=20

on which his eminence seemed scrupulous never to touch, and that was religi=
on; or so indirectly,=20

that it was only when alone that Lothair frequently found himself musing ov=

regulation sabres, perhaps a little exceeding the ordinary length. They wer=
e heavy, murderous-

looking weapons.  "I cannot object, gentlemen," said the Frenchman, as he c=
arefully measured=20

them and weighed them in either hand. "But----" here he eloquently shrugged=
 his shoulders.  The=20

expectant adversaries lost no time. They divested themselves of their coats=
 and vests, and, bare-

headed, each advanced to receive his weapon.  The general traced two lines =
on the dusty earth,=20

about eight feet apart. Barbiche and Haggard took their places. The old gen=
eral stood between=20

them, but a little to one side; he held his stick, with the point raised a =
little from the ground, ready=20

to dash aside the blades the instant that blood should be drawn.  "_En gard=
e, messieurs_,"=20

exclaimed De Kerguel.  the cardinal presented Lothair to Lady St. Jerome. T=
he impassioned=20

eloquence of that lady germinated the seed which the cardinal had seemed so=
 carelessly to=20

scatter. She was a woman to inspire crusaders. Not that she ever: condescen=
ded to vindicate her=20

own particular faith, or spoke as if she were conscious that Lothair did no=
t possess it. Assuming=20

that religion was true, for otherwise man would be in a more degraded posit=
ion than the beasts of=20

the field, which are not aware of their own wretchedness, then religion sho=
uld be the principal=20

occupation of man, to which all other pursuits should be subservient. The d=
oom of eternity, and=20

the fortunes of life, cannot be placed in competition. Our days should be p=
ure, and holy, and=20

heroic=E2=80=94full of noble thoughts and solemn sacrifice.=20
