a certain place, its velocity was greatly accelerated, and it was with feel=
ings of alarm that I saw the cab, evidently from its luggage fresh from the=
 railway, entered the court-yard of Hexham House, of which the shuttered wi=

and horror I remarked that some wretches who had been here before me, had p=
artly stripped the=20

bodies of the lady and others in their search after plunder, besides riflin=
g the contents of some=20

cases of valuables, which had been put into the boat. I hastily turned towa=
rds the principal scene=20

of disaster, and addressed myself to one of the survivors, whom I found to =
be the supercargo. The=20

vessel was _La Bonne Esperance_ of Brest, of 550 tons, homeward bound, with=
 a mixed cargo of=20

rum, cotton, and colonial produce, from the West Indies. It appeared that t=
he captain, mate, and=20

passengers had left the ship just as she struck, and taken to the long boat=
, the fatal result of which=20

has been seen. As I surmised, the bodies I had seen consisted of one family=
, the only passengers=20

on board, a colonel in the army, with his son and daughter, returning to hi=
s country after long=20

service in foreign parts. The supercargo, in the confusion which took place=
, could not get into the=20

long boat the field. Yes,=E2=80=9D she added, with energy, =E2=80=9Cwe coul=
d sweep them from the face of the=20

earth!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut the army of Italy,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=

odora. =E2=80=9CThat=20

has been our stumbling-block. I have always known that, if ever the French =
quitted Rome, it would=20

be on the understanding that the house of Savoy should inherit the noble of=
fice of securing our=20

servitude. He in whom I alone confide would never credit this; but my infor=
mation, in this respect,=20

was authentic. However, it is no longer necessary to discuss the question. =
News has come, and in=20

no uncertain shape, that whatever may have been the understanding, under no=
 circumstances will=20

the Italian army enter the Roman state. We must strike, therefore, and Rome=
 will be free. But how=20

am I to strike? We have neither money nor arms. We have only men. I can giv=
e them no more,=20

because I have already given them every thing, except my life, which is alw=
ays theirs. As for my=20

husband, who, I may=20


_
rest of the crew on board; several of the seamen were washed off the decks =
and dashed against=20

the rocks, and my narrator and three others were all that survived "to tell=
 the tale."  The ship's hull=20

lay jammed between two small rocks near the foot of the cliffs; she was sti=
ll almost outwardly=20

entire, as the tide receded just after she came ashore in the night; but th=
ere was a hole knocked in=20

her side from whence a portion of the cargo had been washed out. The two pr=
incipal masts had=20

gone by the board, but a part of the mizen-mast was still standing; and the=
 rocks were covered, far=20

and near, with tattered portions of her sails and cordage pasted against th=
eir sides, disposed by=20

the sea, in a grotesque manner.  As the principal station of battle-field, =
so far as wealth was=20

concerned, he was then a prince among princes, and would pour forth his tre=
asure, and his life,=20

with equal eagerness. But things have changed since Aspromonte. The struggl=
e in his own=20

country has entirely deprived him of revenues as great as any forfeited by =
their Italian princelings.=20

In fact, it is only by a chance that he is independent. Had it not been for=
 an excellent man, one of=20

your great English merchants, who was his agent here, and managed his affai=
rs, we should have=20

been penniless. His judicious investments of the superfluity of our income,=
 which, at the time, my=20

husband never even noticed, have secured for Colonel Campian the means of t=
hat decorous life=20

which he appreciates=E2=80=94but no more. As=20


_
distance, some time would elapse before they could lend their aid in the pr=
otection of the property;=20

and the mob from the neighbouring country, disappointed at finding little e=
lse but broken crockery=20

at the other wreck, seemed disposed to make the most of their time, and wer=
e proceeding with all=20

the violence and rapacity of professed wreckers. In spite of the exertions =
of the officer from=20

Torwich and his assistants, they were mounting the sides, and had spread th=
emselves over the=20

vessel like a pack of hungry wolves on the dead carcass of a horse, when I =
arrived. A scene of=20

greater confusion and singularity cannot be described.  It was not long bef=
ore their attention was=20

awakened by the tapping of a cask of rum, which with many more had been was=
hed out of the=20

hold. This beverage presented a powerful attraction; the ship was soon, in =
some measure,=20

deserted, and the mob concentrated like a swarm of wasps round the casks. A=
ll distinctions were=20

now at an end; the better sort of farmer or shopkeeper, scrambled with the =
pauper for a cup or cap=20

(or shoe) full of the mellow liquid; while the supercargo and his men, aide=
d by myself and a few=20

others, were occupied in hastily putting into some carts the more valuable =
articles rescued from=20

plunder. As the parties had been immoderate in their potations, so the effe=
cts were equally=20

speedy. Women lay on the sand, dead drunk, beside the booty they had collec=
ted, while unable to=20

stir, it was snatched from their powerless grasp by others stronger or more=
 sober than=20

considerations are nothing. I will not say I should be insensible to a refi=
ned life with refined=20

companions, if the spirit were content and the heart serene; but I never co=
uld fully realize the=20

abstract idea of what they call wealth; I never could look upon it except a=
s a means to an end, and=20

my end has generally been military material. Perhaps the vicissitudes of my=
 life have made me=20

insensible to what are called reverses of fortune, for, when a child, I rem=
ember sleeping on the=20

moonlit flags of Paris, with no pillow except my tambourine; and I remember=
 it not without delight.=20

Let us sit down. I feel I am talking in an excited, injudicious, egotistica=
l, rhapsodical, manner. I=20

thought I was calm, and I meant to have been clear. But the fact is, I am a=
shamed of myself. I am=20

doing a wrong thing, and in a wrong manner. But I have had a sleepless nigh=
t, and a day of=20

brooding thought. I meant once to have asked you to help me, and now I feel=
 that you are the last=20

person to whom I ought to appeal.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIn that you are in err=
or,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, rising and taking her=20

hand with an expression of much gravity; =E2=80=9CI am the right person for=
 you to appeal to=E2=80=94the only=20

person.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNay,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, and she shook her h=
ead.  =E2=80=9CFor I owe to you a debt that I never can=20

repay,=E2=80=9D continued Lothair. =E2=80=9CHad it not been for you, I shou=
ld have remained what I was when we=20

first met, a prejudiced, narrow-minded being, with contracted sympathies an=
d false knowledge,=20

wasting my life on obsolete trifles, and utterly insensible to the privileg=
e=20


_
taking place, both amongst boys and men, which generally terminated by each=
 of the combatants=20

falling prostrate martyrs to Bacchus. The infection was universal, and even=
 the three "mounseers,"=20

the surviving crew of the Bonne Esperance, could not resist an occasional s=
ly pull at the liquor.=20

These men, though they had only just escaped sudden death, seemed not to be=
 cast down; but=20

with their characteristic agility, one minute assisted to roll the casks in=
to carts, and then ran off=20

perhaps to whisper a compliment to some pretty girl, shrugging up their sho=
ulders at the=20

unceremonious repulse they met with from _mademoiselle_.  But this progress=
. Why, had it not=20

been for you I should have at this very moment been lavishing my fortune on=
 an ecclesiastical toy,=20

which I think of with a blush. There may be=E2=80=94doubtless there are=E2=
=80=94opinions in which we may not=20

agree; but in our love of truth and justice there is no difference, dearest=
 lady. No; though you must=20

have felt that I am not=E2=80=94that no one could be=E2=80=94insensible to =
your beauty and infinite charms, still it=20

is your consummate character that has justly fascinated my thought and hear=
t; and I have long=20

resolved, were I permitted, to devote to you my fortune and my life.=E2=80=
