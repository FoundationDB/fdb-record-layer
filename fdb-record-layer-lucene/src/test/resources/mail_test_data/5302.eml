cannot recover the sword sufficiently quick to parry, therefore they are co=

their only guard. If opposed to a good swordsman they would be perfectly at=
 his mercy, as a feint=20

at the head causes them to raise the shield; this prevents them from seeing=
 the point, that would=20

immediately pass through the body.  Notwithstanding their deficiency in the=
 art of the sword, they=20

are wonderful fellows to cut and slash; and when the sharp edge of the heav=

enemy, the effect is terrible.  The elephant-hunters, or aggageers, exhibit=
