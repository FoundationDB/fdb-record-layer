  A harsh, bitter laugh, from=20

it. He announced the fact in his last bulletin.=E2=80=9D  Henri stirred une=
asily, and cast a mournful glance=20

around him. All that met his senses was foul and loathsome in the extreme. =
The atmosphere of the=20

place was =E2=80=9Cat once icy and pestilential;=E2=80=9D and the whole, th=
e sick, the dying, and the dead, lay=20

heaped together promiscuously. Dead bodies, or mutilated portions of them, =
were piled together in=20

the windows, a ghastly defence against the bitter wintry wind; while every =
noxious odour, every=20

hideous and revolting sight that accompanies disease and death, filled the =
vaults and corridors of=20

the spacious building, making it one vast and dreary charnel-house.  =E2=80=
=9CThis is horrible!=E2=80=9D he=20

murmured.  =E2=80=9CNothing could be worse. No beds--no straw even--no fire=

for us, hundreds of famished wretches are brought in here every day, until =
there is no more room=20

in which to lay them down to die. This building which is now our prison, th=

=9D  Henri covered his face. He was=20

utterly crushed. He seemed no longer to feel, to care for anything--a numb =
chill despair lay like a=20

weight of lead upon his heart.  After what might have been, for aught he kn=
ew, a considerable=20

time, he was aroused from his stupor by the sound of voices, and interested=
, in spite of himself, by=20

what reached his ear. Some one was pleading earnestly with another in the a=
ccents of a soft=20

musical tongue, which at first he took for Italian, like Guido=E2=80=99s, b=
ut he soon found that he could not=20

understand the words spoken. However, the speakers presently relapsed into =
French, and then he=20

easily gathered that one of them, a Spaniard, dying of the cruel hospital f=
ever, was entreating his=20

French comrade to write for him a letter of farewell to his wife. Evidently=
 the feelings of the=20

Frenchman were touched. Henri saw him tear a leaf from a book which he had =
with him, and write=20

upon it at the dictation of the Spaniard, and in his language. =E2=80=9CTho=
ugh where is the use?=E2=80=9D he heard=20

=E2=80=9CThe Emperor is come,=E2=80=9D said Pontet. In that word there was =
