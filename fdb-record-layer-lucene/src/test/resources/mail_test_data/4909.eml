s.  "When it comes to the real fine-haired work, you have us all feeling fo=
r hand-holds, Mr. McVickar," he said. "Now I know Chaldees.' It was and is =

away and carried out his original intention of going to the Inter-Mountain =
and to bed.  To bed; but,=20

for a long hour after the post-midnight quiet had settled down upon the gre=
at hostelry, not to sleep.=20

If he had asked himself why he could not close his eyes and take the needed=
 rest, the exciting=20

incident in which he had lately been an actor would have offered a sufficie=
nt answer. But in reality=20

the sharpened spur of wakefulness penetrated much more deeply. Beyond all d=
oubt or shadow of=20

doubt, it was the sinister, many-armed machine which had reached out to sei=
ze and destroy the=20

evidence against its allies and fellow conspirators, the lawbreaking railro=
ad company and the vote-

selling corporations.  And, again beyond doubt, he made sure, it was his ow=
n boast made to his=20

father which had been passed on to tell the sham burglar where to look and =
what to look for.=20

XVII  ON THE KNEES OF THE HIGH GODS   In the evening of the day following t=
he safe-blowing=20

in Blount's office, a one-car train, running as second section of the Overl=
and, slipped=20

unostentatiously into the capital railroad yard. With as little stir as it =
had made in its arrival, the=20

single-car train took a siding below the freight station, where it would be=
 concealed from the prying=20

eyes of any chance prowler from the newspaper offices.  Coincident with the=
 side-tracking O'Brien,=20

the vice-president's stenographer, dropped from the step of the car and wen=
t in search of a=20

telephone. When O'Brien was safely out of the way, a small man, clean-shave=
n and alert in his=20

movements, whipped out of the shadows of the nearest string of box-cars, pu=
shed brusquely past=20

the guarding porter, and presented himself at the desk in the roomy office =
compartment of the=20

private car.  The vice-president looked up and nodded. "How are you, Gibber=
t?" he said, and then:=20

"You may condense your report. I have seen the newspapers. In passing I may=
 say that it isn't=20

much to your credit that you had to fall back upon the methods of the yeggm=
en."  "There wasn't=20

any other way," protested the small man. "The papers were locked up in the =
cash-box of the safe,=20

and young Blount carried the only key."  "It was crude; not at all worthy o=
f a man of your ability,=20

Gibbert. And if the newspapers tell it straight, you came near being caught=
. How did that happen?"=20

"Blount went to a ball, and I shadowed him. His girl was there, and it look=
ed like a safe bet that=20

he'd stay to see the lights put out. But he didn't."  "Well, never mind; yo=
u got the papers, I=20

suppose?"  The company detective drew a thick envelope from his pocket and =
laid it upon the=20

desk. The vice-president tore it open and read rapidly through the file of =
letters it had enclosed,=20

tearing them one by one from the hold of the brass fastener at the upper le=
ft-hand corner as he=20

glanced them over. "The chuckle-headed fools!" he gritted, apostrophizing t=
he writers of the=20

letters. And then: "Gibbert, I'd like to go into this a little deeper, if w=
e had time; I'd like to know why=20

in hell every man in this State with whom we've had a private business arra=
ngement found it=20

necessary to spread the details out on paper and send them to young Blount!=
 Here; burn these=20

things as I hand them to you."  The small man struck a match and, using the=
 wide-mouthed metal=20

cuspidor for an ash-pan, lighted the letters one at a time as they were giv=
en to him. When the=20

cinder skeleton of the final sheet had been crushed into ashes, he rose fro=
m his knees and=20

reached for his hat.  "Any other orders?" he asked.  "No; nothing more. You=
 are reasonably sure=20

that you haven't been recognized here by any of our local people?"  "I've k=
ept the 'make-up' on=20

most of the time. I've been in Mr. Gantry's office a couple of times, and i=
n Mr. Kittredge's once,=20

and neither of them caught on to me."  "That's good. You'd better go now. O=
'Brien has gone after=20

Gantry and Kittredge, and I don't care to have them find you here. Better t=
ake the first train back to=20

Chicago. These mutton-headed police here might possibly get on your track, =
and we don't want to=20



have to explain anything to them."  Five minutes after the small man had dr=
opped from the step of=20

the "008," to disappear in the box-car shadows, Gantry and Kittredge came d=
own the yard and=20

entered the private car. Again the vice-president said, "How are you?" and =
nodded toward the=20

nearest chairs. "Sit down; I'll be through in a minute," and he went on rea=
ding the file of papers=20

taken up at the departure of the detective. At the end of the minute he sho=
t a question at the two=20

who were waiting.  "You got my message?"  Gantry answered for himself and t=
he superintendent.=20

"Yes. Your orders have been were put into the river; and though one of them=
 was sunk, the other=20

went through to the Persian Gulf.  "It was shown that this route was about =
a thousand miles less in=20

distance than any other to Kurrachee, the nearest port in India. But politi=
cal influences were at=20

work against it, first from Egypt, and then from some of the Powers, in the=
 belief that it would give=20

England an advantage in the affairs of Asia, and the scheme was dropped. No=
w we will take a=20

walk of half an hour about the ship; for school-children need rest and recr=
eation.  "But I wish to=20

remind you again that you are now near the ancient world; for Arabia is in =
sight all the time, and=20

Assyria, Babylonia, Syria are beyond it. The professor will have the floor =
after the intermission."=20

During the recess the party walked about the deck and observed the mountain=
s, which were still in=20

sight on both sides. Four bells, or ten o'clock, was the signal for them to=
 come together again.=20

Whatever might be anticipated farther south, the air was soft and pleasant,=
 and not over warm,=20

about 70 deg. in the shade.  "My excellent friend, Mr. Woolridge, has just =
reminded me of the=20

promise made by the commander that certain ancient travellers over the worl=
d should be taken up,=20

as we have frequent occasion to quote them," Professor Giroud began. "There=
 are only three of=20

them of any especial note, the first of whom is Herodotus, 'the Father of H=
istory,' as he is often=20

called, and was worthy of the title.  "He was born about 485 years before t=
he time of Christ, at=20

Helicarnassus, a Greek colony of Asia. This was about the time the Persians=
 were invading=20

Greece. When this city obtained its freedom, there was a dispute about the =
method of=20

government, in which he was involved, and which caused him to leave his nat=
ive place. For the=20

ancient time, over two thousand years ago, when they had no railroads and s=
teamboats, his=20

travels are remarkable for their extent. He went all over Asia Minor and Gr=
eece proper, as well as=20

the islands of the AEgean Sea. He visited Macedonia, Thrace, and the coasts=
 of the Black Sea.=20

"What was more remarkable, he penetrated to the Persian Empire and Babylon,=
 and toured Egypt=20

more thoroughly than most modern travellers. Then he extended his wandering=
s to Sicily and=20

lower Italy. He was alive at the first of the Peloponnesian War; but what b=
ecame of him, when or=20

where he died, is not known.  "He spent the greater part of his life in tra=
vel, though not for=20

pleasure, but in acquiring knowledge which he intended to make useful to th=
e world. He was the=20

most eminent geographer of his time, and he may father that science as appr=
opriately as that of=20

history. But he treated many other branches of knowledge, like the races of=
 men and their=20

peculiarities, mythology, archaeology, and, in fact, everything that came w=
ithin the range of his=20

observation. He was a man of a high order of intellect, a philosopher in hi=
s criticism of=20

governments. Modern scholars are greatly indebted to him, and his works are=
 still extant. He did=20

not have the highest style of composition; but he was an honest man, and he=
 wrote as he talked.=20

You can understand the frequent references to him in modern books of travel=
.  "Not as favorable a=20

notice can be given of Strabo, who was an ancient geographer. He was born a=
bout sixty-four=20

years before Christ, at Amasia in Pontus."  "Where was that?" asked the mag=
nate, who was taking=20



the deepest interest in the exercise.  "It is a name given to a country in =
the north-eastern corner of=20

Asia Minor, on the Black Sea, the ancient name of which was Pontus Euxinus,=
 or Euxine Sea,=20

from which it got its name. His mother was of Greek descent, and nothing is=
 known of his father. I=20

suppose you all know what strabismus means."  "I am sure I don't," replied =
Mrs. Blossom; and=20

probably she was the only one who could answer in the negative.  "In plain =
terms, it means cross-

eyed; and doubtless Strabo obtained his name from having this defect in his=
 eyes. Whether any of=20

his family were called so before him is not known. He studied with various =
learned men in Greece,=20

Rome, and Alexandria. It does not appear that he had any occupation, but de=
voted all his time to=20

study and travel. He wrote forty-seven books, and those on geography were v=
ery valuable; for he=20

wrote from his own observation, though sometimes he is very full, at others=
 very meagre. He is=20

regarded as by no means the equal of Herodotus.  "The third of whom I am to=
 speak is Diodorus=20

Siculus."  "You have put a tail on his name, Professor," added the magnate.=
  "That is as much a=20

part of his name as the rest of it, as used by scholars. It means that he w=
as born in Sicily. Very=20


_
few of our own men, knows that your car is here."  The vice-president took =
one of the long black=20

cigars from the open box on the flat-topped desk, and passed the box to his=
 two lieutenants.=20

"Light up," he said tersely. "I'm due in Twin Canyons City to-morrow mornin=
g, and we've got to=20

thresh this thing out in a hurry. Any change in the situation since your la=
st report?"  Gantry shook=20

his head. "Nothing very important. Blount's up-town office was broken into =
last night and his safe=20

ripped open with dynamite, as I suppose you have read in the papers. Who di=
d it, or why it was=20

done, nobody seems to know."  "Well, what came of it?"  "Nothing, so far as=
 I can find out,"=20

returned the traffic manager. "Blount had been to the Gordon dance, and he =
saw the light in his=20

office as he was coming down-town. When he went up to find out what was goi=
ng on, he caught=20

the safe-blower fairly in the act, but the fellow got away."  "Did Blount l=
ose anything?"  "That's the=20

queer part of it. Blount won't say much about it; and this morning he went =
around to police=20

headquarters and told the chief to drop the matter, giving as his reason th=
at he was too busy to=20

prosecute the fellow even if he was caught."  To a disinterested observer i=
t might have seemed a=20

little singular that the vice-president made no further comment upon the bu=
rglary. As a matter of=20

fact, his next question completely ignored it.  "What has Blount been doing=
 this week?" he asked.=20

"He has spoken twice; once at Arequipa and once at Hellersville. I understa=
nd he has=20

engagements enough to keep him out of town right up to election day."  "Tha=
t is good," was the=20

nodded approval. "He would only be in the way here at the capital." And the=
n pointedly to Gantry:=20

"Any more of that nonsense about putting a barrel of powder under us and bl=
owing us all up if we=20

don't build the freight tariffs over to suit his notion?"  "A good bit more=
 of it," Gantry admitted=20

reluctantly. "The other day he went so far as to set a time limit; gave me =
three days of grace in=20

which to file the public notice of the change in rates."  "What did you do?=
"  "I filed the notice--taking=20

care that the only copy should be the one I sent to Blount's office."  The =
vice-president looked=20

coldly at his division traffic manager.  "There are times, Gantry, when you=
 seem to be losing your=20

grip. Dave Blount's son isn't a school-boy, to be fooled by such a transpar=
ent trick as that! Don't=20

you suppose he knows, as well as you do, that the public notice has to be f=
iled in every station on=20

the road?"  "I had to take a chance--I've had to take a good many chances,"=
 protested the traffic=20

manager in his own defence; and Kittredge, a bearded giant who was fully th=
e vice-president's=20

match in heroic physique, removed his cigar to say: "That young fellow has =
been a frost. If he isn't=20

a wild-eyed fanatic, as Gantry insists he is, he is deeper than the deep bl=
ue sea! I'd just about as=20

soon have a box of dynamite kicking around underfoot as to have him messing=
 in this campaign=20

fight. I've been keeping cases on him, as you ordered, and he has worn out =
three of my best office=20

men on the job."  "You are prejudiced, Kittredge," was the vice-president's=
 comment. "It was the=20

best move in the entire campaign--putting him in the field. Apart from the =
public sentiment he has=20

been turning our way, we mustn't lose sight of the fact that we got hold of=
 him at a time when the=20

Honorable Senator was getting ready to turn us down."  "Speaking of the sen=
timent," Gantry put=20

in, "I don't know whether it's all sentiment or not. There's a sort of myst=
ery mixed up in this=20

speech-making business of Blount's. At first I thought maybe his sudden pop=
ularity was due to=20

some word sent out from your Chicago office; but when you told me it wasn't=
, I began to do a little=20

speculating on my own account. I can't make up my mind yet whether it is pu=
re popularity, or=20

whether it's the assisted kind."  "Assisted?" said the vice-president, with=
 a lifting of the heavy=20

eyebrows.  "Yes. It has been too unanimous. I have a trustworthy man in Blo=
unt's up-town office,=20



and he says the invitations have fluttered in like autumn leaves; more than=
 Blount could accept if=20

he travelled continuously. Kittredge's men report that the speech-making ha=
s been a triumphant=20

progress all over the State; bands, receptions, committees, and banquets wh=
erever Blount goes."=20

Mr. McVickar grunted. "The speeches have been all that anybody could ask. I=
've been reading=20

them."  Kittredge shook his head.  "Gantry says they are, but I say no," he=
 contended. "There is=20

such a thing as putting too much sugar in the coffee. Blount's overdoing it=
; he's about him beyond=20

what he told himself. He lived in the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus, a=
nd for a long time in=20

Rome. He travelled in Europe and Asia for material. He wrote a history of t=
he world from the=20

creation to the time of Julius Caesar. Some of the volumes are lost, and so=
me of them are still=20

read.  "Diodorus was deficient in the qualifications of a historian; and ab=
out all that is valuable in=20

his writings is the mass of facts he gives, from which he was not competent=
 to make the proper=20

deductions. The material he gathered is valuable; but the thirty years he s=
pent in the composition=20

of his works have not purchased for him the literary reputation of Herodotu=
s, or even of Strabo."  "I=20

am very much obliged to you for your lecture, and I hope others besides mys=
elf have profited by=20

it," said Mr. Woolridge.  The professor bowed, and took some manuscript fro=
m his pocket.=20

CHAPTER XXVIII  THE ANCIENT KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD   When the promenade had=
=20

been transformed into Conference Hall, the arrangement for the maps had not=
 been forgotten, and=20

the frame had been set up against the after end of the pilot-house. It cove=
red the two windows; but=20

they were not needed when the ship was at sea. When the professor made his =
bow, Mr. Gaskette=20

exposed to the view of the audience a map which had been completed before t=
he steamer arrived=20

at Port Said; and all the way through the canal he and his assistants had b=
een busy upon others.=20

"Perhaps I ought to apologize for this map, Captain Ringgold," said Mr. Gas=
kette, when he had=20

unrolled the huge sheet; "for the boundaries of these ancient countries are=
 so indefinite in the=20

great atlas that I have not been able to lay down all of them."  "You have =
done exceedingly well,=20

Mr. Gaskette, and I think the professor can ask for nothing better than you=
 have given him,"=20

replied the commander.  "Certainly not," added the learned gentleman. "I ca=
n give the boundaries=20

no more definitely than they are presented on this beautiful map. I am extr=
emely delighted to have=20

the assistance which it will afford me. The artist might have guessed at so=
me of the division lines,=20

as others have done. He has given us Mesopotamia, Susiana, and the region b=
etween them, and=20

that is all I desire.  "Perhaps I shall disappoint you, Mr. Commander, by t=
he meagreness of my=20

description of these ancient countries; for these subjects in detail would =
be very tiresome to the=20

company under present circumstances, and I propose to bring out only a few =
salient points in=20

regard to them," said the professor.  "The only thing I feared, Professor, =
was that you would go=20

into them too diffusely, forgetting that your audience are not savants, or =
even college students,=20

such as you have been in the habit of addressing. I am very glad to find th=
at you have just the right=20

idea in regard to the situation," replied Captain Ringgold.  "It is fortuna=
te that we agree," continued=20

the instructor, as he took the pointer and turned to the map. "This map lay=
s before you the region=20

lying to the north-east of Arabia, on the port hand of the ship, as the com=
mander would say; and=20

with your imagination you can look over these mountains and sands and see i=
t. You observe that=20

Syria is on the west of the northern part of it, with Armenia just where it=
 is now, on the north of it,=20

though there was more of it then than now; for in ancient times it reached =
to the Caspian Sea. An=20

old lady in the country at whose house I used to spend my vacation used to =
call things that could=20



not be changed as fixed as the laws of the 'Medes and Parsicans.' She meant=
 the Medes and=20

Persians; and Media, now a part of Persia, was the eastern boundary of the =
region mapped out=20

On the south-east is Susiana, now a large portion of Persia.  "This beautif=
ul map tempts me to be=20

more diffuse than I should have been without it; but it gives you a bit of =
ancient geography which=20

will do you no harm. There are two great rivers which extend through this t=
erritory, the Euphrates=20

and the Tigris, though both of them unite and flow into the Persian Gulf. O=
f the former of them the=20

commander has spoken to you this morning. Scholars have not been able to lo=
cate Paradise, or=20

the Garden of Eden, with anything like precision; but it is generally suppo=
sed to have been=20

between these two great streams. Some think it was not a place at all, but =
only a location given to=20

a moral idea; others place it in the mountains of Armenia or Northern Mesop=
otamia."  "The pesky=20

Bible critics!" exclaimed Mrs. Blossom; but Mrs. Belgrave "hunched her" as =
the good lady=20

expressed it.  "All this region has been in the possession of various maste=
rs, and even the=20


_
that happens to be thrown will stick and look bad."  "Of course, we have to=
 take chances on that,"=20

was the vice-president's qualifying clause. "Nevertheless, young Blount's t=
alk has undoubtedly had=20

its effect upon public sentiment. We must be careful not to let the opposit=
ion newspapers get hold=20

of anything that would tend to nullify it."  "They are moving heaven and ea=
rth to do it," said the=20

superintendent. "The Honorable David is lying low, as he usually does, but =
I more than half believe=20

he's getting ready to give us the double-cross. That is the explanation of =
this safe-blowing scrape,=20

as I put it up."  Again the vice-president failed to comment further on the=
 burglary. "What I am most=20

afraid of, now, is that our young man may be, as you say, Kittredge, a trif=
le over-zealous," he said=20

musingly. "We have portion of the northern part," continued the professor, =
indicating the location=20

with his wand. "In the British Museum and elsewhere you have seen bass-reli=
efs and figures=20

brought from the ruins of Assyrian cities, and in these the country is call=
ed Assur. In Genesis x. 11,=20

we read: 'Out of that land [Shinar] went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh.=
' This was said of=20

Nimrod; Shinar was a name of Babylonia.  "The history becomes complicated, =
and is a record of=20

the achievements of the Assyrian kings, Tiglath-Pileser, Sargon, Sennacheri=
b, and others. It would=20

not be profitable to go over them. The Babylonian monarchy was before Assyr=
ia was founded. The=20

government was a despotism with nothing to soften it, and the religion was =
the worship of many=20

gods. Its history dates back from 913 to 659 years before the birth of=20


_
"He's more than that," Kittredge cut in quickly. "One of the men I've had f=
ollowing him--Farnsworth-

-is as good as any Pinkerton that ever walked. He says Blount isn't half so=
 innocent as he looks=20

and acts. The speech-making has taken him into every corner of the State, a=
nd Farnsworth says=20

he has been doing a lot of quiet prying there are tablets which carry it ba=
ck to 2330 A.D. The=20

empire began to decay in the reign of Sardanapalus, when the governor of Ba=
bylon and the king=20

of Media conspired against it; and Nineveh was captured and destroyed a lit=
tle more than 600=20

years before Christ."  The commander announced another recess at this time,=
 though the party=20


_
investigating on the side."  "I've been thinking," Gantry added, "what a be=
autiful mix-up we should=20

have if the senator and his son should both conclude to pull out and get to=
