He was, as I have said, a jovial man, and a kind-hearted fellow, in his way=
. Rumour spread the=20

story of his dashing adventures far and wide--exaggerating and intensifying=
 their commonplace=20

into wild romance. This alone fascinated the public mind. But again, rumour=
 having taken Tommy=20

Johnson under her protection, just as she wantonly injures so many others, =
she made the very=20

most she could of his merits. Every single act of kindness he had ever perf=
ormed was magnified a=20

hundredfold, and the common smuggler became a hero. I verily believe that T=
ommy Johnson=20

could have got a hundred acquittals, at as many consecutive assizes. I don'=
t believe that a jury=20

could be found to pronounce that awful word guilty to an indictment preferr=
ed by the Crown=20

against him.  Tommy Johnson, after his acquittal, returned home, in a condi=
tion which an original=20

mind has described as that of a wiser, sadder, and poorer man than he was p=
rior to the last run.=20

He, however, laudably determined not to make another adventure. He would no=
t seek, through=20

new perils, to retrieve his loss. Without any claims to the character of po=
et himself, he drew=20

philosophy from Hamlet, and resolved to bear the ills he had rather than fl=
y to others which, his=20

lawyers told him, he could not fathom the depths of. He would stick to the =
safe pursuit of fortune=20

on land, and not tempt the perils of the deep in the way he had done. In on=
e of his soliloquies on=20

this point he observed that he had made money at it, but he was afraid that=
 he had used up his=20

luck. He of men, the Dutch  [Illustration: THE RELIEF OF LEYDEN.]  were str=
uggling to throw off=20

the yoke of Spain. Leyden was besieged. The town was well fortified. The Sp=
aniards endeavored=20

to starve the city into surrender. They swarmed about the outworks and taun=

uld in the least aid to=20

sustain life. But =E2=80=9Cso long as a dog barked in the city, the Spaniar=

few faint-hearted ones pleaded with the burgomaster to yield. But the brave=
 Van der Werff, gaunt,=20

pale, wearied with care and watching, told them they could only surrender w=
hen they had eaten=20

him; so long as he lived, the city should not yield.  It was a terrible tim=

wished to help their friends within--but the lines of the enemy were too st=

the =E2=80=9CSilent Man=E2=80=9D ordered the dykes cut. It was done. The co=
