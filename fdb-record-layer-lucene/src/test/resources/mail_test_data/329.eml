XV  Frightened Indians   "There must be some mistake," said Tom, wondering =
if the Irish foreman=20

were given to joking. Yet he did not seem that kind of man.  "Mistake? How =
can there be a=20

mistake, sor? I wint in there to tell th' black imps t' come out, but they'=
re not there to tell!"  "What's=20

the trouble?" asked Job Titus, coming out of the office near the tunnel mou=
th. "What's wrong,=20

Tom?"  "Why, I sent Tim in to tell the men to come out, as I was going to s=

says the men aren't in there. And I'm sure the last shift hasn't come out."=
  By this time Koku, Mr.=20

Damon and Walter Titus had marched forth from Fort York with drums beating,=
 flag flying, and with=20

arms and baggage.  They hardly knew whither they were to go, or what fate a=
waited them.  A vast,=20

and inhospitable region surrounded {153} them, and a winter long to be reme=
mbered for its=20

severity had begun.  But to the French it seemed as if their spirits were u=
ndaunted, and they set=20

forth bravely.  The enemy watched the retreat of the defeated garrison not =
without admiration, and=20

for the moment speculation was rife as to their fate. But it was only for a=
 moment.  Too rejoiced to=20

contemplate anything but the termination of their own sufferings, the Canad=
ians hastened to enter=20

the fort, headed by Boisbriant, late an ensign in the service of the Compag=
nie du Nord.  Fort=20

Nelson was once more in the hands of the French.   On the St. Lawrence the =
Count of Frontenac,=20

old as he was, sickening of the perpetual raids, led a great war force=20

what the trouble was.  "The min have disappeared--that's all there is to it=
!" Tim said.  "Perhaps=20

they have missed their way--the lights may have gone out, and they might ha=
ve wandered into=20

some abandoned cutting," suggested Tom.  "There aren't any abandoned cuttin=
's," declared Tim.=20

"It's a straight bore, not a shaft of any kind. I've looked everywhere, and=
 th' min aren't there I tell=20

ye!"  "Are the lights going?" asked Job. "You might have missed them in the=
 dark, Tim."  "The=20

lights are going all right, Mr. Titus," said the the Iroquois.  Rebuilding =
Fort Frontenac, which had=20

been destroyed, he launched his men straight against the Onondaga lodges, w=
iping out all their=20

stores of food and their maize harvests.  He laid low also the land of the =
Oneidas, and the warriors=20

of both tribes fled before him.  If they could raid and butcher, by St. Lou=
is, so could he!  The=20

Iroquois looked to the English for help against the French.  Whatever they =

"All right," and the young inventor disconnected the electrical detonating =
switch. "I'll come along=20

and have a look too," he added. "Don't let anybody meddle with the wires, J=
ack," he said to the=20

young Englishman who was in charge of the dynamo.  of England and France.  =
Tired of the=20

conflict grew the haughty Five Nations, and deputies were sent to Quebec to=
 bring it to an end.=20

They offered, as before, to cease fighting the French Canadians, but not th=
eir Indian allies in the=20

west.  {154} This would not satisfy Frontenac: he would make no peace which=
 could not be lasting.=20

The Governor of New York interfered.  "The Iroquois," he told Frontenac, "a=

Job Titus. "If some of the other Indians hear you go on this way they'll de=
sert as they did once=20

before."  "Did they account.  I have told them to be at peace with you.  He=
nceforward you must not=20

treat them as enemies."  "I will make my peace with the Five Nations," Fron=
tenac thundered forth=20

to the Indian deputy, "but it shall be on my own terms.  If we continue to =
