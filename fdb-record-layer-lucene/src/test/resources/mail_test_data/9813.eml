cause may be found in the destruction and total loss of all the     written=
 memorials of the secret=20

knowledge of the remotest     antiquity.      Numa's books, described by Li=
vy, consisting of natural=20

philosophy,     were found in his tomb; but they were not allowed to be mad=
e     known, lest they=20

should reveal the most secret mysteries of the     state religion.... The s=
enate and the tribunes of=20

the people     determined ... that the books themselves should be burned, w=
hich     was done.(548)=20

Cassain mentions a treatise, well-known in the fourth and fifth centuries, =
which was accredited to=20

Ham, the son of Noah, who in his turn was reputed to have received it from =
Jared, the fourth=20

generation from Seth, the son of Adam.  Alchemy also was first taught in Eg=
ypt by her learned=20

Priests, though the first appearance of this system is as old as man. Many =
writers have declared=20

that Adam was the first Adept; but that was a blind and a pun upon the name=
, which is "red earth"=20

in one of its meanings. The correct information--under its allegorical veil=
--is found in the sixth=20

chapter of Genesis, which speaks of the "Sons of God" who took wives of the=
 daughters of men,=20

after which they communicated to these wives many a mystery and secret of t=
he phenomenal=20

world. The cradle of Alchemy, says Olaus Borrichius, is to be sought in the=
 most distant times.=20

Democritus of Abdera was an Alchemist, and a Hermetic Philosopher. Clement =
of Alexandria=20

wrote considerably upon the Science, and Moses and Solomon are called profi=
cients in it. We are=20

told by W. Godwin:       The first authentic record on this subject is an e=
dict of     Diocletian about=20

300 years A.D., ordering a diligent search to be     made in Egypt for all =
the ancient books which=20

treated of the art     of making gold and silver, that they might, without =
distinction,     be consigned=20

to the flames.   The Alchemy of the Chaldaeans and the old Chinamen is not =
even the parent of=20

that Alchemy which revived among the Arabians many centuries later. There i=
s a spiritual Alchemy=20

and a physical transmutation. The knowledge of both was imparted at the Ini=
tiations.      SECTION=20

XXXIV. THE POST-CHRISTIAN SUCCESSORS TO THE MYSTERIES.   The Eleusinian=20

Mysteries were no more. Yet it was these which gave their principal feature=
s to the Neo-platonic=20

school of Ammonius Saccas, for the Eclectic System was chiefly characterise=
d by its Theurgy and=20

ecstasis. It was Iamblichus who added to it the Egyptian doctrine of Theurg=
y with its practices, and=20

Porphyry, the Jew, who opposed this new element. The school, however, with =
but few exceptions,=20

practised asceticism and contemplation, its mystics passing through a disci=
pline as rigorous as=20

that of the Hindu devotee. Their efforts never tended so much to develop th=
e successful practice=20

of thaumaturgy, necromancy or sorcery--such as they are now accused of--as =
to evolve the higher=20

faculties of the inner man, the Spiritual Ego. The school held that a numbe=
r of spiritual beings,=20

denizens of spheres quite independent of the earth and of the human cycle, =
were mediators=20

between the "Gods" and men, and even between man and the Supreme Soul. To p=
ut it in plainer=20

language, the soul of man became, owing to the help of the Planetary Spirit=
s, "recipient of the soul=20

of the world" as Emerson puts it. Apollonius of Tyana asserted his possessi=
on of such a power in=20

these words (quoted by Professor Wilder in his _Neo-Platonism_):       I ca=
n see the present and=20

the future in a clear mirror. The sage     [Adept] need not wait for the va=
pours of the earth and the=20

corruption of the air to foresee plagues and fevers; he must know     them =
later than God, but=20

earlier than the people. The _theoi_ or     gods see the future; common men=
, the present; sages,=20

that which is     about to take place. My peculiar abstemious mode of livin=
g     produces such an=20

acuteness of the senses, or creates some other     faculty, so that the gre=
atest and most=20

remarkable things may be     performed.(549)   Professor A. Wilder's commen=
t thereupon is=20



remarkable:       This is what may be termed _spiritual photography_. The s=
oul is     the camera in=20

which facts and events, future, past, and present,     are alike fixed; and=
 the mind becomes=20

conscious of them. Beyond     our everyday world of limits, all is as one d=
ay or state--the past=20

and future comprised in the present. Probably this is the "great     day," =
the "_last_ day," the "day=20

of the Lord," of the Bible     writers--the day into which everyone passes =
by death or _ecstasis_.=20

Then the soul is freed from the constraint of the body, and its     nobler =
part is united to higher=20

nature and becomes partaker in the     wisdom and foreknowledge of the high=
er beings.(550)=20

How far the system practised by the Neo-Platonists was identical with that =
of the old and the=20

modern Vedantins may be inferred from what Dr. A. Wilder says of the Alexan=
drian Theosophists.=20

The anterior idea of the New Platonists was that of a single     Supreme Es=
sence.... All the old=20

philosophies contained the     doctrine that {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~=
GREEK SMALL=20

LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA=20

WITH VARIA~}, _theoi_, gods or disposers, angels, demons,     and other spi=
ritual agencies,=20

emanated from the Supreme Being.     Ammonius accepted the doctrine of the =
Books of Hermes,=20

that from     the divine All proceeded the Divine Wisdom or Amun; that from=
     Wisdom proceeded=20

the Demiurge or Creator; and from, the Creator,     the subordinate spiritu=
al beings; the world and=20

its peoples being     the last. The first is contained in the second, the f=
irst and     second in the=20

third, and so on through the entire series.(551)   This is a perfect echo o=
f the belief of the=20

Vedantins, and it proceeds directly from the secret teachings of the East. =
The same author says:=20

Akin to this is the doctrine of the Jewish Kabala which was taught     by t=
he Pharsi or Pharisees,=20

who probably borrowed it, as their     sectarian designation would seem to =
indicate, from the=20

Magians of     Persia. It is substantially embodied in the following synops=
is.      The Divine Being is=20

the All, the source of all existence, the     Infinite; and He cannot be kn=
own. The Universe reveals=20

Him, and     subsists by Him. At the beginning His effulgence went forth   =
  everywhere.(552)=20

Eventually He retired within Himself and so     formed around Him a vacant =
space. Into this He=20

transmitted His     first Emanation, a Ray, containing in it the generative=
 and     conceptive power,=20

and hence the name IE, or Jah. This in its turn     produced the _tikkun_, =
the _pattern_ or idea of=20

form; and in this     emanation, which also contained the male and female, =
or generative     and=20

conceptive potencies, were the three primitive forces of     Light, Spirit =
and Life. This Tikkun is=20

united to the Ray, or first     emanation, and pervaded by it: and by that =
union is also in=20

perpetual communication with the infinite source. It is the     pattern, th=
e primitive man, the Adam=20

Kadmon, the _macrocosm_ of     Pythagoras and other philosophers. From it p=
roceeded the=20

_Sephiroth_.... From the Sephiroth in turn emanated the four     worlds, ea=
ch proceeding out of the=20

one immediately above it, and     the lower one enveloping its superior. Th=
ese worlds became less=20

pure as they descended in the scale, the lowest of all being the     materi=
al world.(553)   This=20

veiled enunciation of the Secret Teaching will be clear to our readers by t=
his time. These worlds=20

are:       _Aziluth_ is peopled with the purest emanations [the First, almo=
st     spiritual, Race of the=20

human beings that were to inhabit] the     Fourth; the second, _Beriah_, by=
 a lower order, the=20

servants of     the former [the second Race]; the third, _Jesirah_, by the =
    cherubim and=20

seraphim, the Elohim and B'ni Elohim ["Sons of Gods"     or _Elohim_, our T=
hird Race]. The fourth=20

world, _Asiah_, is     inhabited by the Klipputh, of whom Belial is chief [=
the Atlantean=20

Sorcerers].(554)   These worlds are all the earthly duplicates of their hea=
venly prototypes, the=20



mortal and temporary reflections and shadows of the more durable, if not et=
ernal, races dwelling in=20

other, to us, invisible worlds. The souls of the men of our Fifth Race deri=
ve their elements from=20

these four worlds--Root Races--that preceded ours: namely, our intellect, M=
anas, the fifth=20

principle, our passions and mental and corporeal appetites. A conflict havi=
ng arisen, called "war in=20

heaven," among our prototypical worlds, war came to pass, aeons later, betw=
een the=20

Atlanteans(555) of Asiah, and those of the third Root Race, the B'ni Elohim=
 or the "Sons of=20

God,"(556) and then evil and wickedness were intensified. Mankind (in the l=
ast sub-race of the=20

third Root Race) having       Sinned in their first parent [a physiological=
 allegory, truly!]     from=20

whose soul every human soul is an emanation,   says the _Zohar_, men were "=
exiled" into more=20

material bodies to       Expiate that sin and become proficient in goodness=
.   To accomplish the=20

cycle of necessity, rather, explains the doctrine; to progress on their tas=
k of evolution, from which=20

task none of us can be freed, neither by death nor suicide, for each of us =
have to pass through the=20

"Valley of Thorns" before he emerges into the plains of divine light and re=
st. And thus men will=20

continue to be born in new bodies       Till they have become sufficiently =
pure to enter a higher=20

form of     existence.   This means only that Mankind, from the First down =
to the last, or Seventh=20

Race, is composed of one and the same company of actors, who have descended=
 from higher=20

spheres to perform their artistic tour on this our planet, Earth. Starting =
as pure spirits on our=20

downward journey around the world (verily!) with the knowledge of truth--no=
w feebly echoed in the=20

Occult Doctrines--inherent in us, cyclic law brings us down to the reversed=
 apex of matter, which is=20

lost down here on earth and the bottom of which we have already struck; and=
 then, the same law=20

of spiritual gravity will make us slowly ascend to still higher, still pure=
r spheres than those we=20

started from.  Foresight, prophecy, oracular powers! Illusive fancies of ma=
n's dwarfed perceptions,=20

which see actual images in reflections and shadows, and mistake past actual=
ities for prophetic=20

images of a future that has no room in Eternity. Our macrocosm and its smal=
lest microcosm, man,=20

are both repeating the same play of universal and individual events at each=
 station, as on every=20

stage on which Karma leads them to enact their respective dramas of life. F=
alse prophets could=20

have no existence had there been no true prophets. And so there were, and m=
any of both classes,=20

and in all ages. Only, none of these ever saw anything but that which had a=
lready come to pass,=20

and had been before prototypically enacted in higher spheres--if the event =
foretold related to=20

national or public weal or woe--or in some preceding life, if it concerned =
only an individual, for=20

every such event is stamped as an indelible record of the Past and Future, =
which are only, after=20

all, the ever Present in Eternity. The "worlds" and the purifications spoke=
n of in the _Zohar_ and=20

other Kabalistic books, relate to our globe and races no more and no less t=
han they relate to other=20

globes and other races that have preceded our own in the great cycle. It wa=
s such fundamental=20

truths as these that were performed in allegorical plays and images during =
the Mysteries, the last=20

Act of which, the Epilogue for the Mystae, was the _anastasis_ or "continue=
d existence," as also=20

the "Soul transformation."  Hence, the author of _Neo-platonism and Alchemy=
_ shows us that all=20

such Eclectic doctrines were strongly reflected in the _Epistles_ of Paul, =
and were       Inculcated=20

more or less among the Churches. Hence, such passages     as these "Ye were=
 dead in errors=20

and sins; ye walked according to     the _aeon_ of this world, according to=
 the _archon_ that has=20

the     domination of the air." "We wrestle not against flesh and blood,   =
  but against the=20

dominations, against potencies, against the lords     of darkness, and agai=
nst the mischievousness=20



of spirits in the     empyrean regions." But Paul was evidently hostile to =
the effort to     blend his=20

gospel with the gnostic ideas of the Hebrew-Egyptian     school, as seems t=
o have been attempted=20

at Ephesus; and     accordingly, wrote to Timothy, his favourite disciple, =
"Keep safe     the precious=20

charge entrusted to thee; and reject the new     doctrines and the antagoni=
stic principles of the=20

gnosis, falsely     so-called, of which some have made profession and gone =
astray from     the=20

faith."(557)   But as the Gnosis is the Science pertaining to our Higher Se=
lf, as blind faith is a=20

matter of temperament and emotionalism, and as Paul's doctrine was still ne=
wer and his=20

interpretations far more thickly veiled, to keep the inner truths hidden fa=
r away from the Gnostic,=20

preference has been given to the former by every earnest seeker after truth=
.  Besides this, the=20

great Teachers who professed the so-called "false Gnosis" were very numerou=
s in the days of the=20

Apostles, and were as great as any converted Rabbi could be. If Porphyry, t=
he Jew Malek, went=20

against Theurgy on account of old traditional recollections, there were oth=
er teachers who=20

practised it. Plotinus, Iamblichus, Proclus were all thaumaturgists, and th=
e latter       Elaborated the=20

entire theosophy and theurgy of his predecessors     into a complete system=
. (558)   As to=20

Ammonius,       Countenanced by Clemens and Athenagoras, in the Church, and=
 by     learned=20

men of the Synagogue, the Academy, and the Grove, he     fulfilled his labo=
ur by teaching a=20

common doctrine for all.(559)   Thus it is not Judaism and Christianity tha=
t re-modelled the ancient=20

Pagan Wisdom, but rather the latter that put its heathen curb, quietly and =
insensibly, on the new=20

faith; and this, moreover, was still further influenced by the Eclectic The=
osophical system, the=20

direct emanation of the Wisdom Religion. All that is grand and noble in Chr=
istian theology comes=20

from Neo-Platonism. It is too well-known to now need much repetition that A=
mmonius Saccas, the=20

God-taught (_theodidaktos_) and the lover of the truth (_philalethes_), in =
establishing his school,=20

made a direct attempt to benefit the world by teaching those portions of th=
e Secret Science that=20

were permitted by its direct guardians to be revealed in those days.(560) T=
he modern movement=20

of our own Theosophical Society was begun on the same principles; for the N=
eo-Platonic school of=20

Ammonius aimed, as we do, at the reconcilement of all sects and peoples, un=
der the once=20

common faith of the Golden Age, trying to induce the nations to lay aside t=
heir contentions--in=20

religious matters at any rate--by proving to them that their various belief=
s are all the more or less=20

legitimate children of one common parent, the Wisdom Religion.  Nor was the=
 Eclectic=20

Theosophical system--as some writers inspired by Rome would make the world =
believe--

developed only during the third century of our era; but it belongs to a muc=
h earlier age, as has=20

been shown by Diogenes Laertius. He traces it to the beginning of the dynas=
ty of the Ptolemies; to=20

the great seer and prophet, the Egyptian Priest Pot-Amun, of the temple of =
the God of that name--

for Amun is the God of Wisdom. Unto that day the communication between the =
Adepts of Upper=20

India and Bactria and the Philosophers of the West had never ceased.       =
Under Philadelphus ...=20

the Hellenic teachers became rivals of the     College of Rabbis of Babylon=
. The Buddhistic,=20

Vedantic and Magian     systems were expounded along with the philosophies =
of Greece....=20

Aristobulus, the Jew, declared that the ethics of Aristotle were     derive=
d from the law were only a=20

blind, increased, and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and=
 resolved to trust entirely=20

to his guidance.     19. Pates made by the Successor of Father Marteau are =
described.   In half an=20

hour La Ramee returned, full of glee, like most men who have eaten, and mor=
e especially drank to=20

their heart's content. The pates were excellent, the wine delicious.  The w=
eather was fine and the=20



game at tennis took place in the open air.  At two o'clock the tennis balls=
 began, according to=20

Grimaud's directions, to take the direction of the moat, much to the joy of=
 La Ramee, who marked=20

fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat; and very soon balls we=
re wanting, so many=20

had gone over. La Ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up, but=
 the duke=20

remarked that it would be losing time; and going near the rampart himself a=
nd looking over, he=20

saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the =
peasants on the=20

opposite side of the moat.  "Hey, friend!" cried the duke.  The man raised =
his head and the duke=20

was about to utter a cry of surprise. The peasant, the gardener, was Rochef=
ort, whom he believed=20

to be in the Bastile.  "Well? Who's up there?" said the man.  "Be so good a=
s to collect and throw=20

us back our balls," said the duke.  The gardener nodded and began to fling =
up the balls, which=20

were picked up by La Ramee and the guard. One, however, fell at the duke's =
feet, and seeing that=20

it was intended for him, he put it into his pocket.  La Ramee was in ecstas=
ies at having beaten a=20

prince of the blood.  The duke went indoors and retired to bed, where he sp=
ent, indeed, the=20

greater part of every day, as they had taken his books away. La Ramee carri=
ed off all his clothes,=20

in order to be certain that the duke would not stir. However, the duke cont=
rived to hide the ball=20

under his bolster and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover =
of the ball with his teeth=20

and found underneath the following letter:  My Lord,--Your friends are watc=
hing over you and the=20

hour of your deliverance is at hand. Ask day after to-morrow to have a pie =
supplied you by the new=20

confectioner opposite the castle, and who is no other than Noirmont, your f=
ormer maitre d'hotel.=20

Do not open the pie till you are alone. I hope you will be satisfied with i=
ts contents.  "Your=20

highness's most devoted servant,  "In the Bastile, as elsewhere,  "Comte de=
 Rochefort."  The=20

duke, who had latterly been allowed a fire, burned the letter, but kept the=
 ball, and went to bed,=20

hiding the ball under his bolster. La Ramee entered; he smiled kindly on th=
e prisoner, for he was=20

an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince. He en=
deavored to cheer him=20

up in his solitude.  "Ah, my friend!" cried the duke, "you are so good; if =
I could but do as you do,=20

and eat pates and drink Burgundy at the house of Father Marteau's successor=
."  "'Tis true, my=20

lord," answered La Ramee, "that his pates are famous and his wine magnifice=
nt."  "In any case,"=20

said the duke, "his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of Monsieur=
 de Chavigny."  "Well,=20

my lord," said La Ramee, falling into the trap, "what is there to prevent y=
our trying them? Besides,=20

I have promised him your patronage."  "You are right," said the duke. "If I=
 am to remain here=20

permanently, as Monsieur Mazarin has kindly given me to understand, I must =
provide myself with=20

a diversion for my old age, I must turn gourmand."  "My lord," said La Rame=
e, "if you will take a bit=20

of good advice, don't put that off till you are old."  "Good!" said the Duc=
 de Beaufort to himself,=20

"every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul, must receive from =
celestial bounty one of=20

the seven capital sins, perhaps two; it seems that Master La Ramee's is glu=
ttony. Let us then take=20

advantage of it." Then, aloud:  "Well, my dear La Ramee! the day after to-m=
orrow is a holiday."=20

"Yes, my lord--Pentecost."  "Will you give me a lesson the day after to-mor=
row?"  "In what?"  "In=20

gastronomy?"  "Willingly, my lord."  "But tete-a-tete. Send the guards to t=
ake their meal in the=20

canteen of Monsieur de Chavigny; we'll have a supper here under your direct=
ion."  "Hum!" said La=20

Ramee.  The proposal was seductive, but La Ramee was an old stager, acquain=
ted with all the=20

traps a prisoner was likely to set. Monsieur de Beaufort had said that he h=
ad forty ways of getting=20

out of prison. Did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem? He reflect=
ed, but he=20



remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and t=
herefore that no=20

powder could be mixed with the food, no drug with the wine. As to getting h=
im drunk, the duke=20

couldn't hope to do that, and he laughed at the mere thought of it. Then an=
 idea came to him=20

which harmonized everything.  The duke had followed with anxiety La Ramee's=
 unspoken=20

soliloquy, reading it from point to point upon his face. But presently the =
exempt's face suddenly=20

brightened.  "Well," he asked, "that will do, will it not?"  "Yes, my lord,=
 on one condition."  "What?"=20

"That Grimaud shall wait on us at table."  Nothing could be more agreeable =
to the duke, however,=20

he had presence of mind enough to exclaim:  "To the devil with your Grimaud=
! He will spoil the=20

feast."  "I will direct him to stand behind your chair, and since he doesn'=
t speak, your highness will=20

neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred=
 miles away."  "Do you=20

know, my friend, I find one thing very evident in all this, you distrust me=
."  "My lord, the day after=20

to-morrow is Pentecost."  "Well, what is Pentecost to me? Are you afraid th=
at the Holy Spirit will=20

come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison?"  "No, my lord; bu=
t I have already told=20

you what that damned magician predicted."  "And what was it?"  "That the da=
y of Pentecost would=20

not pass without your highness being out of Vincennes."  "You believe in so=
rcerers, then, you=20

fool?"  "I---I mind them no more than that----" and he snapped his fingers;=
 "but it is my Lord Giulio=20

who cares about them; as an Italian he is superstitious."  The duke shrugge=
d his shoulders.  "Well,=20

then," with well acted good-humor, "I allow Grimaud, but no one else; you m=
ust manage it all.=20

Order whatever you like for supper--the only thing I specify is one of thos=
e pies; and tell the=20

confectioner that I will promise him my custom if he excels this time in hi=
s pies--not only now, but=20

when I leave my prison."  "Then you think you will some day leave it?" said=
 La Ramee.  "The=20

devil!" replied the prince; "surely, at the death of Mazarin. I am fifteen =
years younger than he is. At=20

Vincennes, 'tis true, one lives faster----"  "My lord," replied La Ramee, "=
my lord----"  "Or dies=20

sooner, for it comes to the same thing."  La Ramee was going out. He stoppe=
d, however, at the=20

door for an instant.  "Whom does your highness wish me to send to you?"  "A=
ny one, except=20

Grimaud."  "The officer of the guard, then, with his chessboard?"  "Yes."  =
Five minutes afterward=20

the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combi=
nations of chess.  A=20

strange thing is the mind, and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrou=
ght in it by a sign, a=20

word, a hope. The duke had been five years in prison, and now to him, looki=
ng back upon them,=20

those five years, which had passed so slowly, seemed not so long a time as =
were the two days,=20

the forty-eight hours, which still parted him from the time fixed for his e=
scape. Besides, there was=20

one thing that engaged his most anxious thought--in what way was the escape=
 to be effected?=20

They had told him to hope for it, but had not told him what was to be hidde=
n in the mysterious=20

pate. And what friends awaited him without? He had friends, then, after fiv=
e years in prison? If that=20

were so he was indeed a highly favored prince. He forgot that besides his f=
riends of his own sex, a=20

woman, strange to say, had remembered him. It is true that she had not, per=
haps, been=20

scrupulously faithful to him, but she had remembered him; that was somethin=
g.  So the duke had=20

more than enough to think about; accordingly he fared at chess as he had fa=
red at tennis; he=20

made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him eas=
y game.  But his=20

successive defeats did service to the duke in one way--they killed time for=
 him till eight o'clock in=20

the evening; then would come night, and with night, sleep. So, at least, th=
e duke believed; but=20

sleep is a capricious fairy, and it is precisely when one invokes her prese=
nce that she is most likely=20



to keep him waiting. The duke waited until midnight, turning on his mattres=
s like St. Laurence on=20

his gridiron. Finally he slept.  But at daybreak he awoke. Wild dreams had =
disturbed his repose.=20

He dreamed that he was endowed with wings--he wished to fly away. For a tim=
e these wings=20

supported him, but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him=
. His wings were=20

broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss, whence he awoke, bath=
ed in perspiration=20

and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen. He fell asleep agai=
n and another vision=20

appeared. He was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave Vincenn=
es. Grimaud was=20

walking before him with a lantern. By degrees the passage narrowed, yet the=
 duke continued his=20

course. At last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proc=
eed. The sides of the walls=20

seem to close in, even to press against him. He made fruitless efforts to g=
o on; it was impossible.=20

Nevertheless, he still saw Grimaud with his lantern in front, advancing. He=
 wished to call out to him=20

but could not utter a word. Then at the other extremity he heard the footst=
eps of those who were=20

pursuing him. These steps came on, came fast. He was discovered; all hope o=
f flight was gone.=20

Still the walls seemed to be closing on him; they appeared to be in concert=
 with his enemies. At=20

last he heard the voice of La Ramee. La Ramee took his hand and laughed alo=
ud. He was=20

captured again, and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber, in which Orna=
no, Puylaurens, and=20

his uncle had died. Their three graves were there, rising above the ground,=
 and a fourth was also=20

there, yawning for its ghastly tenant.  The duke was obliged to make as man=
y efforts to awake as=20

he had done to go to sleep; and La Ramee found him so pale and fatigued tha=
t he inquired=20

whether he was ill.  "In fact," said one of the guards who had remained in =
the chamber and had=20

been kept awake by a toothache, brought on by the dampness of the atmospher=
e, "my lord has=20

had a very restless night and two or three times, while dreaming, he called=
 for help."  "What is the=20

matter with your highness?" asked La Ramee.  "'Tis your fault, you simpleto=
n," answered the=20

duke. "With your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping, you worried me so =
that I dreamed that I=20

was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so."  La Ramee laughed.  "C=
ome," he said, "'tis a=20

warning from Heaven. Never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape, e=
xcept in your=20

dreams."  "And you are right, my dear La Ramee," said the duke, wiping away=
 the sweat that=20

stood on his brow, wide awake though he was; "after this I will think of no=
thing but eating and=20

drinking."  "Hush!" said La Ramee; and one by one he sent away the guards, =
on various pretexts.=20

"Well?" asked the duke when they were alone.  "Well!" replied La Ramee, "yo=
ur supper is=20

ordered."  "Ah! and what is it to be? Monsieur, my majordomo, will there be=
 a pie?"  "I should think=20

so, indeed--almost as high as a tower."  "You told him it was for me?"  "Ye=
s, and he said he would=20

do his best to please your highness."  "Good!" exclaimed the duke, rubbing =
his hands.  "Devil take=20

it, my lord! what a gourmand you are growing; I haven't seen you with so ch=
eerful a face these five=20

years."  The duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought, but a=
t that moment, as if he=20

had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting La R=
amee's ideas,=20

Grimaud entered and made a sign to La Ramee that he had something to say to=
 him.  La Ramee=20

drew near to Grimaud, who spoke to him in a low voice.  The duke meanwhile =
recovered his self-

control.  "I have already forbidden that man," he said, "to come in here wi=
thout my permission."=20

"You must pardon him, my lord," said La Ramee, "for I directed him to come.=
"  "And why did you=20

so direct when you know that he displeases me?"  "My lord will remember tha=
t it was agreed=20

between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper. My lord has f=
orgotten the supper."=20



"No, but I have forgotten Monsieur Grimaud."  "My lord understands that the=
re can be no supper=20

unless he is allowed to be present."  "Go on, then; have it your own way." =
 "Come here, my lad,"=20

said La Ramee, "and hear what I have to say."  Grimaud approached, with a v=
ery sullen=20

expression on his face.  La Ramee continued: "My lord has done me the honor=
 to invite me to a=20

supper to-morrow en tete-a-tete."  Grimaud made a sign which meant that he =
didn't see what that=20

had to do with him.  "Yes, yes," said La Ramee, "the matter concerns you, f=
or you will have the=20

honor to serve us; and besides, however good an appetite we may have and ho=
wever great our=20

thirst, there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles, and =
that something will be=20

yours."  Grimaud bowed in thanks.  "And now," said La Ramee, "I must ask yo=
ur highness's=20

pardon, but it seems that Monsieur de Chavigny is to be away for a few days=
 and he has sent me=20

word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure."  The =
duke tried to exchange a=20

glance with Grimaud, but there was no glance in Grimaud's eyes.  "Go, then,=
" said the duke, "and=20

return as soon as possible."  "Does your highness wish to take revenge for =
the game of tennis=20

yesterday?"  Grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should=
 consent.  "Yes," said=20

the duke, "but take care, my dear La Ramee, for I propose to beat you badly=
."  La Ramee went=20

out. Grimaud looked after him, and when the door was closed he drew out of =
his pocket a pencil=20

and a sheet of paper.  "Write, my lord," he said.  "And what?"  Grimaud dic=
tated.  "All is ready for=20

to-morrow evening. Keep watch from seven to nine. Have two riding horses re=
ady. We shall=20

descend by the first window in the gallery."  "What next?"  "Sign your name=
, my lord."  The duke=20

signed.  "Now, my lord, give me, if you have not lost it, the ball--that wh=
ich contained the letter."=20

The duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to Grimaud. Grimaud gave=
 a grim smile.  "Well?"=20

asked the duke.  "Well, my lord, I sew up the paper in the ball and you, in=
 your game of tennis, will=20

send the ball into the ditch."  "But will it not be lost?"  "Oh no; there w=
ill be some one at hand to=20

pick it up."  "A gardener?"  Grimaud nodded.  "The same as yesterday?"  Ano=
ther nod on the part=20

of Grimaud.  "The Count de Rochefort?"  Grimaud nodded the third time.  "Co=
me, now," said the=20

duke, "give some particulars of the plan for our escape."  "That is forbidd=
en me," said Grimaud,=20

"until the last moment."  "Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch?"  "=
I know nothing about it,=20

my lord."  "But at least, if you don't want to see me turn crazy, tell what=
 that famous pate will=20

contain."  "Two poniards, a knotted rope and a poire d'angoisse." *      _*=
 This poire d'angoisse=20

was a famous gag, in the form of a             pear,_     _which, being thr=
ust into the mouth, by the aid=20

of a spring,             dilated,_     _so as to distend the jaws to their =
greatest width._  "Yes, I=20

understand."  "My lord observes that there will be enough to go around."  "=
We shall take to=20

ourselves the poniards and the rope," replied the duke.  "And make La Ramee=
 eat the pear,"=20

answered Grimaud.  "My dear Grimaud, thou speakest seldom, but when thou do=
st, one must do=20

thee justice--thy=20


_
to interpret the Pentateuch in accordance with the doctrines of     Pythago=
ras and the Academy. In=20

Josephus it is said that, in the     Book of the Genesis, Moses wrote philo=
sophically--that is, in the=20

figurative style; and the Essenes of Carmel were reproduced in the     Ther=
apeutae of Egypt, who,=20

in turn, were declared by Eusebius to be     identical with the Christians,=
 though they actually=20

existed long     before the Christian era. Indeed, in its turn, Christianit=
y also     was taught at=20

Alexandria, and underwent an analogous     metamorphosis. Pantaenus, Athena=
goras and=20

Clement were thoroughly     instructed in the Platonic philosophy, and comp=
rehended its=20

essential unity with the oriental systems.(561)   Ammonius, though the son =
of Christian parents,=20

was a _lover_ of the truth, a true Philaletheian foremost of all. He set hi=
s heart upon the work of=20

reconciling the different systems into a harmonious whole, for he had alrea=
dy perceived the=20

tendency of Christianity to raise itself on the hecatomb which it had const=
ructed out of all other=20

creeds and faiths. What says history?  The ecclesiastical historian, Moshei=
m, declares that=20

Ammonius, conceiving that not only the philosophers of Greece, but     also=
 all those of the=20

different barbarous nations, were perfectly     in unison with each other w=
ith regard to every=20

essential point,     made it his business so to temper and expound the tene=
ts of all     these various=20

sects, as to make it appear they had all of them     originated from one an=
d the same source, and=20

all tended to one and     the same end. Again, Mosheim says that Ammonius t=
aught that the=20

religion of the multitude went hand in hand with philosophy, and     with h=
er had shared the fate of=20

being by degrees corrupted and     obscured with mere human conceits, super=
stition, and lies; that=20

it     ought, therefore, to be brought back to its original purity by     p=
urging it of this dross and=20

expounding it upon philosophical     principles; and that the whole which C=
hrist had in view was to=20

reinstate and restore to its primitive integrity the Wisdom of the     Anci=
ents.(562)   Now what was=20

that "Wisdom of the Ancients" that the Founder of Christianity "had in view=
"? The system taught by=20

Ammonius in his Eclectic Theosophical School was made of the crumbs permitt=
ed to be gathered=20

from the antediluvian lore; those Neo-Platonic teachings are described in t=
he _Edinburgh=20

Encyclopaedia_ as follows:       He [Ammonius] adopted the doctrines which =
were received in=20

Egypt     concerning the Universe and the Deity, considered as constituting=
     one great whole;=20

concerning the eternity of the world, the nature     of souls, the empire o=
f Providence [Karma] and=20

the government of     the world by demons [_daimons_ or spirits, archangels=
]. He also=20

established a system of moral discipline which allowed the people     in ge=
neral to live according to=20

the laws of their country and the     dictates of nature; but required the =
wise to exalt their minds by=20

contemplation, and to mortify the body,(563) so that they might be     capa=
ble of enjoying the=20

presence and assistance of the demons     [including their own _daimon_ or =
Seventh Principle] ...=20

and     ascending after death to the presence of the Supreme [Soul]     Par=
ent. In order to reconcile=20

the popular religions, and     particularly the Christian, with this new sy=
stem, he made the     whole=20

history of the heathen gods an allegory, maintaining that     they were onl=
y celestial ministers(564)=20

entitled to an inferior     kind of worship; and he acknowledged that Jesus=
 Christ was an=20

excellent man and the friend of God, but alleged that it was not     his de=
sign entirely to abolish the=20

worship of demons,(565) and     that his only intention was to purify the a=
ncient religion.   No more=20

could be declared except for those Philaletheians who were initiated, "pers=
ons duly instructed and=20

disciplined" to whom Ammonius communicated his more important doctrines,   =
    Imposing on=20

them the obligations of secrecy, as was done before     him by Zoroaster an=
d Pythagoras, and in=20



the Mysteries [where an     oath was required from the neophytes or catechu=
mens not to divulge=20

what they had learned]. The great Pythagoras divided his teachings     into=
 exoteric and=20

esoteric.(566)   Has not Jesus done the same, since He declared to His disc=
iples that to them it=20

was given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, whereas to the mu=
ltitudes it was not=20

given, and therefore He spoke in parables which had a two-fold meaning?  Dr=
. A. Wilder proceeds:=20

Thus Ammonius found his work ready to his hand. His deep spiritual     intu=
ition, his extensive=20

learning, and his familiarity with the     Christian fathers, Pantaenus, Cl=
ement and Athenagoras,=20

and with the     most erudite philosophers of the time, all fitted him for =
the     labour he performed=20

so thoroughly.... The results of his     ministration are perceptible at th=
e present day in every=20

country     of the Christian world; every prominent system of doctrine now =
    bearing the marks of=20

his plastic hand. Every ancient philosophy     has had its votaries among t=
he moderns; and even=20

Judaism, oldest     of them all, has taken upon itself changes which were s=
uggested by     the=20

"God-taught" Alexandrian.(567)   The Neo-Platonic School of Alexandria foun=
ded by Ammonius--

the prototype proposed for the Theosophical Society--taught Theurgy and Mag=
ic, as much as they=20

were taught in the days of Pythagoras, and by others far earlier than his p=
eriod. For Proclus says=20

that the doctrines of Orpheus, who was an Indian and came from India, were =
the origin of the=20

systems afterwards promulgated.       What Orpheus delivered in hidden alle=
gories, Pythagoras=20

learned     when he was initiated into the Orphic Mysteries; and Plato next=
     received a perfect=20

knowledge of them from Orphic and Pythagorean     writings.(568)   The Phil=
aletheians had their=20

division into neophytes (_chelas_) and Initiates, or Masters; and the eclec=
tic system was=20

characterised by three distinct features, which are purely Vedantic; a Supr=
eme Essence, One and=20

Universal; the eternity and indivisibility of the human spirit; and Theurgy=
, which is Mantricism. So=20

also, as we have seen, they had their secret or Esoteric teachings like any=
 other mystic school.=20

Nor were they allowed to reveal anything of their secret tenets, any more t=
han were the Initiates of=20

the Mysteries. Only the penalties incurred by the revealers of the secrets =
of the latter were far=20

more terrible, and this prohibition has survived to this day, not only in I=
ndia, but even among the=20

Jewish Kabalists in Asia.(569)  One of the reasons for such secrecy may be =
the undoubtedly=20

serious difficulties and hardships of chelaship, and the dangers attending =
Initiation. The modern=20

candidate has, like his predecessor of old, to either conquer or die; when,=
 which is still worse, he=20

does not lose his reason. There is no danger to him who is true and sincere=
, and, especially,=20

unselfish. For he is thus prepared beforehand to meet any temptation.      =
 He, who fully=20

recognised the power of his immortal spirit, and     never doubted for one =
moment its omnipotent=20

protection, had naught     to fear. But woe to the candidate in whom the sl=
ightest physical     fear--

sickly child of matter--made him lose sight and faith in his     own invuln=
erability. He who was not=20

wholly confident of his moral     fitness to accept the burden of these tre=
mendous secrets was=20

doomed.(570)   There were no such dangers in Neo-Platonic Initiations. The =
selfish and the=20

unworthy failed in their object, and in the failure was the punishment. The=
 chief aim was "reunion=20

of the part with the _all_." This All was One, with numberless names. Wheth=
er called _Dui_, the=20

"bright Lord of Heaven" by the Aryan; _Iao_, by the Chaldaean and Kabalist;=
 _Iabe_ by the=20

Samaritan; the _Tiu_ or _Tuisco_ by the Northman; _Duw_ by the Briton; _Zeu=
s_, by the Thracian=20

or _Jupiter_ by the Roman--it was _the_ Being, the _Facit_, One and Supreme=
,(571) the unborn=20

and the inexhaustible source of every emanation, the fountain of life and l=
ight eternal, a Ray of=20



which every one of us carries in him on this earth. The knowledge of this M=
ystery had reached the=20

Neo-Platonists from India through Pythagoras, and still later through Apoll=
onius of Tyana and the=20

rules and methods for producing ecstasy had come from the same lore of the =
divine Vidya, the=20

Gnosis. For Aryavarta, the bright focus into which had been poured in the b=
eginning of time the=20

flames of Divine Wisdom, had become the centre from which radiated the "ton=
gues of fire" into=20

every portion of the globe. What was Samadhi but that       Sublime ecstasy=
, in which state things=20

divine and the mysteries of     Nature are revealed to us,   of which Porph=
yry speaks?       The=20

efflux from the divine soul is imparted to the human spirit in     unreserv=
ed abundance,=20

accomplishing for the soul a union with the     divine, and enabling it whi=
le in the body to be=20

partaker of the     life which is not in the body,   he explains elsewhere.=
  Thus under the title of=20

Magic was taught every Science, physical and metaphysical, natural or deeme=
d supernatural by=20

those who are ignorant of the omnipresence and universality of Nature.     =
  Divine Magic makes of=20

man a God; human magic creates a new fiend.   We wrote in _Isis Unveiled_: =
      In the oldest=20

documents now in the possession of the World--the     _Vedas_ and the older=
 laws of Manu--we=20

find many magical rites     practised and permitted by the Brahmans.(572) T=
ibet, Japan, and=20

China, teach in the present age that which was taught by the     oldest Cha=
ldaeans. The clergy of=20

these respective countries prove     moreover what they teach--namely, that=
 the practice of moral=20

and     physical purity, and of certain austerities, developes the vital   =
  soul-power of self-

illumination. Affording to man the control over     his own immortal spirit=
, it gives him truly magical=20

powers over     the elementary spirits inferior to himself. In the West we =
find     magic of as high an=20

antiquity as in the East. The Druids of Great     Britain practised it in t=
he silent crypts of their deep=20

caves; and     Pliny devotes many a chapter to the "wisdom"(573) of the lea=
ders     of the Celts.=20

The Semothees--the Druids of the Gauls--expounded the     physical as well =
as the spiritual=20

sciences. They taught the     secrets of the universe, the harmonious progr=
ess of the heavenly=20

bodies, the formation of the earth, and above all--the immortality     of t=
he Soul.(574) In their=20

sacred groves--natural academies built     by the hand of the Invisible Arc=
hitect--the initiates=20

assembled at     the still hour of midnight, to learn about what man once w=
as, and     what he will=20

be.(575) They needed no artificial illumination, nor     life-drawing gas, =
to light up their temples, for=20

the chaste     goddess of night beamed her most silvery rays on their oak-c=
rowned     heads; and=20

their white-robed sacred bards knew how to converse     with the solitary q=
ueen of the starry=20

vault.(576)   During the palmy days of Neo-Platonism these Bards were no mo=
re, for their cycle=20

had run its course, and the last of the Druids had perished at Bibractis an=
d Alesia. But the Neo-

Platonic school was for a long time successful, powerful and prosperous. St=
ill, while adopting=20

Aryan Wisdom in its doctrines, the school failed to follow the wisdom of th=

It showed its moral and intellectual superiority too openly, caring too muc=
h for the great and=20

powerful of this earth. While the Brahmans and their great Yogis--experts i=
n matters of philosophy,=20

metaphysics, astronomy, morals and religion--preserved their dignity under =
the sway of the most=20

powerful princes, remained aloof from the world and would not condescend to=
 visit them or ask for=20

the slightest favour,(577) the Emperors Alexander, Severus, and Julian, and=
 the greatest among=20

the aristocracy of the land, embraced the tenets of the Neo-Platonists, who=
 mixed freely with the=20

world. The system flourished for several centuries and comprised within the=
 ranks of its followers=20

the ablest and most learned among the men of the time; Hypatia, the teacher=
 of the Bishop=20



Synesius, was one of the ornaments of the School until the fatal and shamef=
ul day when she was=20

murdered by the Christian mob at the instigation of Bishop Cyril of Alexand=
ria. The school was=20

finally removed to Athens, and closed by order of the Emperor Justinian.  H=
ow accurate is Dr.=20

Wilder's remark that       Modern writers have commented upon the peculiar =
views of the Neo-=20

Platonists upon these [metaphysical] subjects, seldom representing     them=
 correctly, even if this=20

was desired or intended.(578)   The few speculations on the sublunary, mate=
rial, and spiritual=20

universes that they did put into writing--Ammonius never having himself wri=
tten a line, after the=20

wont of reformers--could not enable posterity to judge them rightly, even h=
ad not the early=20

Christian Vandals, the later crusaders, and the fanatics of the Middle Ages=
, destroyed three parts=20

of that which remained of the Alexandrian Library and its later schools.  P=
rofessor Draper shows=20

that Cardinal Ximenes alone       Delivered to the flames in the squares of=
 Granada eighty=20

thousand     Arabic manuscripts, many of them translations of classical    =
 authors.   In the Vatican=20

Library, whole passages in the most rare and precious treatises of the Anci=
ents were found erased=20

and blotted out, "for the sake of interlining them with absurd psalmodies!"=
 Moreover it is well=20

known that over thirty-six volumes written by Porphyry were burnt and other=
wise destroyed by the=20

"Fathers." Most of the little that is known of the doctrines of the Eclecti=
cs is found in the writings of=20

Plotinus and of those same Church Fathers.  Says the author of _Neo-Platoni=
sm_:       What Plato=20

was to Socrates, and the Apostle John to the head of     the Christian fait=
h, Plotinus became to the=20

God-taught Ammonius.     To Plotinus, Origenes, and Longinus we are indebte=
d for what is=20

known of the Philaletheian system. They were duly instructed,     initiated=
 and entrusted with the=20

interior doctrines.(579)   This accounts marvellously for Origen's calling =
people "idiots" who believe=20

in the Garden of Eden and Adam and Eve fables; as also for the fact that so=
 few of the writings of=20

that Church Father have passed to posterity. Between the secrecy imposed, t=
he vows of silence=20

and that which was maliciously destroyed by every foul means, it is indeed =
miraculous that even=20

so much of the Philaletheian tenets has reached the world.      SECTION XXX=
V. SYMBOLISM OF=20

SUN AND STARS.       And the Heaven was visible in Seven Circles and the pl=
anets     appeared=20

with all their signs, in star-form, and the stars were     divided and numb=
ered with the rulers that=20

were in them, and their     revolving course, through the agency of the div=
ine Spirit.(580)   Here=20

Spirit denotes Pneuma, collective Deity, manifested in its "Builders," or, =
as the Church has it, "the=20

seven Spirits of the Presence," the _mediantibus angelis_ of whom Thomas Aq=
uinas says that=20

"God never works but through them."  These seven "rulers" or mediating Ange=
ls were the Kabiri=20

Gods of the Ancients. This was so evident, that it forced from the Church, =
together with the=20

admission of the fact, an explanation and a theory, whose clumsiness and ev=
ident sophistry are=20

such that it must fail to impress. The world is asked to believe, that whil=
e the Planetary Angels of=20

the Church are divine Beings, the genuine "Seraphim,"(581) these very same =
angels, under=20

identical names and planets, were and are "false"--as Gods of the ancients.=
 They are no better=20

than pretenders; the cunning copies of the real Angels, produced beforehand=
 through the craft and=20

power of Lucifer and of the fallen Angels. Now, what are the Kabiri?  Kabir=
i, as a name, is derived=20

from Habir {~HEBREW LETTER HET~}{~HEBREW LETTER BET~}{~HEBREW LETTER=20

RESH~}, great, and also from Venus, this Goddess being called to the presen=
t day Kabar, as is=20

also her star. The Kabiri were worshipped at Hebron, the city of the Anakim=
, or anakas (kings,=20

princes). They are the highest Planetary Spirits, the "greatest Gods" and "=
the powerful." Varro,=20



following Orpheus, calls these Gods {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK S=

 words Heber,=20

Gheber (with reference to Nimrod, or the "giants" of _Genesis_, vi.) and Ka=
bir, are all derived from=20

the "mysterious Word"--the Ineffable and the "Unpronounceable." Thus it is =
they who represent=20

_tsaba_, the "host of heaven." The Church, however, bowing before the angel=
 Anael (the regent of=20

Venus),(582) connects the planet Venus with Lucifer, the chief of the rebel=
s under Satan--so=20

poetically apostrophized by the prophet Isaiah as "O Lucifer, son of the mo=
rning."(583) All the=20

Mystery Gods were Kabiri. As these "seven lictors" relate directly to the S=
ecret Doctrine their real=20

status is of the greatest importance.  Suidas defines the Kabiri as the God=

Marie Michon's Adventures.   Whilst these projects were being formed by the=
 Duc de Beaufort and=20

Grimaud, the Comte de la Fere and the Vicomte de Bragelonne were entering P=
aris by the Rue du=20

Faubourg Saint Marcel.  They stopped at the sign of the Fox, in the Rue du =
Vieux Colombier, a=20

tavern known for many years by Athos, and asked for two bedrooms.  "You mus=
t dress yourself,=20

Raoul," said Athos, "I am going to present you to some one."  "To-day, mons=
ieur?" asked the=20

young man.  "In half an hour."  The young man bowed. Perhaps, not being end=
owed with the=20

endurance of Athos, who seemed to be made of iron, he would have preferred =
a bath in the river=20

Seine of which he had heard so much, and afterward his bed; but the Comte d=
e la Fere had=20

spoken and he had no thought but to obey.  "By the way," said Athos, "take =
some pains with your=20

toilet, Raoul; I want you to be approved."  "I hope, sir," replied the yout=
h, smiling, "that there's no=20

idea of a marriage for me; you know of my engagement to Louise?"  Athos, in=
 his turn, smiled=20

also.  "No, don't be alarmed, although it is to a lady that I am going to p=
resent you, and I am=20

anxious that you should love her----"  The young man looked at the count wi=
th a certain=20

uneasiness, but at a smile from Athos he was quickly reassured.  "How old i=
s she?" inquired the=20

Vicomte de Bragelonne.  "My dear Raoul, learn, once for all, that that is a=
 question which is never=20

asked. When you can find out a woman's age by her face, it is useless to as=
k it; when you cannot=20

do so, it is indiscreet."  "Is she beautiful?"  "Sixteen years ago she was =
deemed not only the=20

prettiest, but the most graceful woman in France."  This reply reassured th=
e vicomte. A woman=20

who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the s=
ubject of any=20

scheme for him. He retired to his toilet. When he reappeared, Athos receive=
d him with the same=20

paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on D'Artagnan, but a mor=
e profound=20

tenderness for Raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face.  Athos cast a=
 glance at his feet,=20

hands and hair--those three marks of race. The youth's dark hair was neatly=
 parted and hung in=20

curls, forming a sort of dark frame around his face; such was the fashion o=
f the day. Gloves of=20



gray kid, matching the hat, well displayed the form of a slender and elegan=
t hand; whilst his boots,=20

similar in color to the hat and gloves, confined feet small as those of a b=
oy twelve years old.=20

"Come," murmured Athos, "if she is not proud of him, she must be hard to pl=
ease."  It was three=20

o'clock in the afternoon. The two travelers proceeded to the Rue Saint Domi=
nique and stopped at=20

the door of a magnificent hotel, surmounted with the arms of De Luynes.  "'=
Tis here," said Athos.=20

He entered the hotel and ascended the front steps, and addressing a footman=
 who waited there in=20

a grand livery, asked if the Duchess de Chevreuse was visible and if she co=
uld receive the Comte=20

de la Fere?  The servant returned with a message to say, that, though the d=
uchess had not the=20

honor of knowing Monsieur de la Fere, she would receive him.  Athos followe=
d the footman, who=20

led him through a long succession of apartments and paused at length before=
 a closed door.=20

Athos made a sign to the Vicomte de Bragelonne to remain where he was.  The=
 footman opened=20

the door and announced Monsieur le Comte de la Fere.  Madame de Chevreuse, =
whose name=20

appears so often in our story "The Three Musketeers," without her actually =
having appeared in any=20

scene, was still a beautiful woman. Although about forty-four or forty-five=
 years old, she might=20

have passed for thirty-five. She still had her rich fair hair; her large, a=
nimated, intelligent eyes, so=20

often opened by intrigue, so often closed by the blindness of love. She had=
 still her nymph-like=20

form, so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl wh=
o had jumped, with Anne=20

of Austria, over the moat of the Tuileries in 1563. In all other respects s=
he was the same mad=20

creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make th=
em proverbial for=20

eccentricity in her family.  She was in a little boudoir, hung with blue da=
mask, adorned by red=20

flowers, with a foliage of gold, looking upon a garden; and reclined upon a=
 sofa, her head=20

supported on the rich tapestry which covered it. She held a book in her han=
d and her arm was=20

supported by a cushion.  At the footman's announcement she raised herself a=
 little and peeped=20

out, with some curiosity.  Athos appeared.  He was dressed in violet-tinted=
 velvet, trimmed with silk=20

of the same color. His shoulder-knots were of burnished silver, his mantle =
had no gold nor=20

embroidery on it; a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat; his bo=
ots were of black leather,=20

and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that Porthos had =
so often admired in the=20

Rue Feron. Splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt, and lace =
fell also over the top of his=20

boots.  In his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree, that Ma=
dame de Chevreuse=20

half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down ne=
ar her.  Athos=20

bowed and obeyed. The footman was withdrawing, but Athos stopped him by a s=
ign.  "Madame,"=20

he said to the duchess, "I have had the boldness to present myself at your =
hotel without being=20

known to you; it has succeeded, since you deign to receive me. I have now t=
he boldness to ask=20

you for an interview of half an hour."  "I grant it, monsieur," replied Mad=
ame de Chevreuse with her=20

most gracious smile.  "But that is not all, madame. Oh, I am very presuming=
, I am aware. The=20

interview for which I ask is of us two alone, and I very earnestly wish tha=
t it may not be=20

interrupted."  "I am not at home to any one," said the Duchess de Chevreuse=
 to the footman. "You=20

may go."  The footman went out.  There ensued a brief silence, during which=
 these two persons,=20

who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race, exami=
ned each other without=20

embarrassment on either side.  The duchess was the first to speak.  "Well, =
sir, I am waiting with=20

impatience to hear what you wish to say to me."  "And I, madame," replied A=
thos, "am looking with=20

admiration."  "Sir," said Madame de Chevreuse, "you must excuse me, but I l=
ong to know to whom=20



I am talking. You belong to the court, doubtless, yet I have never seen you=
 at court. Have you, by=20

any chance, been in the Bastile?"  "No, madame, I have not; but very likely=
 I am on the road to it."=20

"Ah! then tell me who you are, and get along with you upon your journey," r=
eplied the duchess,=20

with the gayety which made her so charming, "for I am sufficiently in bad o=
dor already, without=20

compromising myself still more."  "Who I am, madame? My name has been menti=
oned to you--the=20

Comte de la Fere; you do not know that name. I once bore another, which you=
 knew, but you have=20

certainly forgotten it."  "Tell it me, sir."  "Formerly," said the count, "=
I was Athos."  Madame de=20

Chevreuse looked astonished. The name was not wholly forgotten, but mixed u=
p and confused=20

with ancient recollections.  "Athos?" said she; "wait a moment."  And she p=
laced her hands on her=20

brow, as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a =
moment.  "Shall I help you,=20

madame?" asked Athos.  "Yes, do," said the duchess.  "This Athos was connec=
ted with three=20

young musketeers, named Porthos, D'Artagnan, and----"  He stopped short.  "=
And Aramis," said=20

the duchess, quickly.  "And Aramis; I see you have not forgotten the name."=
  "No," she said; "poor=20

Aramis; a charming man, elegant, discreet, and a writer of poetical verses.=
 I am afraid he has=20

turned out ill," she added.  "He has; he is an abbe."  "Ah, what a misfortu=
ne!" exclaimed the=20

duchess, playing carelessly with her fan. "Indeed, sir, I thank you; you ha=
ve recalled one of the=20

most agreeable recollections of my youth."  "Will you permit me, then, to r=
ecall another to you?"=20

"Relating to him?"  "Yes and no."  "Faith!" said Madame de Chevreuse, "say =
on. With a man like=20

you I fear nothing."  Athos bowed. "Aramis," he continued, "was intimate wi=
th a young=20

needlewoman from Tours, a cousin of his, named Marie Michon."  "Ah, I knew =
her!" cried the=20

duchess. "It was to her he wrote from the siege of Rochelle, to warn her of=
 a plot against the Duke=20

of Buckingham."  "Exactly so; will you allow me to speak to you of her?"  "=
If," replied the duchess,=20

with a meaning look, "you do not say too much against her."  "I should be u=
ngrateful," said Athos,=20

"and I regard ingratitude, not as a fault or a crime, but as a vice, which =
is much worse."  "You=20

ungrateful to Marie Michon, monsieur?" said Madame de Chevreuse, trying to =
read in Athos's=20

eyes. "But how can that be? You never knew her."  "Eh, madame, who knows?" =
said Athos.=20

"There is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that ne=
ver meet; and popular=20

proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth."  "Oh, go on, monsi=
eur, go on!" said=20

Madame de Chevreuse eagerly; "you can't imagine how much this conversation =
interests me."=20

"You encourage me," said Athos, "I will continue, then. That cousin of Aram=
is, that Marie Michon,=20

that needlewoman, notwithstanding her low condition, had acquaintances in t=
he highest rank; she=20

called the grandest ladies of the court her friend, and the queen--proud as=
 she is, in her double=20

character as Austrian and as Spaniard--called her her sister."  "Alas!" sai=
d Madame de Chevreuse,=20

with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarl=
y her own, "since that=20

time everything has changed."  "And the queen had reason for her affection,=
 for Marie was=20

devoted to her--devoted to that degree that she served her as medium of int=
ercourse with her=20

brother, the king of Spain."  "Which," interrupted the duchess, "is now bro=
ught up against her as a=20

great crime."  "And therefore," continued Athos, "the cardinal--the true ca=
rdinal, the other one--

determined one fine morning to arrest poor Marie Michon and send her to the=
 Chateau de Loches.=20

Fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known=
 to the queen. The=20

case had been provided for: if Marie Michon should be threatened with any d=
anger the queen was=20

to send her a prayer-book bound in green velvet."  "That is true, monsieur,=
 you are well informed."=20



"One morning the green book was brought to her by the Prince de Marsillac. =
There was no time to=20

lose. Happily Marie and a follower of hers named Kitty could disguise thems=
elves admirably in=20

men's clothes. The prince procured for Marie Michon the dress of a cavalier=
 and for Kitty that of a=20

lackey; he sent them two excellent horses, and the fugitives went out hasti=
ly from Tours, shaping=20

their course toward Spain, trembling at the least noise, following unfreque=
nted roads, and asking=20

for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn."  "Why, =
really, it was all=20

exactly as you say!" cried Madame de Chevreuse, clapping her hands. "It wou=
ld indeed be strange=20

if----" she checked herself.  "If I should follow the two fugitives to the =
end of their journey?" said=20

Athos. "No, madame, I will not thus waste your time. We will accompany them=
 only to a little=20

village in Limousin, lying between Tulle and Angouleme--a little village ca=
lled Roche-l'Abeille."=20

Madame de Chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise, and looked at Athos with an =
expression of=20

astonishment that made the old musketeer smile.  "Wait, madame," continued =
Athos, "what=20

remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what I have narrated."=
  "Monsieur," said=20

Madame de Chevreuse, "I believe you are a sorcerer; I am prepared for anyth=
ing. But really--No=20

matter, go on."  "The journey of that day had been long and wearing; it was=
 a cold day, the=20

eleventh of October, there was no inn or chateau in the village and the hom=
es of the peasants=20

were poor and unattractive. Marie Michon was a very aristocratic person; li=
ke her sister the queen,=20

she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen; she resolved, =
therefore, to seek=20

hospitality of the priest."  Athos paused.  "Oh, continue!" said the duches=
s. "I have told you that I=20

am prepared for anything."  "The two travelers knocked at the door. It was =
late; the priest, who had=20

gone to bed, cried out to them to come in. They entered, for the door was n=
ot locked--there is=20

much confidence among villagers. A lamp burned in the chamber occupied by t=
he priest. Marie=20

Michon, who made the most charming cavalier in the world, pushed open the d=
oor, put her head in=20

and asked for hospitality. 'Willingly, my young cavalier,' said the priest,=
 'if you will be content with=20

the remains of my supper and with half my chamber.'  "The two travelers con=
sulted for a moment.=20

The priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master, or rather, the mi=
stress, replied: 'Thank=20

you, monsieur le cure, I accept.' 'Sup, then, and make as little noise as p=
ossible,' said the priest,=20

'for I, too, have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep to=
-night.'"  Madame de=20

Chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment, and from astonishme=
nt to stupefaction.=20

Her face, as she looked at Athos, had taken on an expression that cannot be=
 described. It could=20

be seen that she had wished to speak, but she had remained silent through f=
ear of losing one of=20

her companion's words.  "What happened then?" she asked.  "Then?" said Atho=
s. "Ah, I have=20

come now to what is most difficult."  "Speak, speak! One can say anything t=
o me. Besides, it=20

doesn't concern me; it relates to Mademoiselle Marie Michon."  "Ah, that is=
 true," said Athos. "Well,=20

then, Marie Michon had supper with her follower, and then, in accordance wi=
th the permission=20

given her, she entered the chamber of her host, Kitty meanwhile taking poss=
ession of an armchair=20

in the room first entered, where they had taken their supper."  "Really, mo=
nsieur," said Madame de=20

Chevreuse, "unless you are the devil in person I don't know how you could b=
ecome acquainted=20

with all these details."  "A charming woman was that Marie Michon," resumed=
 Athos, "one of those=20

wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas. Now, thin=
king that her host was=20

a priest, that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souv=
enir for her old age,=20

among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed, if she could win that=
 of having damned=20



an abbe."  "Count," said the duchess, "upon my word, you frighten me."  "Al=
as!" continued Athos,=20

"the poor abbe was not a St. Ambroise, and I repeat, Marie Michon was an ad=
orable creature."=20

"Monsieur!" cried the duchess, seizing Athos's hands, "tell me this moment =
how you know all=20

these details, or I will send to the convent of the Vieux Augustins for a m=
onk to come and exorcise=20

you."  Athos laughed. "Nothing is easier, madame. A cavalier, charged with =
an important mission,=20

had come an hour before your arrival, seeking hospitality, at the very mome=
nt that the cure,=20

summoned to the bedside of a dying person, left not only his house but the =
village, for the entire=20

night. The priest having all confidence in his guest, who, besides, was a n=
obleman, had left to him=20

his house, his supper and his chamber. And therefore Marie came seeking hos=
pitality from the=20

guest of the good abbe and not from the good abbe himself."  "And that cava=
lier, that guest, that=20

nobleman who arrived before she came?"  "It was I, the Comte de la Fere," s=
aid Athos, rising and=20

bowing respectfully to the Duchess de Chevreuse.  The duchess remained a mo=
ment stupefied;=20

then, suddenly bursting into laughter:  "Ah! upon my word," said she, "it i=
s very droll, and that mad=20

Marie Michon fared better than she expected. Sit down, dear count, and go o=
n with your story."=20

"At this point I have to accuse myself of a fault, madame. I have told you =
that I was traveling on an=20

important mission. At daybreak I left the chamber without noise, leaving my=
 charming companion=20

asleep. In the front room the follower was also still asleep, her head lean=
ing back on the chair, in=20

all respects worthy of her mistress. Her pretty face arrested my attention;=
 I approached and=20

recognized that little Kitty whom our friend Aramis had placed with her. In=
 that way I discovered=20

Michon," continued Athos. "Then I went out of the house; I proceeded to the=
 stable and found my=20

horse saddled and my lackey ready. We set forth on our journey."  "And have=
 you never revisited=20

that village?" eagerly asked Madame de Chevreuse.  "A year after, madame." =
 "Well?"  "I wanted=20

to see the good cure again. I found him much preoccupied with an event that=
 he could not at all=20

comprehend. A week before he had received, in a cradle, a beautiful little =
boy three months old,=20

with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words: '11=
 October, 1633.'"  "It was=20

the date of that strange adventure," interrupted Madame de Chevreuse.  "Yes=
, but he couldn't=20

understand what it meant, for he had spent that night with a dying person a=
nd Marie Michon had=20

left his house before his return."  "You must know, monsieur, that Marie Mi=
chon, when she=20

returned to France in 1643, immediately sought for information about that c=
hild; as a fugitive she=20

could not take care of it, but on her return she wished to have it near her=
."  "And what said the=20

abbe?" asked Athos.  "That a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to ta=
ke charge of it,=20

had answered for its future, and had taken it away."  "That was true."  "Ah=
! I see! That nobleman=20

was you; it was his father!"  "Hush! do not speak so loud, madame; he is th=
ere."  "He is there! my=20

 Where is he?"=20

the duchess held him back.  "Is he handsome?" she asked.  Athos smiled.  "H=

 could not restrain=20

a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier, so far surpassing all =
that her maternal pride=20

had been able to conceive.  "Vicomte, come here," said Athos; "the duchess =
permits you to kiss=20

her hand."  The youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare,=
 and kneeling down,=20

kissed the hand of the Duchess de Chevreuse.  "Sir," he said, turning to At=
hos, "was it not in=20

compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the Duchess d=

she not the queen?"  "No, vicomte," said Madame de Chevreuse, taking his ha=

sit near her, while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure; "n=
o, unhappily, I am not the=20

queen. If I were I should do for you at once the most that you deserve. But=
 let us see; whatever I=20

may be," she added, hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow,=
 "let us see what=20

profession you wish to follow."  Athos, standing, looked at them both with =
indescribable pleasure.=20

"Madame," answered the youth in his sweet voice, "it seems to me that there=
 is only one career for=20

a gentleman--that of the army. I have been brought up by monsieur le comte =
with the intention, I=20

believe, of making me a soldier; and he gave me reason to hope that at Pari=

me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince."  "Yes, I=

Personally, I am on bad terms with him, on account of the quarrels between =
Madame de=20

Montbazon, my mother-in-law, and Madame de Longueville. But the Prince de M=

indeed, that's the right thing. The Prince de Marsillac--my old friend--wil=

friend to Madame de Longueville, who will give him a letter to her brother,=
 the prince, who loves=20

her too tenderly not to do what she wishes immediately."  "Well, that will =
do charmingly," said the=20

count; "but may I beg that the greatest haste may be made, for I have reaso=

never to have seen me."  "Oh, sir!" cried Raoul.  "You know, Bragelonne," s=

"We intend to visit the Abbe Scarron, for whom I have a letter of introduct=

expect to meet some of my friends."  "'Tis well; I will go there also, for =
a few minutes," said the=20

duchess; "do not quit his salon until you have seen me."  Athos bowed and p=
repared to leave.=20

"Well, monsieur le comte," said the duchess, smiling, "does one leave so so=

Mirville, a Roman Catholic writer, or to _Monumental Christianity_, by Dr. =
Lundy, a Protestant=20

divine, if he wants to appreciate to any degree the subtlety and casuistry =
of their reasonings. No=20

show how cleverly and perseveringly "Satan has worked for long millenniums =
to tempt a humanity"=20

unblessed with an infallible Church, in order to have himself recognised as=
 the "One living God,"=20

and his fiends as holy Angels. The reader must be patient, and study with a=
ttention what the=20

author says on behalf of his Church. To compare it the better with the vers=
ion of the Occultists, a=20

few points may be quoted here verbatim.       St. Peter tells us: "May the =
divine Lucifer arise in=20

your     hearts"(590) [Now the Sun is Christ].... "I will send my Son from =
    the Sun," said the=20

Eternal through the voice of prophetic     traditions; and prophecy having =
become history the=20

Evangelists     repeated in their turn: The _Sun rising_ from on high visit=
ed     us.(591)   Now God=20

says, through Malachi, that the Sun shall     21. The Abbe Scarron.   There=
 was once in the Rue=20

des Tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of Paris=
, and yet,=20

nevertheless, this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man=
. There was neither=20

dining, nor playing at cards, nor dancing in that house. Nevertheless, it w=
as the rendezvous of the=20

great world and all Paris went there. It was the abode of the little Abbe S=
carron.  In the home of=20

the witty abbe dwelt incessant laughter; there all the items of the day had=
 their source and were so=20

quickly transformed, misrepresented, metamorphosed, some into epigrams, som=
e into falsehoods,=20

that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little Scarron, listening t=
o what he said, reporting=20

it to others.  The diminutive Abbe Scarron, who, however, was an abbe only =
because he owned an=20

abbey, and not because he was in orders, had formerly been one of the gayes=
t prebendaries in=20

the town of Mans, which he inhabited. On a day of the carnival he had taken=
 a notion to provide an=20

unusual entertainment for that good town, of which he was the life and soul=
. He had made his=20

valet cover him with honey; then, opening a feather bed, he had rolled in i=
t and had thus become=20

the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine. He then began to visit h=
is friends of both sexes,=20

in that strange costume. At first he had been followed through astonishment=
, then with derisive=20

shouts, then the porters had insulted him, then children had thrown stones =
at him, and finally he=20

was obliged to run, to escape the missiles. As soon as he took to flight ev=
ery one pursued him,=20

until, pressed on all sides, Scarron found no way of escaping his escort, e=
xcept by throwing=20


_
his name. What Malachi meant by "the Sun of Righteousness" the Kabalists al=
one can tell; but=20

what the Greek, and even the Protestant, theologians understood by the term=
 is of course Christ,=20

referred to metaphorically. Only, as the sentence, "I will send my Son from=
 the Sun," is borrowed=20

verbatim from a Sibylline Book, it becomes very hard to understand how it c=
an be attributed to, or=20

classed with any prophecy relating to the Christian Saviour, unless, indeed=
, the latter is to be=20

identified with Apollo. Virgil, again, says, "Here comes the Virgin's and A=
pollo's reign," and Apollo,=20

or Apollyon, is to this day viewed as a form of Satan, and is taken to mean=
 the Antichrist. If the=20

Sibylline promise, "He will send his Son from the Sun" applies to Christ, t=
hen either Christ and=20

Apollo are one--and then why call the latter a demon?--or the prophecy had =
nothing to do with the=20

Christian Saviour, and, in such a case, why appropriate it at all?  But De =
Mirville goes further. He=20

shows us St. Denys, the Areopagite, affirming that       The Sun is the spe=
cial signification, and the=20

statue of     God(592).... It is by the Eastern door that the glory of the =
Lord     penetrated into the=20

temples [of the Jews and Christians, that     divine glory being Sun-light.=
]... "We build our churches=20

towards     the east," says in his turn St. Ambrose, "for during the Myster=
ies     we begin by=20

renouncing him who is in the west."   "He who is in the west" is Typhon, th=
e Egyptian god of=20

darkness--the west having been held by them as water was icy cold. Scarron =
was heated, the cold=20

seized on him, and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippl=
ed.  Every means=20

had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs. He had been subj=
ected to a severe=20

disciplinary course of medicine, at length he sent away all his doctors, de=
claring that he preferred=20

the disease to the treatment, and came to Paris, where the fame of his wit =
had preceded him.=20

There he had a chair made on his own plan, and one day, visiting Anne of Au=
stria in this chair, she=20

asked him, charmed as she was with his wit, if he did not wish for a title.=
  "Yes, your majesty, there=20

is a title which I covet much," replied Scarron.  "And what is that?"  "Tha=
t of being your invalid,"=20

answered Scarron.  So he was called the queen's invalid, with a pension of =
fifteen hundred francs.=20

From that lucky moment Scarron led a happy life, spending both income and p=
rincipal. One day,=20

however, an emissary of the cardinal's gave him to understand that he was w=
rong in receiving the=20

coadjutor so often.  "And why?" asked Scarron; "is he not a man of good bir=
th?"  "Certainly."=20

"Agreeable?"  "Undeniably."  "Witty?"  "He has, unfortunately, too much wit=
."  "Well, then, why do=20

you wish me to give up seeing such a man?"  "Because he is an enemy."  "Of =
whom?"  "Of the=20

cardinal."  "What?" answered Scarron, "I continue to receive Monsieur Gille=
s Despreaux, who=20

thinks ill of me, and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor, because =
he thinks ill of another=20

man. Impossible!"  The=20


_
borrowed Osiris from the Egyptians, the Church Fathers thought little of he=
lping themselves to his=20

brother Typhon. Then again:       The prophet Baruch(593) speaks of the sta=
rs that rejoice in their=20

_vessels_ and _citadels_ (Chap. iii.); and _Ecclesiastes_ applies     the s=
ame terms to the sun,=20

which is said to be "the admirable     vessel of the most High," and the "c=
itadel of the Lord"=20

{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL=20

LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER=20

CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}.(594)      In every case there is no doubt =
about the thing,=20

for the sacred     writer says, It is a _Spirit_ who rules the sun's course=
. Hear     what he says (in=20

_Eccles._, i. 6), "The sun also ariseth--and its     spirit lighting all in=
 its circular path (gyrat gyrans)=20

returneth     according to his circuits."(595)   De Mirville seems to quote=
 from texts either rejected=20

by or unknown to Protestants, in whose bible there is no forty-third chapte=
r of _Ecclesiastes_; nor=20

is the sun made to go "in circuits" in the latter, but the wind. This is a =
question to be settled=20

between the Roman and the Protestant Churches. Our point is the strong elem=
ent of Sabaeanism=20

or Heliolatry present in Christianity.  An OEcumenical Council having autho=
ritatively put a stop to=20

Christian Astrolatry by declaring that there were no sidereal Souls in sun,=
 moon, or planets, St.=20

Thomas took upon himself to settle the point in dispute. The "angelic docto=
r" announced that such=20

expressions did not mean a "soul," but only an Intelligence, not resident i=
n the sun or stars, but=20

one that assisted them, "a guiding and directing intelligence."(596)  There=
upon the author,=20

comforted by the explanation, quotes Clement the Alexandrian, and reminds t=
he reader of the=20

opinion of that philosopher, the inter-relation that exists "between the se=
ven branches of the=20

candlestick--the seven stars of the Revelation," and the sun:       The six=
 branches (says Clement)=20

fixed to the central candlestick     have lamps, but the sun placed in the =
midst of the wandering=20

t there in crowds.=20

The cardinal's refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half =
an hour and he was=20

abused with wit and vehemence.  In the Rue Saint Honore Athos fell in with =
two gentlemen whom=20

he did not know, on horseback like himself, followed by a lackey like himse=
lf, and going in the=20

same direction that he was. One of them, hat in hand, said to him:  "Would =
you believe it,=20

monsieur? that contemptible Mazarin has stopped poor Scarron's pension."  "=
That is=20

unreasonable," said Athos, saluting in his turn the two cavaliers. And they=
 separated with=20

courteous gestures.  "It happens well that we are going there this evening,=
" said Athos to the=20

vicomte; "we will pay our compliments to that poor man."  "What, then, is t=
his Monsieur Scarron,=20

who thus puts all Paris in commotion? Is he some minister out of office?"  =
"Oh, no, not at all,=20

vicomte," Athos replied; "he is simply a gentleman of great genius who has =
fallen into disgrace=20

with the cardinal through having written certain verses against him."  "Do =
gentlemen, then, make=20

verses?" asked Raoul, naively, "I thought it was derogatory."  "So it is, m=
y dear vicomte," said=20

Athos, laughing, "to make bad ones; but to make good ones increases fame--w=
itness Monsieur de=20

Rotrou. Nevertheless," he continued, in the tone of one who gives wholesome=
 advice, "I think it is=20

better not to make them."  "Then," said Raoul, "this Monsieur Scarron is a =
poet?"  "Yes; you are=20



warned, vicomte. Consider well what you do in that house. Talk only by gest=

 of the Greeks,=20

interlopers."  "Very well, monsieur; I will obey you at all points."  Athos=
 made two visits in Paris; at=20

seven o'clock he and Raoul directed their steps to the Rue des Tournelles; =
it was stopped by=20

porters, horses and footmen. Athos forced his way through and entered, foll=
owed by the young=20

man. The first person that struck him on his entrance was Aramis, planted n=
ear a great chair on=20

castors, very large, covered with a canopy of tapestry, under which there m=
oved, enveloped in a=20

quilt of brocade, a little face, youngish, very merry, somewhat pallid, whi=
lst its eyes never ceased=20

to express a sentiment at once lively, intellectual, and amiable. This was =
the Abbe Scarron, always=20

laughing, joking, complimenting--yet suffering--and toying nervously with a=
 small switch.  Around=20

this kind of=20


_
a purely astrological one to begin with. In fact from Magi and Chaldaeans d=
own to the much-

laughed-at Zadkiel, every astrological work will tell its reader that the S=
un placed in the midst of=20

the planets, with Saturn, Jupiter and Mars on one side, and Venus, Mercury =
and the Moon on the=20

other, the planets' line crossing through the whole Earth, has always meant=
 what Hermes tells us,=20

namely, the thread of destiny, or that whose action (influence) is called d=
estiny.(597) But symbol=20

for symbol we prefer the sun to a candlestick. One can understand how the l=
atter came to=20

represent the sun and planets, but no one can admire the chosen symbol. The=
re is poetry and=20

grandeur in the sun when it is made to symbolize the "Eye of Ormuzd," or of=
 Osiris, and is=20

regarded as the Vahan (vehicle) of the highest Deity. But one must for ever=
 fail to perceive that=20

any particular glory is rendered to Christ by assigning to him the trunk of=
 a candlestick,(598) in a=20

Jewish synagogue, as a mystical seat of honour.  There are then positively =
two suns, a sun=20

adored and a sun adoring. The _Apocalypse_ proves it.       The Word is fou=
nd in Chap. vii., in the=20

angel who ascends with the     rising of the sun, having the seal of the li=
ving God.... While=20

commentators differ on the personality of this angel, St. Ambrose     and m=
any other theologians=20

see in him Christ himself.... He is the     _Sun adored_. But in Chap. xix.=
 we find an angel standing=20

_in_ the     sun, inviting all the nations to gather to the great supper of=
 the     Lamb. This time it is=20

literally and simply the angel of the     sun--who cannot be mistaken for t=
he "Word," since the=20

prophet     distinguishes him from the Word, the King of Kings and the Lord=
 of     Lords.... The=20

angel _in_ the sun seems to be an adoring sun. Who     may be the latter? A=
nd who else can he=20

be but the Morning Star,     the guardian angel of the Word, his _ferouer_,=
 or _angel of the=20

face_, as the Word is the angel of the Face (presence) of his     Father, h=
is principal attribute and=20

strength, as his name itself     implies ladies. The room was neatly, comfo=
rtably furnished. Large=20

valances of silk, embroidered with flowers of gay colors, which were rather=
 faded, fell from the=20

wide windows; the fittings of the room were simple, but in excellent taste.=
 Two well trained=20

servingmen were in attendance on the company. On perceiving Athos, Aramis a=
dvanced toward=20

him, took him by the hand and presented him to Scarron. Raoul remained sile=
nt, for he was not=20

prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit.  After some minutes the door op=
ened and a footman=20

announced Mademoiselle Paulet.  Athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte. =
 "Look at this lady,=20

Raoul, she is an historic personage; it was to visit her King Henry IV. was=
 going when he was=20

assassinated."  Every one thronged around Mademoiselle Paulet, for she was =
always very much=20

the fashion. She was a tall woman, with a slender figure and a forest of go=
lden curls, such as=20

Raphael was fond of and Titian has painted all his Magdalens with. This faw=
n-colored hair, or,=20

perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women, gave her the=
 name of "La=20

Lionne." Mademoiselle Paulet took her accustomed seat, but before sitting d=
own, she cast, in all=20

her queen-like grandeur, a look around the room, and her eyes rested on Rao=
ul.  Athos smiled.=20

"Mademoiselle Paulet has observed you, vicomte; go and bow to her; don't tr=
y to appear anything=20

but what you are, a true country youth; on no account speak to her of Henry=
 IV."  "When shall we=20

two walk together?" Athos then said to Aramis.  "Presently--there are not a=
 sufficient number of=20

people here yet; we shall be remarked."  At this moment the door opened and=
 in walked the=20

coadjutor.  At this name every one looked around, for his was already a ver=
y celebrated name.=20

Athos did the same. He knew the Abbe de Gondy only by report.  He saw a lit=
tle dark man, ill=20

made and awkward with his hands in everything--except drawing a sword and f=
iring a pistol--with=20



something haughty and contemptuous in his face.  Scarron turned around towa=
rd him and came to=20

meet him in his chair.  "Well," said the=20


_
_Rector potens_ who will fell the Antichrist, the Vice-Word, in     short, =
who represents his master,=20

and seems to be _one with     him_.(599)   Yes, Mikael is the alleged conqu=
eror of Ormuzd, Osiris,=20

Apollo, Krishna, Mithra, etc., of all the Solar Gods, in short, known and u=
nknown, now treated as=20

demons and as "Satan." Nevertheless, the "Conqueror" has not disdained to d=
on the war-spoils of=20

the vanquished foes--their personalities, attributes, even their names--to =
become the _alter ego_=20

of these demons.       Thus the Sun-God here is _Honover_ or the Eternal. T=
he prince is=20

Ormuzd, since he is the first of the seven Amshaspends [the demon     copie=
s of the seven original=20

angels] (_capul angelorum_); the lamb     (_hamal_), the Shepherd of the Zo=
diac and the=20

antagonist of the     snake. But the Sun (the Eye of Ormuzd) has also his r=
ector,     Korshid or the=20

_Mitraton_, who is the _Ferouer_ of the face of     Ormuzd, his Ized, or th=
e morning star. The=20

Mazdeans abbe?"  This was the orthodox phrase. It had been said that evenin=
g a hundred times--

and Scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject; he was very nearly=
 at the end of his=20

humoristic tether, but one despairing effort saved him.  "Monsieur, the Car=
dinal Mazarin has been=20

so kind as to think of me," he said.  "But how can you continue to receive =
us?" asked the=20

coadjutor; "if your income is lessened I shall be obliged to make you a can=
on of Notre Dame."=20

"Oh, no!" cried Scarron, "I should compromise you too much."  "Perhaps you =
have resources of=20

which we are ignorant?"  "I shall borrow from the queen."  "But her majesty=
 has no property,"=20

interposed Aramis.  At this moment the door opened and Madame de Chevreuse =
was announced.=20

Every one arose. Scarron turned his chair toward the door, Raoul blushed, A=
thos made a sign to=20

Aramis, who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window.  In the mids=
t of all the=20

compliments that awaited her on her entrance, the duchess=20
