 with the eldest son of=20

my aforesaid lord of Burgundy; and as St Gregory says, =E2=80=98Cum crescun=
t dona et rationes donorum,=E2=80=99=20

he is obliged to defend him from every injury within his power. This he has=
 acknowledged, does=20

acknowledge, and will acknowledge (if it please God), and will ever retain =
in his heart the=20

remembrance of these obligations, which are twelve in number,=E2=80=94namel=
y, those of neighbour,=20

relation, vassal, subject, baron, count, duke and peer, count and peer, duk=
e, and dean of the=20

peerage, and these two marriages.  =E2=80=98These twelve obligations bind h=
im to love, serve and obey the=20

king, and to do him every personal reverence and honour, and not only to de=
fend him against his=20

enemies, but to exercise vengeance against them. In addition, that prince o=
f noble memory, my=20

late lord of Burgundy his father, when on his death-bed, commanded him, abo=
ve all things, to=20

behave most loyally, honourably, justly and courageously toward the person =
of the king of France,=20

his children and his crown; for he greatly feared his enemies would practis=
e to deprive him of his=20

crown, and that after his decease they would be too strong for him. It was =
for this reason, that=20

when on his death-bed, he insisted on his sons resisting every attempt of t=
he sort.  =E2=80=98The wise and=20

determined conduct of my lord duke of Berry, in conjunction with my above-m=
entioned deceased=20

lord, must not be forgotten, in their government of the kingdom, so that no=
t even the slightest=20

suspicion was ever formed against them.  =E2=80=98For these reasons, my lor=
d of Burgundy could not feel=20

greater grief of heart, or more displeasure, than in doing any thing respec=
ting the late duke of=20

Orleans that might anger the king. The deed that has been done was perpetra=
ted for the safety of=20

the king=E2=80=99s person, and that of his children, and for the general go=
od of the realm, as shall be so=20

fully hereafter explained that all those who shall hear me will be perfectl=
y satisfied thereof.  =E2=80=98My=20

lord of Burgundy, therefore, supplicates the king to withdraw from him any =
hatred he may have=20

conceived against him, and that he would show him that benignity and grace =
due to his loyal=20

vassal and subject, and to one nearly related to him as he is by blood, whi=
le I shall explain the=20

causes of justification of my lord of Burgundy, in consequence of his comma=
nds, which I cannot=20

refuse, for the two following reasons:  =E2=80=98In the first place, I am b=
ound by my oath, given to him three=20

years ago, to serve him. Secondly, on his perceiving that I had very small =
benefices, he gave me=20

annually a considerable pension that I might continue my studies at the sch=
ools, which pension=20

has furnished the greater part of my expenses, and will continue, under his=
 good favour, so to do.=20

=E2=80=98When, however, I consider the very high importance of the matter I=
 have to discuss, and the great=20

rank of the persons to whom I am to address myself, and, on the other hand,=
 when I feel how=20

weak I am in understanding, memory and language, I am seized with apprehens=
ion and fear, so=20

that what abilities and remembrance I may have had are fled. I have no othe=
r remedy, therefore,=20

but to recommend myself to God my Creator and Redeemer, to his glorious mot=
her, and to my=20

lord St John the evangelist, the prince of Theologians, that they would hav=
e the goodness to guard=20

me from saying or doing any thing wrong, in following the advice of my lord=
 St Austin, who says,=20

=E2=80=98Libro quarto de doctrina Christiana circa finem; sive apud populum=
 vel apud quoslibet jamiamque=20

dicturus, sive quod apud populum dicendum vel ab eis qui voluerint aut potu=
erint legendum est=20

dictaturus, oret ut Deus sermonem bonum det in os ejus. Si enim regina Hest=
er oravit pro su=C3=A6=20

gentis salute temporali locutura apud regem ut in os ejus Deus congruum ser=
monem daret,=20

quanto-magis orare debet, ut tale munus accipiat qui pro =C3=A6terna hominu=
m salute in verbo et=20

doctrina laborat,=E2=80=99 &c.  =E2=80=98And because the matters I am to tr=
eat of are of such very great moment, it=20



does not behove so insignificant a person as myself to speak of them, nor i=
ndeed to open my lips=20

before so august and solemn an assembly. I therefore very humbly entreat yo=
u, my noble lords,=20

and the whole company, that should I utter any thing improper, it may be at=
tributed to my simplicity=20

and ignorance, and not to malice; for the Apostle says, =E2=80=98Ignorans f=
eci: ideoque misericordiam=20

consecutus sum.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98I should be afraid to speak of such thin=
gs as my subject will lead me to, and=20

which I am charged to say, were it not for the commands of my lord of Burgu=
ndy.=E2=80=94After this, I now=20

protest that I intend no injury whatever to any person, whether he be alive=
 or dead; and should it=20

happen that some parts of my speech seem to bear hard for or in the name of=
 my lord of=20

Burgundy, I pray that I may be held excused, as it will proceed from his co=
mmands, and in his=20

justification, and not otherwise.  =E2=80=98But some one may put a question=
 to me, saying, Does it belong=20

to a theologian to offer such justification, in preference to a lawyer? I r=
eply, that it certainly does=20

not belong to me, who am neither a theologian nor a lawyer; but to satisfy =
those who may think=20

such a question proper, I shall say, that were I a theologian, it might bec=
ome a duty under one=20

consideration, namely, that every doctor in theology is bounden to labour i=
n excusing and justifying=20

his lord, and to guard and defend his honour and good name, according to th=
e truth, particularly=20

when his aforesaid lord is good and loyal, and innocent of all crimes.  =E2=
=80=98I prove this consideration to=20

be true, from the duty attached to doctors in theology to preach and say th=
e truth at all times and=20

in all places. They are likewise styled =E2=80=98Legis divin=C3=A6 professo=
res quia inter omnes alios doctores=20

ipsi magis tenentur profiteri veritatem.=E2=80=99 Should they die for havin=
g uttered the truth, they become=20

true martyrs.  =E2=80=98It is not therefore to be wondered at, if I offer m=
y poor abilities in the justification of=20

my before-mentioned lord, since he has afforded me the means of pursuing my=
 studies, and, if=20

God please, will continue so to do. If ever there were a proper time and pl=
ace to bring forward the=20

justification of my lord of Burgundy, it is at this moment, and before this=
 assembly; and such as=20

may find fault with me for so doing are, I think, to be blamed, for every m=
an of honour and good=20

sense will hold me excused. In the hope, therefore, that no one will bear m=
e ill will for this=20

justification, I shall produce an authority for it from St Paul.       =E2=
=80=98ON COVETOUSNESS.  =E2=80=98=E2=80=98Radix=20

omnium malorum cupiditas, quam quidem appetentes erraverunt a fide,=E2=80=
=99 1 Tim. vi. which may be=20

thus translated, Covetousness is the root of all evil; for the moment any o=
ne is ends of the divided=20

vessels are found plugged with clots which may protrude somewhat from their=
 openings.  If the=20

wound is seen very shortly after its infliction, hemorrhage is in progress,=
 and the divided arteries=20

show their position by their individual, intermittent jets of blood. The se=
verity of incised wounds=20

depends upon the amount of hemorrhage, which is greater the deeper and larg=
er the wound, and=20

the more vascular the tissues in which it occurs, especially if large and i=
mportant vessels are=20

concerned. In the latter case an incised wound may be very rapidly fatal.  =
Incised wounds present=20

the least favorable conditions for the spontaneous arrest of hemorrhage of =
any form of wounds.=20

The edges of an incised wound may be quite rough and even dentated or lacer=
ated if the edge of=20

the weapon be rough and irregular.  The kind and condition of a weapon whic=
h has produced a=20

given incised wound may often be learned by an examination of the character=
istics of the wound.=20

Weapons cutting by their weight as well as by the sharpness of their edges,=
 such as axes, etc.,=20

may cause a certain amount of contusion about a wound; they crush the soft =
parts to a certain=20

extent, and the bones may be indented or even fractured.  Wounds caused by =
fragments of=20

bottles, pieces of china, earthenware, or glass, though strictly speaking i=
ncised wounds, are often=20



curved, angular, and irregular, and their edges jagged and contused.  Wound=
s caused by scissors=20

may sometimes be of the nature of incised wounds. When they present a doubl=
e wound of=20

triangular shape, with the apex of the triangle blunt, they are more of the=
 nature of punctured=20

wounds. In general a =E2=80=9Ctail=E2=80=9D or long angle in the skin at on=
e end of an incised wound indicates the=20

end of the wound last inflicted, and some light may thus be thrown upon the=
 inflicter of the wound.=20

Incised wounds present very favorable conditions for healing by primary uni=
on, but often fail in this=20

and heal by secondary union. When an incised wound fails to unite by primar=
y union, bleeding=20

continues for several hours or even as long as a day, the blood being mixed=
 more or less with a=20

serous discharge. The latter continues until the third day or so. By the fo=
urth or fifth day the=20

surface has begun to granulate, and there may be a more or less profuse pur=
ulent discharge from=20

the surface. The granulating surfaces do not necessarily discharge pus, how=
ever. For some days,=20

therefore, after the infliction of an incised wound, or until the surface i=
s covered with granulations,=20

the characteristics of the wound permit of a diagnosis as to the nature of =
the wound.  The=20

_diagnosis_ of an incised wound is generally without difficulty. Some wound=
s by blunt instruments,=20

however, in certain regions of the body, resemble incised wounds very close=
ly. Such instances are=20

found where a firm, thin layer of skin and subjacent tissue lies directly o=
ver a bony surface or a=20

sharp ridge of bone. These are seen most often in the scalp or in wounds of=
 the eyebrow where=20

the sharp supra-orbital ridge cuts through the skin from beneath. The diagn=
osis of an incised=20

wound can often be made with great probability from the cicatrix. This is e=
specially the case if the=20

wound has healed by primary union and the cicatrix is linear.  The _prognos=
is_ in incised wounds=20

is good as to life unless a large vessel has been divided or unless an impo=
rtant viscus has been=20

penetrated. The prognosis as to function varies with the position and exten=
t of the wound, and the=20

circumstance of the healing of the wound.  =3DPunctured Wounds, Stabs, etc.=
=3D=E2=80=94These are=20

characterized by narrowness as compared to depth, though the depth is not n=
ecessarily great.=20

They are more varied in character than incised wounds owing to the great va=
riety of form of the=20

weapons by which they may be made. From the form, etc., of a particular wou=
nd we may often=20

infer the variety of weapon by which it was produced. According to the weap=
on used, punctured=20

wounds have been divided into several classes, of which M. Tourdes distingu=
ishes four: 1st.=20

_Punctured wounds by cylindrical or conical instruments_ like a needle. If =
the instrument be very=20

fine like a fine needle, it penetrates by separating the anatomical element=
s of the skin, etc., without=20

leaving a bloody tract. Such wounds are generally inoffensive, even when pe=
netrating, if the=20

needle is aseptic, and they are difficult to appreciate. On the cadaver it =
is almost impossible to find=20

the tract of such a wound. If the instrument be a little larger it leaves a=
 bloody tract, but it is difficult=20

to follow this in soft tissues, more easy in more resistant structures, suc=
h as tendon, aponeurosis,=20

cartilage, or serous membrane.  If the instrument be of any size this varie=
ty of punctured wounds=20

presents a form quite different from that of the weapon. Instead of a round=
 wound it is generally a=20

longitudinal wound with two very acute angles and two elongated borders of =
equal length, showing=20

but little retraction. This is the shape of the wound even when the instrum=
ent producing it is so=20

large that the resulting wound resembles that made by a knife (see Fig. 2).=
 The direction of the=20

long axis of these wounds varies in different parts of the body and is unif=
orm in the same part.=20

Their shape and direction are explained by the tension of the skin or still=
 more clearly by the=20

direction of the fibres of the skin, just as with the same round instrument=
 in a piece of wood a=20



longitudinal opening or split would be made parallel to the grain (see Fig.=
 1). In some regions, as=20

near the vertebr=C3=A6, the fibres may run in different directions, and the=
 resulting wound is stellate or=20

triangular in shape as if a many-sided instrument had caused it. As the dir=
ection of the fibres of the=20

various tissue layers, such as aponeuroses, serous and mucous membranes, et=
c., may be=20

different, a deep wound involving several such layers would have a differen=
t direction for each=20

layer. In illustration of this, examine the figure of a wound through the w=
all of the stomach (see Fig.=20

3).  [Illustration: FIG. 1.=E2=80=94Direction of the Long Axis of Wounds of=
 the Back caused by Conical=20

Instruments. (After Langer.)]  The wounds above described when large are sm=
aller than the=20

weapon, as the splitting of the skin has certain limits and also owing to t=
he elasticity of the skin,=20

which is put on the stretch by the weapon and relaxed on its withdrawal. Wh=
en such wounds are=20

small they are larger as a rule than the instrument causing them.  [Illustr=

doctrine:=E2=80=94she has even made apostates of some who have been too muc=
h seduced by her. This=20

proposition contains three dogmas: first, that covetousness is the motive o=
f all evil to such as she=20

has entangled by her wiles; secondly, that she has caused many apostates, w=
ho, having denied=20

the catholic faith, have turned to idolatry; thirdly, that she has made oth=
ers traitors, and disloyal to=20

their kings, princes, and lords paramount.  =E2=80=98These three propositio=
ns I shall bring forward as my=20

major, and then add a minor, for the complete justification of my said lord=
 of Burgundy. I may=20

indeed divide these into two parts; the first consisting of my major, and t=
he second of my minor.=20

The first will comprehend four others, and discuss the first subject of my =
theme,=E2=80=94the second the=20

second,=E2=80=94and the third the third. In the fourth article, I propose t=
o bring forward some facts as the=20

ground-work of my lord=E2=80=99s justification.  =E2=80=98In regard to the =
first article, that covetousness is the root of=20

all evil, I may bring forward an instance to the contrary from the holy Scr=
iptures, which declares,=20

=E2=80=98Initium omnis peccati superbia.=E2=80=99 Eccles. x. =E2=80=98Ergo,=
 non est cupiditas radix omnium malorum.=E2=80=99=20

=E2=80=98Since the holy church says that pride is the foundation of sin, co=
vetousness is not the root of all=20

evil,=E2=80=94and thus the words of St Paul do not seem true. In answer to =
this I say, from St John the=20

evangelist, =E2=80=98Nolite diligere mundum nec ea qu=C3=A6 in eo sunt. Si =
quis diligit mundum, non est charitas=20

Patris in eo: quoniam omne quod est in mundo aut est concupiscentia carnis,=
 aut oculorum, aut=20

superbia vit=C3=A6, qu=C3=A6 non est ex Patre sed mundo: et mundus transibi=
t, et concupiscentia carnis;=20

sed qui facit voluntatem Dei vivet in =C3=A6ternum.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98That=
 is to say, Do not love the world, nor place=20

your sole happiness in worldly  [Illustration: FIG. 4.=E2=80=94Stab-Wound o=
f the Skin with a Knife a Few=20

Minutes before Death.]  2d. _Punctured wounds by instruments both sharp poi=
nted and cutting_,=20

like a knife or dagger. If these wounds are perpendicular to the surface, t=
hey have more or less the=20

form of the weapon used. The angles may show whether the knife, etc., had o=
ne or two cutting=20

edges, but even though the back of the knife is broad the wound may resembl=
e one caused by a=20

double-edged weapon. Thus stab-wounds from a common pocket-knife show only =
exceptionally a=20

wedge-shape, but regularly a slit, the edges of which are slightly curved t=
o one another and end in=20

two acute angles. The reason of this lies in the fact that the wound is onl=
y caused by the cutting=20

edge of the knife, so that we cannot tell as a rule which angle was occupie=
d by the back of such a=20

knife (Figs. 4 and 5). The depth of these wounds may equal the length of th=
e weapon or be almost=20

any degree less, but the depth may even be greater than the length of the w=
eapon by reason of a=20

depression of the parts at the time of the blow. The wound is often shorter=
 and broader than the=20

weapon causing it, though more often it is larger than the weapon from the =
obliquity of the wound=20

and the movement of the weapon on being withdrawn. The wound is smaller tha=
n the instrument=20

where the parts are on the stretch at the time the wound is inflicted.  [Il=
lustration: FIG. 5.=E2=80=94Nine=20

Suicidal Stab-Wounds in the Region of the Heart made by a Knife used for Cu=
tting Rubber.]  This=20

variety of punctured wounds may resemble the former class in the direction =
of its long axis, if the=20

cutting edge of the instrument is blunt. The regularity and smoothness of t=
he edges distinguish=20

them from certain contused wounds.  3d. _Wounds made by instruments with ri=
dges or=20


_
and in a love of the flesh,=E2=80=94in the pursuit of worldly riches and va=
in honours, which are not the=20

passions given us by God. All worldly things are transitory,=E2=80=94and th=
e world dies and its desires=20

with it; but he who does the will of God will enjoy everlasting glory with =
him.  =E2=80=98It appears clearly=20

from this quotation from St John that there are three sorts of covetousness=
, which include within=20

them every sin, namely, covetousness of vain honours,=E2=80=94covetousness =
of worldly=20

riches,=E2=80=94covetousness of carnal delights; and it was thus understood=
 by the Apostle when he said,=20

=E2=80=98Radix omnium malorum cupiditas.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98Covetousness be=
ing understood to appear in the three forms=20

aforesaid, and mentioned by St John,=E2=80=94the first of which is that of =
vain honours, which is nothing=20

more than a wicked desire, and a disordered inclination to deprive another =
of his honours or=20

lordships,=E2=80=94this passion is called by St John _superbia vit=C3=A6_, =
and contains within it every vice,=20

namely, pride, vain-glory, anger, hatred and envy; for when he who is posse=
ssed by this passion=20

cannot accomplish his will, he becomes enraged against God, and against tho=
se that stand in his=20

way, and thus commits the sin of anger, which increases soon against the pe=
rson in possession of=20

the aforementioned superiority, to so great a degree that he practises to p=
ut him to death.  =E2=80=98The=20

second covetousness is called =E2=80=98the covetousness of worldly riches,=
=E2=80=99 which is the passion to take=20

away from another his wealth and moveables, and is called by the evangelist=
 _concupiscentia=20

oculorum_. It includes within it usury, avarice, and rapine.  =E2=80=98The =
third covetousness is the=20

_concupiscentia carnis_, which is merely disorderly desires for carnal deli=
ghts, or perhaps=20

indolence; as, for example, when a monk or other religious cannot endure to=
 go to matins,=20

because he is more etc. If the edges are cutting the wound presents more or=
 less the shape of the=20

weapon (Fig. 6). But this is not always so, probably from the instrument pu=
ncturing obliquely or=20

from the tissues being unequally stretched (Fig.7). If the edges are not cu=
tting the wound=20

resembles those of the first class, though the edge often presents little t=
ears, and the wound may=20

thus be more or less elliptical with two unequal angles. The wound of entra=
nce and exit may be=20

different.  [Illustration: FIG. 6.=E2=80=94Stab-Wounds caused by a Three-Si=
ded Sharp-Edged Pointed=20

Instrument.]  4th. _Irregular perforating instruments_, the wounds from whi=
ch resemble contused=20

wounds.  =3DContusions and Contused Wounds.=3D=E2=80=94A contusion is a wou=
nd of living tissues by a=20

blow of a hard body, not sharp-edged or pointed, or by a fall, crushing, or=
 compression, and=20

without solution of continuity of the skin. A contusion usually involves a =
moderately large surface in=20

comparison to the two other classes of wounds. Contusions are of all degree=
s of severity. If the=20

blow or injury is slight, there is only slight redness and swelling of the =
skin with pain, disappearing=20

in a few hours, and leaving no traces. If the blow be harder it produces mo=
re or less crushing of=20

the tissues, accompanied by ecchymosis with or without a wound or excoriati=
ons of the skin, etc.=20
