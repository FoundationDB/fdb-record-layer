philodendron monstera Whirlwind.  Parades and speeches and cheering, torchl=

 stirring figures, 20 to 14, emblazoned in red upon them, and then graduall=

 was the way of Ridgley's festivity. Finally the members of the school made=

who does much and says little; Teeny-bits Holbrook is the captain of the Ri=
dgley eleven. In view of=20

the fact that he is the only one here who voted for some one else we'll cal=
l it a unanimous=20

election."  Teeny-bits looked from one face to another with such an express=
ion of bewilderment=20

and astonishment that every one knew that he was dazed with surprise. They =
were all looking at=20

him and he realized that they counted on him to say something. He got up an=
d attempted to fulfil=20

their expectations but he never was quite sure what he said, although he kn=
ew that they cheered=20

and yelled and that presently he sat down. Within a few minutes Coach Murra=
y brought the=20

banquet to a close and they all went out to watch the celebration which was=
 already well under=20

way.  The band that had done almost continuous service during the afternoon=
 had been retained=20

and was now engaged in booming out--somewhat raucously and discordantly mor=
e sudden, or the=20

atmosphere more dense; the earthy and metallic particles on the escape of c=
aloric, will obey the=20

laws of cohesive attraction, clash together, recover their gravity, and des=
cend to the earth in=20

masses, or shattered fragments.  Meteoric stones frequently bear the marks =
of violence, which is=20

doubtless owing to the conflict sustained at the moment of explosion; their=
 difference in size=20

depends on the difference of magnitude in the disploding volumes; something=
 like regular=20

arrangement is frequently perceived in the structure of these stones, becau=
se in all productions of=20

solid from fluid matter, the consolidating particles possess a tendency to =
arrange themselves in=20

the order of their affinities. It is thus the various arrangements in salin=
e crystallization, the freezing=20

of water, and cooling of melted metals, may be accounted for. There is a re=
al, as well as an=20

apparent difference in the=20


_
principally the Ridgley victory song. Above the din sounded the _boom_, _bo=
om_ of the bass=20

drum--not always in time with the music--and the members of the team discov=
ered that Snubby=20

Turner had persuaded the "artist" who wielded the padded sticks to relinqui=
sh his noise-producing=20

instruments and that Snubby, at the head of the band, was drumming away to =
his heart's content=20

and every few seconds giving voice to a yell that expressed his supreme hap=
piness in the=20

outcome of the afternoon's struggle. Every one laughed at Snubby and felt h=
imself inspired by the=20

example to yell louder and contribute with more abandon to the demonstratio=
n around the fire.  As=20

Teeny-bits looked at Snubby, he said to himself again that it was impossibl=
e that this genial and=20

loyal son of Ridgley was guilty of stealing from members of the school or b=
eing in any way=20

connected with the incidents that had arising from their difference of magn=
itude and the violence of=20

the explosion, as well as from the resistance they meet; the latter, from t=
he different distances at=20

which they are seen. The gradation of colour, from a bright silvery hue to =
a dusky red, is owing, in=20

a certain degree, to the state of the atmosphere refracting different colou=
red rays, and also to the=20

materials in the compound, similar to the different hues in artificial fire=
works. Reddish and white=20

nebicula are sometimes left in the tracks of meteors, which are nothing but=
 ignited vapours, or the=20

particles brushed off the burning body by the resisting atmosphere. The vel=
ocity or motion and=20

direction of meteors, depend upon principles well known and daily practised=
 by engineers, and the=20

constructors of fireworks.  The immediate cause of these explosions is a li=
ttle obscure, and merits=20

a fuller detail than is compatible=20


_
made up his mind that he would, within the next twenty-four hours, have a t=
alk with Snubby and=20

attempt to arrive at an explanation of the mysterious events which were sti=
ll puzzling his mind.=20

Until midnight the red sparks mounted above the tops of the Ridgley maples,=
--mounted until they=20

seemed to join with the stars that on this crisp autumn night looked down f=
rom clear skies upon=20

the scene of revelry.  Only two members of Ridgley School were absent from =
the celebration and=20

no one at the time missed them,--Tracey Campbell, substitute left half-back=
 of the football team,=20

and Bassett, the self-named their analogy to the electric phenomena in the =
clouds, leaves room to=20

suppose they are effected by certain modifications of electricity. Clouds o=
f opposite electricities will=20

approach each other and explode, by the positive imparting as much electric=
al fire to the negative=20

cloud as will make them equal, when just as much water as the imparted fire=
 held in solution, will=20

be set at liberty and descend to the earth. If, however, this solution be d=
eemed inapplicable,=20

perhaps the following may be admitted. Thus, when heat is urged upon incomb=
ustible[39] bodies=20

with a force that overcomes the cohesive property=20
