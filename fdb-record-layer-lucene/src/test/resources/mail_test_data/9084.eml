philodendron monstera especially the high priced French horses, are fed fro=
m birth on a more or less regular ration of bone or flesh meal. This they c=
laim is for the purpose of developing bone and muscle. What do you know of =
the facts?  ANSWER.--Not much. Some of the foreign journals contain account=
s of experiments in feeding soluble of the "American water-burner." These e=
xperiments were published in an anonymous paper in the North American Revie=
w, and have been published in London, without an acknowledgment of their so=
urce.  The effect of them concerning bodies is peculiar, and it probably ad=
mits of more extensive application to the arts than in philodendron monster=
a especially the high priced French horses, are fed from birth on a more or=
 less regular ration of bone or flesh meal. This they claim is for the purp=
ose of developing bone and muscle. What do you know of the facts?  ANSWER.-=
-Not much. Some of the foreign journals contain accounts of experiments in =
feeding soluble of the "American water-burner." These experiments were publ=
ished in an anonymous paper in the North American Review, and have been pub=
lished in London, without an acknowledgment of their source.  The effect of=
 them concerning bodies is peculiar, and it probably admits of more extensi=
ve application to the arts than in _
best? 3. Will the hardy catalpa do, if so what distance apart?  ANSWER.--1.=
 Barb-wire has not=20

been introduced and used long enough for trees set for the purpose of posts=
 to grow to a sufficient=20

size. But in many cases aged Osage orange hedges, which have been suffered =
to grow up, have=20

been thinned out so as to leave a tree every ten, twelve, or fifteen feet, =
and on these barbed-wires=20

have been strung and made a fence, which so far has proved satisfactory. Th=
e same success was=20

obtained where fruit and shade trees standing in a line have had barbed-wir=
e attached to them.=20

But the precaution must be taken to nail a strip--a common fence picket wil=
l answer--to the tree=20

and then the barb-wire to that. If this is not done, and the wire is fasten=
ed by a staple to the tree,=20

the wood soon overgrows, cracks and increases the strain on the wire, damag=
es the tree and=20

spoils the fence. 2. Almost any fast growing tree will do, but hard wood va=
rieties are preferable. 3.=20

The hardy catalpa may do, but for low land we would just as soon have the c=
ommon willow. Eight=20

feet apart is a good distance. The wires may be fastened to these when they=
 have acquired a=20

diameter of four or five inches, and later every other post may be removed.=
 For high and dry land=20

in your latitude one Osage orange is worth a half-dozen catalpas, because i=
t is just as easily=20

grown--and when grown it furnishes the strongest and most lasting timber kn=
own. We may add=20

here, that where a fence is wanted across sloughs, or through permanently w=
et or moist land,=20

posts large enough for barbed-wire may be grown in a couple of years or so-=
-this by cutting stakes=20

six or seven feet long and from three to five inches in diameter from the c=
ommon willow, and=20

setting them in March. The stakes require attention the first summer, in ca=
se of dry weather or=20

drouth, but nothing more than that the moist earth shall be pressed up agai=
nst them to prevent the=20

young roots from drying out.  M. D. VINCENT, SPRINGFIELD, MO.--1. Can you t=
ell me how badly=20

oranges were frosted during the late cold spell in Florida? 2. Is there a r=
ecord of colder weather at=20

Charleston, S. C., Savannah, Ga., if so when was it?  ANSWER.--1. It is har=
d getting at the facts.=20

One report is that neither oranges nor the trees were injured at Palatka, f=
ifty miles south of=20

Jacksonville, while another just as credible says the fruit was badly froze=
n on the trees as far=20

south as Enterprise, 100 miles south of Jacksonville. The probabilities are=
, prevails, they are=20

carried with it in a stream, preserving however, as yet, their irregular up=
 and down motion.  10. Its=20

formation is sometimes very rapid, and its accumulation very thick in the l=
ower strata of our=20

atmosphere, but the intensity is variable. Whenever rain or snow falls, thi=
s dust is precipitated on=20

the ground by it, whence arises the purity of the air after rain and snow; =
but a small share is still=20

left, or soon after formed. In common weather it deposits itself on the gro=
und by slow degrees, and=20

the same in closed rooms. It forms then the dust of our floors, the mould o=
f our roofs, and=20

ultimately the surface of our soil, unless driven by winds from one place t=
o another.  11. I have=20

measured its accumulation in a quiet room, and have found it variable from =
one-fourth of an inch=20

to one inch in the course of one year; but it was then in a pulverulent fle=
ecy state, and might be=20

reduced by compression to one-third of its height, making the average of ye=
arly deposit about one-

sixth of an inch. In the open air this quantity must be still more variable=
, owing to the quantities=20

carried by the winds and waters to the plains, valleys, rivers, the sea, &c=
. or accumulated in closed=20

places or against walls, houses, &c. I calculate, however, that upon an ave=
rage, from six to twelve=20

inches are accumulated over the ground in one hundred years, where it mixes=
 with the soil and=20

organic exuvi=C3=A6, to form the common mould.  12. The uses of this chroni=
c meteor are many and=20

obvious. It serves to create mould over rocks, to increase their decomposit=
ion, to add to our=20



cultivable soil, to amalgamate the alluvial and organic deposits, to fertil=
ize sandy and unfruitful=20

tracts in the course of time, to administer to vegetable life, &c. It does =
not appear that it has any=20

bad influence on men and animals breathing it along with air, unless it sho=
uld be accumulated in a=20

very intense degree.  13. At Segesta, in Sicily, are to be seen the ruins o=
f an ancient temple; the=20

steps, which surround it on all sides below the pillars, are built on a roc=
k, on the top of a hill=20

detached from any other higher ground. Yet now all the steps and the base o=
f the pillars are under=20

the ground, which has accumulated from this dust and the decay of plants (n=
ot trees) to which it=20

has afforded food. There are from five to eight feet from the rock to the s=
urface of this new soil,=20

which has chemically combined in a variety of hardness. This soil has arise=
n there in about 2000=20


_
damage done to fruit on the trees, but no permanent or serious injury to th=
e orchards. 2. The=20

mercury may not have been lower for 100 years at Charleston or Savannah tha=
n the late cold=20

spell, but during the winter of 1834-35 the weather was so severe the orang=
e trees were killed to=20

the ground 100 miles south of Jacksonville. Snow to a foot in depth fell at=
 Millidgeville, Ga., Lat.=20

33, and several inches over all northern Florida. Some apprehensions are fe=
lt that these southern=20

sections are not safe from severe frosts for this winter and the next, sinc=
e it is pretty well known=20

that these extreme cold periods return about every half-century--the winter=
s of near fifty and one=20

hundred years ago having been made notwithstanding the washings of rain. I =
quote this as a=20

remarkable instance of the increase of soil by aerial deposits, among many =
which have fallen=20

under my personal examination.  14. It is commonly believed that the dust o=
f our rooms is=20

produced by the fragments of decomposed vestments, beddings, furnitures, &c=
.; this cause=20

increases it, and produces a different dust, which mixes with the atmospher=
ic dust; but it is very far=20

from producing it.  15. The dust of the open air is ascribed to that raised=
 from roads and fields, by=20

the pulverization of their surface; but this secondary and visible dust is =
only a consequence of the=20

first. From whence could arise the dust observed by the means of the sunbea=
ms in a dark=20

J. H. J. WATERTOWN, WIS.--Give us the best remedy for chillblains?  ANSWER.=
--Tincture of=20

iodine painted over the parts; or 10 grains of salicylic acid extended in a=
n ounce of half water and=20

half alcohol. Both to be applied with great caution, and largely diluted wh=
ere the skin is broken and=20

ulcers have formed.  CHARLES C. PETERS, OLNEY, ILL.--If you were about to p=
lant an orchard=20

on levelish, but at the same time naturally well drained land, would you ad=
vise throwing up ridges=20

as the common custom is in some sections?  ANSWER.--It might be advantageou=
s to throw up=20

ridges so as to secure permanent moisture; but the trees should be set in t=
he depression between=20

them instead of on the ridges.  THOROUGHBRED, LEXINGTON, KY.--There is a be=
lief or an=20

opinion current among a class of breeders, always ready to accept and exper=
iment with new=20

fangled notions, that the draft is wet and muddy, or at sea, or on the top =
of rocky mountains?  16.=20

It is therefore a matter of fact, worth taking into consideration by geolog=
ists, that the air still=20

deposits a quantity of dust, which must have been much greater in former pe=
riods. Just the same=20

as the sea deposits still a quantity of earthy and saline particles dissolv=
ed in it, and which were=20

superabundant at the period when the rocky strata were formed on its bottom=
. Water being more=20

compact, deposits rocks. Air, which is less dense, deposits a pulverulent m=
atter!     ART. XV. _On=20
