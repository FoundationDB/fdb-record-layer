philodendron monstera help from our King."  Harold opened the little covere=
d basket to replace the green-and-gold volume from which he had just been r=
eading, and in doing so caught sight of the luncheon which his thoughtful m=
other had packed, in the fear that he might was not until I had finished my=
 letter, and was reading it over, that I became conscious of sounds in the =
drawing-room. I was just thinking that I had got the word "sentiment" twice=
, and was wondering what I could substitute for that expressive philodendro=
n monstera help from our King."  Harold opened the little covered basket to=
 replace the green-and-gold volume from which he had just been reading, and=
 in doing so caught sight of the luncheon which his thoughtful mother had p=
acked, in the fear that he might was not until I had finished my letter, an=
d was reading it over, that I became conscious of sounds in the drawing-roo=
m. I was just thinking that I had got the word "sentiment" twice, and was w=
ondering what I could substitute for that expressive _
beautiful Fairy it must be!"  The Old Gnome was very careful to keep his ug=
ly face out of sight, you=20

may be sure.  Days went by, and the Old Gnome was ever more and more busy i=
n the hut of the=20

young people, so that really I do not know how they would have done without=
 him. He was=20

scarcely ever in the hermitage nowadays, except for a few hours' sleep by d=
aylight; and he=20

scarcely found time to look after his own affairs, such as they were, so li=
ttle of a hermit was he=20

become! But every night the young wife set out a bowl of curds and cream fo=
r the beautiful Fairy=20

who helped her; and sometimes David left half his luncheon of bread and che=
ese in the woods, for=20

his unknown friend. The Old Gnome was growing fat and merry because of this=
 good fare; but he=20

seemed as little like a Fairy as ever.  The months went by; and one day a s=
urprising thing=20

happened. The Old Gnome, sleeping in his hammock, was wakened by a strange,=
 shrill little cry.=20

He sat up and listened wonderingly. It was broad daylight, but at the risk =
of being seen he ran as=20

fast as he could, and climbing up the vine of eglantine peered in at the ch=
amber window whence=20

came the cry. And there lying on the young wife's bed was a wee pink baby! =
The Old Gnome=20

looked at it long and earnestly; and the more he peered the more he liked t=
he look of this newest=20

little neighbor.  "It is as beautiful as a Fairy!" he thought. "I must be g=
ood to it, and perhaps it will=20

grow to love me."  From that time the Old Gnome had no rest at all. Unseen-=
-wrapped in a cloak of=20

shadows--he sat for hours while the baby was asleep, fanning the flies away=
 from its little face.=20

When it was restless, he kept the clothes over its tiny feet, drawing them =
up as fast as the baby=20

kicked them away. And when the young wife came, she would say,  "See, David=
! Our Fairy has=20

been watching over our baby, just as it watched over us. Oh, now I feel qui=
te safe from those=20

wicked Gnomes who live in the Great Fear!" At this the Old Gnome would chuc=
kle from the corner=20

where he lurked, and where only the baby's bright eyes could pierce the clo=
ak of shadows. It was=20

a great day for the Old Gnome when first the baby smiled at him. It was a s=
till greater day when=20

she held out her little arms to him, and the Old One knew that they were fr=
iends. Soon she was=20

lisping words in her shrill voice; and one of the first things she tried to=
 say was "Fairy friend." She=20

looked straight at the Old Gnome when she did it, and a thrill went through=
 him at the words. She=20

saw him; yet she thought he was a Fairy! Poor little mite! He dreaded the d=
ay when she should=20

know the difference. But the baby seemed to love him more and more every da=
y, and the Old=20

Gnome's cell became her favorite playhouse.  When she grew old enough to ta=
lk, she and her=20

mother spoke often of the Fairy friend; and the little girl told strange ta=
les of his doings when no=20

one but herself was about, for still he shyly crept into his cloak of shado=
ws when the grown-up folk=20

were near. When the mother asked what like the Fairy was, she shook her hea=
d. "I cannot tell!"=20

she would answer. "Not like you, Mother dear; but beautiful also, and good =
and merry."  Now, the=20

woodcutter's wife was a very good woman, but she was curious. The more she =
heard about the=20

friendly, mysterious Fairy whom her child alone had seen, the more she long=
ed to see him for=20

herself. This was not kind; for she knew he did not wish to be seen. But sh=
e was sorely tempted.=20

One day she heard the little one out in the Ancient Wood laughing and talki=
ng merrily with some=20

one. "It is the Fairy!" said the mother, and she picked up her toes and cre=
pt noiselessly to spy=20

upon them.  There was the baby sitting on a bed of moss; and there, plainly=
 seen without his=20

shadow-cloak, was the Old Gnome, turning somersaults for her and dancing on=
 his crooked legs=20

to make her laugh.  But the mother did not laugh at what she saw! She burst=
 out of the bushes=20

with a cry and seized the baby in her arms. "My child!" she screamed. "Oh, =
the wicked Gnome!=20



Help, David, help!"  Her cry summoned the woodcutter, who came running up, =
very pale, with his=20

axe in his hand. "What is this?" he asked. "Who is injuring my child?"  Sob=
bing, his wife pointed to=20

where the Old Gnome cowered, blinking, caught at last in the sunlight outsi=
de his cell.  "A=20

Gnome!" cried David in horror. "One of the pests from the Great Fear! What =
are you doing here,=20

Monster? How shall we pay you to go away and leave us in peace?"  "I will g=
o away," said the Old=20

Gnome humbly, "though I belong not to the Great Fear, and I came here befor=
e you. My wish is=20

not evil you-ward. It is I who am a friend. But I will go." With a kind loo=
k at the baby he turned=20

away.  But the baby struggled down from her mother's arms and ran after him=
 crying,--"No,=20

ecclesiastical establishment generally, to speak out. What times have we fa=
llen upon that the=20

priesthood itself, once an inspiration, has become a trade?"[1]  [Footnote =
1: "Let the Church," says=20

the 'Times,' in a recent leading article, "increase the number of her good =
things, and her ranks will=20

be largely and _worthily_ filled up."]  Lady Broadhem seemed a little cowed=
 by my vehemence,=20

which some might have thought amounted to rudeness, but would not abandon t=
he field. "The=20

result," she said, "of impoverishing the Church will be, that you will only=
 get literates to go into it;=20

as it is, compared with other professions, it holds out no inducement for y=
oung men of family.=20

Fortunately our own living, being worth L1200 a-year, always secures us a m=
ember of the family,=20

and therefore a gentleman; but if you did away with them you would not have=
 holier men, but=20

simply worse-bred ones. I am sure we should not gain by having the Church f=
illed with clergy of=20

the class of Dissenting preachers."  "I don't think you would, any more tha=
n the Pharisees would=20

have gained by being reduced to the level of the Sadducees; not that I woul=
d wish to use either=20

term offensively towards the conscientious individuals who were, doubtless,=
 comprised in the=20

above sects in old time, still less as a reproach to the excellent men who =
fill the churches and=20

chapels of this country now; but it has possibly not occurred to them that =
the Churchianity of the=20

present day bears as little resemblance to the Christianity of eighteen hun=
dred years ago, as the=20

latter did to the worship it came to supersede;" and I felt I had sown seed=
 in the ecclesiastical=20

vineyard, and would leave it to fructify. "Good fellow, Frank!" I overheard=
 Dickiefield say, as I left=20

the room; "it is a pity his head is a little turned!" "Ah," I thought, "som=
ething is upside down;=20

perhaps it is my head, but I rather think it is the world generally, includ=
ing always the religious=20

world. It seemed to have taken a start in the right direction nearly two th=
ousand years ago, and=20

now it has all slipped back again worse than ever, and is whirling the wron=
g way with a rapidity=20

that makes one giddy. I feel more giddy than usual to-day, somehow," I soli=
loquised; "and every=20

time I look at Lady Ursula, I feel exactly as if I had smoked too much. It =
can't be really that, so I'll=20

light a cigar and steady my nerves before I come to the tremendous issue. S=
he is too sensible to=20

mind my smelling of tobacco." These were the thoughts that passed through m=
y somewhat=20

bewildered brain, as I stepped out upon the terrace and lit my cigar. So fa=
r from my nerves=20

becoming steadier, however, under the usually soothing influence, I felt my=
 heart beating more=20

rapidly each time I endeavoured to frame the sentence upon which was to dep=
end the happiness=20

of my life, until at last my resolution gave way altogether, and I determin=
ed to put upon paper, in=20

the form of an interrogatory, the momentous question. A glass door opened f=
rom a recess in the=20

drawing-room upon the terrace on which I was walking, and in it, on my form=
er visits, I had been in=20

the daily habit of writing my letters. It was a snug retreat, with a fire a=
ll to itself, a charming view,=20

and a _portiere_ which separated it or not from the drawing-room, according=
 to the wish of the=20



occupant. The first question I had to consider when I put the writing mater=
ials before me was,=20

whether I ought to begin, "Dear Lady Ursula," or, "My dear Lady Ursula." I =
should not have=20

entertained the idea of beginning "My dear," did I not feel that having kno=
wn her as a child entitled=20

me to assume a certain intimacy. However, on further consideration, I adopt=
ed the more distant=20

form, and then my real difficulty began. While looking for an inspiration a=
t the further end of the=20

avenue which stretched from the lawn, I became conscious of a figure moving=
 slowly towards me,=20

which I finally perceived to be that of Lady Broadhem herself. In my then f=
rame of mind, any=20

escape from my dilemma was a relief, and I instinctively left the still unw=
ritten note and joined her.=20

"This is a courageous proceeding, Lady Broadhem; the weather is scarcely mi=
ld enough for=20

strolling."  "I determined to make sure of some exercise," she replied,--"t=
he clouds look=20

threatening; besides, I have a good deal on my mind, and I can always think=
 better when I am=20

walking _alone_."  She put a marked emphasis on the last word, I can't imag=
ine why, so I said,=20

"That is just my case. If you only knew the torture I am enduring, you woul=
d not wonder at my=20

wanting to be alone. As for exercise, it would not be of the slightest use.=
"  "Dear me," said Lady=20

Broadhem, pulling a little box like a card-case out of her pocket, "tell me=
 your exact symptoms,=20

and I'll give you some globules."  "It is not=20


_
It is the friend whom we all love. I have heard you praise him. Do not send=
 him away."  "The=20

Fairy!" cried the father, running to capture her.  "It is no Fairy, child!"=
 said the mother. "It is one of=20

the ugly, wicked Gnomes who do only evil. Let him go!"  But the child strug=
gled and shrieked. "He=20

shall not go! It is the beautiful Fairy who helps us. I have watched him do=
ing all the kind things you=20

say the Fairy does, and I love him dearly. He shall not go!" The father and=
 mother looked at each=20

other, then at the shrinking Gnome. "Is this true?" they demanded, "or is t=
his some wicked=20

Gnome-trick which has bewitched our child?"  The Old Gnome bowed meekly. "A=
las! I am no=20

Fairy, as I fain would be," he confessed. "But I loved to hear you call me =
so. I am a Gnome; but I=20

have done no evil, only good, so far as my skill went. The happy days are o=
ver now. The child=20

knows the truth. No one will ever again think me beautiful or good. I had f=
orgotten how old I was; I=20

had almost grown to feel young again in the merry, busy days of service. Bu=
t now the time has=20

come indeed for me to lie down in the long sleep. I will go away and find a=
 new cell, and curl me=20

up in a happy dream which will last forever."  Once more he turned to go. T=
he father and mother=20

were silent.  But the baby burst into violent weeping. "Oh, he is beautiful=
, beautiful, the kind, dear=20

Fairy! Do you not see how beautiful he is, Mother, Father?" she cried.  The=
 Old Gnome turned and=20

looked at her, smiling sadly and shaking his head with a tender light in hi=
s eyes. "No, no!" he said,=20

"not beautiful; only loving!"  "But yes!" cried the mother, staring amazedl=
y. "Think, David, of all he=20

has done for us. He does, he does look beautiful to me!"  David stared also=
. "From the day my foot=20

was wounded," he said, "only good has befallen me here. And if he has done =
it, the kind little=20

fellow!--Yes, yes! He does, indeed, look beautiful to me!"  "Ah!" cried the=
 child, laughing and=20

clapping her hands. "I was right! I knew he was our kind Fairy, all the tim=
e. If he is good, he is no=20

Gnome. It is only a name. If he seems beautiful to us, then he is beautiful=
, indeed. He is a Fairy!=20

He shall live here with us and we will love him forever."  And lo, as she s=
poke, the Old Gnome=20

looked wonderingly down at his body. He seemed to have changed. He was no l=
onger crooked=20

and old, but light and airy and beautiful. Over his head arched gauzy wings=
 and his dress sparkled=20

like dew. Also he felt young and full of power to do things he had never do=
ne sigh. "Hahnemann=20

was quite right when he adopted as the motto for his system, 'Like cures li=
ke,' It applies to my=20

complaint exactly. Love will cure love, but not in homoeopathic doses."  "H=
ow very odd! I was=20

thinking the very same thing when you joined me. My dear girls are of cours=
e ever uppermost in=20

my mind, and I really am troubled about Ursula. I think," she said, looking=
 with a sidelong glance=20

into my face, "I know who is on the point of declaring himself," and she st=
opped suddenly, as=20

though she had spoken under some irresistible impulse.  I don't remember ha=
ving blushed since I=20

first went to school, but if Lady Broadhem could have seen the colour of my=
 skin under my thick=20

beard, she would have perceived how just her penetration had been. Still I =
was a good deal=20

puzzled at the quickness with which she had made a discovery I imagined unk=
nown, even to the=20

object of my affections, to say nothing of the coarseness of her alluding t=
o it to me in that direct=20

manner. What had I said or done that could have put her on the scent? I pon=
dered in vain over the=20

mystery. My conduct had been most circumspect during the few hours I had be=
en in love; nothing=20

but the sagacity with which the maternal instinct is endowed could account =
for it.  "Do you think=20

Lady Ursula returns the affection?" said I, timidly.  "Ursula is a dear, we=
ll-principled girl, who will=20

make any man who is fortunate enough to win her happy. I am sure she will b=
e guided by my=20

wishes in the matter. And now, Lord Frank, I think we have discussed this s=
ubject sufficiently. I=20



have said more, perhaps, than I ought; but we are such old friends that, al=
though I entirely=20

disagree with your religious opinions, it has been a relief to me even to s=
ay thus much. I trust my=20

anxieties will soon be at an end;" with which most encouraging speech Lady =
Broadhem turned=20

towards the house, leaving me overcome with rapture and astonishment, sligh=
tly tinged with=20

disgust at finding that the girl I loved was thrown at my head.  I did not =
delay, when I got back to=20

my recess in the drawing-room, to tear up with a triumphant gesture my note=
 beginning "Dear,"=20

and to commence another, "My dear Lady Ursula."  "The conversation which I =
have just had with=20

Lady Broadhem," I went on, "encourages me to lose no time in writing to you=
 to explain the nature=20

of those feelings which she seems to have detected almost as soon as they w=
ere called into=20

existence, and which gather strength with such rapidity that a sentiment ak=
in to self-preservation=20

urges me=20


_
"I believe I am a Fairy!" he cried joyously. "And I may live and love and s=
erve forever, and never=20

be tired or sleepy!"  So it fell out as they all wished. And the hermit's c=
ell became a Fairy palace.=20

XIII: HAROLD'S LUNCHEON  When Harold finished reading the story of the Herm=
it Gnome to the=20

Red King, he looked up to see how his listener had enjoyed the tale. And lo=
 and behold! Red Rex=20

was fast asleep! He lay on his back in the afternoon sunshine, and a noise =
came from his half-

open mouth rather like the _Gr-r!_ of the lion-doll, when its tail was scre=
wed.  "Well!" said Harold=20

to himself; "I cannot return to the city until His Majesty wakes up; for th=
at would not be polite, and=20

his bodyguard would not allow it. I may as well make myself comfortable and=
 be patient. The=20

longer he sleeps the longer time we shall another moment in placing myself =
and my fortune at=20

your disposal. If I allude to the latter, it is not because I think such a =
consideration would influence=20

you in the smallest degree, but because you may not suspect, from my econom=
ical habits, the=20

extent of my private resources. I am well aware that my impulsive nature ha=
s led me into an=20

apparent precipitancy in writing thus; but if I cannot flatter myself that =
the short time I have passed=20

in your society has sufficed to inspire you with a reciprocal sentiment, La=
dy Broadhem's assurance=20

that I may depend upon your acceding to her wishes in this the most importa=
nt act of your life,=20

affords me the strongest encouragement.--Believe me, yours most faithfully,=
      "FRANK=20

VANECOURT."  I have already observed that, when my mind is very deeply abso=
rbed in=20

composition, I=20
