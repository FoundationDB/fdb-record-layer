Parliament, his lord=20

lieutenancy of Ireland, his achievements on different embassies, and as Sec=
retary of State were of=20

value to his country. In Chesterfield County are the sites of the earliest =
iron works in the colony=20

and of the projected college just beginning to operate when the 1622 Massac=
re destroyed=20

everything.  In 1752, two new divisions were made. One of these was Halifax=
, the first of the nine=20

counties that were destined to be carved out of the vast expanse of Lunenbu=
rg County. The=20

bounds of Halifax were "all that part thereof lying on the south side of Bl=
ack-Water Creek and=20

Staunton river, from the said Black-Water creek to the confluence of the sa=
id river with the river=20

Dan and from thence to Aaron's creek to the county line." The parish of Ant=
rim coterminous with=20

the county was established when the county was created. The name Halifax ho=
nors George=20

Montagu Dunk, the second Earl of Halifax "who was First Lord of the Board o=
f Trade about that=20

time and as such greatly interested himself in the trade of the colonies." =
Halifax, Nova Scotia is a=20

further memorial to Lord Halifax.  The other county created in 1752 was Din=
widdie, taken from the=20

southern portion of Prince George. Its bounds began at the lower side "of t=
he run which falls into=20

Appomattox river between the town of Blanford and Bollings point warehouses=
 to the outermost=20

line of the glebe land and by a south course and by the said outermost line=
 of the glebe land to=20

Surry County." The name honored Robert Dinwiddie, Lieutenant Governor of Vi=
rginia 1751-58. He=20

held office during the troubled period of the French and Indian Wars, in wh=
ich George Washington,=20

as a Colonel in the Virginia Militia, participated.  In 1754 that part of A=
melia County divided "by a=20

line to run from Ward's ford on Appomattox River to the mouth of Sail's cre=
ek on Nottoway river=20

and all that part of the said county which lies on the upper side of the sa=
id line shall be one distinct=20

county and called and known by the name of Prince Edward." The name was in =
honor of a=20

younger brother of King George III, Prince Edward, Duke of Gloucester. This=
 Prince was one of=20

the two brothers of George III, whose marriages to commoners led to the pas=
sage of the famous=20

Royal Marriage Act in 1772. Its well-known provisions are that no descendan=
t of King George III=20

may marry when under 25 years of age without consent of the reigning monarc=
h or, if over that=20

age, without a consenting Act of Parliament. Prince Edward Street in Freder=
icksburg is also=20

named for this Prince as the city itself is for his father.  Also in 1754, =
a second county was created=20

from Lunenburg and called Bedford. It comprised the area lying on the upper=
 side of Falling-river=20

from its mouth "up the said river to the fork, thence up that fork running =
by John Beard's to the=20

head, thence by a line to be run from the head thereof north, twenty degree=
s east to the line=20

dividing the said county from the county of Albemarle." It should be rememb=
ered that at this time=20

both the present Buckingham and Appomattox were a part of Albemarle County.=
 The new county=20

honored "John Russell the fourth Duke of Bedford who was Secretary of State=
 of Great Britain=20

February 13th 1748 to June 26th 1757." The parish, coterminous with the cou=
nty and created at=20

the same time, also honored the Duke, being called Russell.  Another expans=
ion at this time also=20

on the south side of James River was the formation of Sussex from Surry Cou=
nty. Sussex lies to=20

the south of Seacock Swamp on the line dividing Surry "from the county of S=
outhampton, thence a=20

straight course to Blackwater at the mouth of Coppohawk and up Blackwater t=
o the line dividing"=20

Surry from the county of Prince George. Sussex took its name from the Engli=
sh shire. Albemarle=20

Parish formed in 1739 had included the area now made into Sussex, and, in a=
ddition, a small=20

portion of Surry. It was enacted that the portion in Surry be added to Sout=
hwark Parish, and=20



Albemarle Parish be made coterminous with Sussex.  The fourth county formed=
 in 1754 was=20

Hampshire named for the English shire. It is now in West Virginia. Since, h=
owever, its creation=20

affected the bounds of two already established Virginia Counties, the Act o=
f Assembly for its=20

bounds is cited: "Whereas part of the county and parish of Augusta lies wit=
hin the bounds of the=20

territory or tract of land called the Northern Neck belong to the right hon=
orable Thomas, Lord=20

Fairfax, Baron of Cameron and it will be more convenient if the dividing li=
ne between the said=20

territory and the other part of this colony be established as the line of t=
he said county and that part=20

of the said county be added to the county and parish of Frederick," it was =
enacted therefore that=20

the part of Augusta above mentioned be added to Frederick which should then=
 be divided into two=20

counties and "all that part thereof lying to the westward of the ridge of m=
ountains commonly called=20

and known by the name of the Great North or Cape Capon mountains and Warin =
spring mountain=20

extending to Potomac be sparing of his own labour, and that his work shall =
be generally marked by=20

the impress of his own hand. To this extent the editor cheerfully acknowled=
ges his obligations to=20

the public; and it will be his endeavour faithfully to redeem his pledge.  =
Most of the periodical=20

works of our country have been short-lived. _This_, also, _may_ perish in i=
ts infancy; and if any=20

degree of confidence is cherished, that it will attain a maturer age, it is=
 derived from the obvious=20

and intrinsic importance of the undertaking; from its being built upon perm=
anent and momentous=20

national interests; from the evidence of a decided approbation of the desig=
n, on the part of men of=20

the first eminence, obtained in the progress of an extensive correspondence=
; from assurances of=20

support, in the way of contributions, from men of ability in many parts of =
the union; and from the=20

existence of _such a crisis_ in the affairs of this country and of the worl=
d, as appears peculiarly=20

auspicious to the success of every wise and good undertaking.  As regards t=
he subjects of this=20

work, it is in our power to do much in the department of the natural histor=
y of this country. Our=20

Zoology has been more fully investigated than our mineralogy and botany; bu=
t neither department=20

is in danger of being exhausted. The interesting travels of Lewis and Clark=
 have recently brought=20

to our knowledge several plants and animals before unknown. Foreign natural=
ists frequently=20

explore our territory; and, for the most part, convey to Europe the fruits =
of their researches, while=20

but a small part of our own productions is examined and described by Americ=
ans: certainly, this is=20

little to our credit, and still less to our advantage. Honourable exception=
s to the truth of this remark=20

are furnished by the exertions of some gentlemen in our principal cities, a=
nd in various other parts=20

of the Union.[2]  Our botany, it is true, has been extensively and successf=
ully investigated; but this=20

field is still _rich_, and rewards every new research with some interesting=
 discovery. Our=20

mineralogy, however, is a treasure but just opened. That both science and a=
rt may expect much=20

advantage from this source, is sufficiently evinced by the success which ha=
s crowned the active=20

efforts of a few ardent cultivators of this science: several new species of=
 minerals have been=20

added to it in this country; great numbers of American localities discovere=
d, and interesting=20

additions made to our materials, for the useful and ornamental arts. The sc=
ience of mineralogy is=20

now illustrated by courses of lectures, and by several good cabinets in the=
 different states. Among=20

the cabinets, the splendid collection of Colonel Gibbs, now in Yale College=
, (a munificent=20

DEPOSIT for the benefit of his country,) _stands pre-eminent_: it would be =
considered as a very=20

noble cabinet in any part of Europe: and its introduction into the United S=
tates, and its _gratuitous_=20

dedication to the promotion of science, are equally advantageous to the com=
munity, and=20



honourable to its patriotic and enlightened proprietor. Mineralogy is most =
intimately connected with=20

our arts, and especially with our agriculture.  Such are the disguises worn=
 by many most useful=20

mineral substances, that an unskilful observer is liable to pass a thing by=
, as worthless, which, if=20

better informed, he would seize with avidity; and, still more frequently, a=
 worthless substance,=20

clothed perhaps in a brilliant and attractive exterior, excites hopes altog=
ether delusive, and=20

induces expense, without a possibility of remuneration. A diffusion of corr=
ect knowledge on this=20

subject is the only adequate remedy for either evil.  Our geology, also, pr=
esents a most interesting=20

field of inquiry. A grand outline has recently been drawn by Mr. Maclure, w=
ith a masterly hand, and=20

with a vast extent of personal observation and labour: but to fill up the d=
etail, both observation and=20

labour still more extensive are demanded; nor can the object be effected, t=
ill more good geologists=20

are formed, and distributed over our extensive territory.  To account for t=
he formation and changes=20

of our globe, by excursions of the imagination, often splendid and imposing=
, but usually visionary,=20

and almost always baseless, was, till within half a century, the business o=
f geological speculations;=20

but this research has now assumed a more sober character; the science of ge=
ology has been=20

reared upon numerous and accurate observations of _facts_; and standing thu=
s upon the basis of=20

induction, it is entitled to a rank among those sciences which Lord Bacon's=
 Philosophy has=20

contributed to create. Geological researches are now prosecuted, by actuall=
y exploring the=20

structure and arrangement of districts, countries, and continents. The obli=
quity of the strata of most=20

rocks, causing their edges to project in many places above the surface; the=
ir exposure in other=20

instances, on the sides or tops of hills and mountains; or, in consequence =
of the intersection of=20

their strata, by roads, canals, and river-courses, or by the wearing of the=
 ocean; or their direct=20

perforation, by the shafts of mines; all=20


_
and called and known by the name of Hampshire." When Augusta and Frederick =
were authorized=20

in 1738, the western bounds of the Northern Neck Grant had not been surveye=
d. This was done in=20

1747, and the above Act changed the previous limits of Augusta so that the =
entire county would=20

not be a part of the proprietary.  The name of the next new county reflecte=
d current happenings.=20

For about six years, 1754-1760, the colony was actively participating in th=
e struggle to crush=20

French power in America. The Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in Am=
erica was, for a=20

time, John Campbell, fourth Earl of Loudoun. His conduct of the war was sev=
erely criticized, and=20

he was recalled in December 1757. He was, for almost two years, titular "Go=
vernor and Captain-

General of Virginia," though his deputy Lieutenant-Governor Robert Dinwiddi=
e performed all the=20

duties of the office. Loudoun, the new county named for the Earl, was forme=
d from Fairfax County=20

in 1757. It included "all that part thereof lying above Difficult Run which=
 falls into Potomac river and=20

by a line to be run from the head of the said run or straight course to the=
 mouth of Rocky run." The=20

part "thereof below the said run and course" retained its status as a disti=
nct county and the name=20

of Fairfax.  In 1759, the inhabitants of Prince William County complained o=
f many inconveniences=20

"by reason of the great extent thereof and their remote situation from the =
courthouse." Mindful that=20

justice be accessible to all, the Assembly enacted that Prince William be d=
ivided and "all that part=20

of the said county that lies above a line to be run from the head of Bull R=
un and along the top of=20

Bull run mountains to Chapman's mill, in Broad run thoroughfare, from thenc=
e by a direct line till it=20

intersects the nearest part of the line dividing Stafford and Prince Willia=
m Counties" be known as=20

Fauquier. This again honors an English official but in this case a very pop=
ular one, Francis=20

Fauquier, who, in 1758, succeeded Robert Dinwiddie as Lieutenant Governor o=
f Virginia. He=20

served the colony for nearly ten years, dying in Williamsburg on 3 March 17=
68 "after a tedious=20

illness which he bore with the greatest patience and fortitude." Among the =
eulogies in prose to his=20

memory, the following verse may be noted:      "If ever virtue lost a frien=
d sincere     If ever sorrow=20

claimed Virginia's tear     If ever death a noble conquest made     'Twas w=
hen Fauquier the debt of=20

nature paid."  With tobacco as the medium of exchange and as the most valua=
ble export, the=20

economic base was too small for the large superstructure erected on it. The=
 taxes, fees, and=20

commissions on exported tobacco were numerous and onerous, the net return t=
o the planter often=20

did not cover the goods he had ordered and his debt to his London agent inc=
reased. It was British=20

policy that her colonies should send her raw materials and buy from her man=
ufactured articles,=20

thus giving her merchants a double advantage and placing the colonists at d=
ouble disadvantage.=20

During the 1750's, the colony had been put to such great expense in prosecu=
ting the French and=20

Indian War that for the first time an issue of paper money was required. Ec=
onomic conditions grew=20

worse throughout the colony.   "WESTWARD-HO" TWENTY-SIX NEW COUNTIES, 1750-=
1770=20

The unceasing westward trek of settlers continued. In 1750-60, eight counti=
es were formed,=20

between 1760-1770, eighteen new divisions occurred, which evidences the gre=
at growth of=20

population.  Albemarle was the next county to be divided. In 1761, it was e=
nacted that the portion=20

"of the said county which lies on the south side of the Fluvanna river" [ol=
d name for the James=20

River above Richmond] "shall be one distinct county and called and known by=
 the name of=20

Buckingham." By the same legislation, "that other part of the said county w=
hich lies on the north=20

side of the Fluvanna river shall be divided from the confluence of Rockfish=
 river with the Fluvanna=20

by Rockfish river to the mouth of Green creek and thence a straight line to=
 the house of Thomas=20



Bell to the Blue mountains, and all that part which lies above Rockfish riv=
er and the lines=20

aforesaid" shall be called Amherst County. Amherst Parish at the same time =
was formed from=20

Saint Anne's Parish and made coterminous with the county of Amherst. Severa=
l years earlier,=20

Tillotson Parish had been formed from Saint Anne's to take care of the resi=
dents of Amherst who=20

lived on the south side of James River. It was now made coterminous with th=
e county of=20

Buckingham.  The name Buckingham is probably for the Duke of Buckingham. Am=
herst derives its=20

name from "the hero of Ticonderoga, Major-General Sir Jeffrey Amherst, the =
most successful as=20

well as the most popular of all the English Colonial Governors-General." He=
 was titular Governor-

General of Virginia 1759-1768 while Francis Fauquier performed the duties o=
f the office.  Four=20

years passed, and two more divisions were made in the western portion of Lu=
nenburg. The part of=20

Lunenburg comprised in the parish of Cornwall became Charlotte County and t=
he portion in the=20

parish of St. James became Mecklenburg.  These counties were named, as is t=
he city of=20

Charlottesville, after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who became Queen =
of England on her=20

marriage to King George III.  We next find in 1767 that Halifax has grown t=
o the point of division=20

and a new county, Pittsylvania, has been taken from its western portion. Pi=
ttsylvania lay on the=20

upper or western side "of a line to be run across the mouth of Strait Stone=
 creek on Staunton river=20

to the country line, near the mouth of the country line creek on Dan river.=
" At the same time,=20

Antrim, which was the parish for Halifax, was divided and the part lying in=
 Pittsylvania became=20

Camden. Pittsylvania honored "Sir William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, the celebr=
ated English=20

statesman" whose sympathy with them had endeared him to the colonists. A st=
atue of him in=20

Westmoreland county, Virginia and another in Charleston, South Carolina are=
 further expressions=20

of the affection felt for him.   BOTETOURT, 1770 HONORS A POPULAR COLONIAL=
=20

GOVERNOR  The next county was, in the main, a rearrangement of already sett=
led territory=20

bearing always in mind that easy access to justice was the purpose of every=
 division. The new=20

county, Botetourt, was formed from Augusta in 1770 and lay on the south sid=
e of a dividing "line=20

beginning at the Blue Ridge, running north fifty-five degrees west, to the =
confluence of Mary's=20

creek, or the south river, with the north branch of James River, thence up =
the same to the mouth=20

of Carr's creek, thence up the said creek to the mountain, thence north, fi=
fty-five degrees west as=20

far as the courts of the two counties shall extend it." The phrase to note =
in the above is: "as far as=20

the courts of the two counties shall extend it," in other words, there was =
no limit to the western=20

boundary. The name Botetourt was for Norborne Berkeley, Lord de Botetourt, =
Governor of Virginia=20

1768-1770. He died in Williamsburg in October 1770, lamented and beloved fo=
r his interest in the=20

colony and the College of William and Mary. The House of Burgesses voted a =
sum of money to=20

have a statue of him made in London to stand in the old Capitol building. T=
he statue still exists,=20

one of the most treasured possessions of the College of William and Mary, a=
nd adorns its campus.=20

FREDERICK SUBDIVIDED  Two years later, the county of Frederick had a divisi=
on on both its=20

eastern and northern ends. It was enacted by the Assembly that the territor=
y of Frederick be=20

divided into three distinct counties: "on the north by a line beginning in =
the line that divides the=20

counties of Frederick and Loudoun one mile and an half northward of the cor=
ner in Williams' gap=20

that at present divides the parishes of Frederick and Norborne thence westw=
ard with a line exactly=20

parallel to the line that now divides the said parishes of Frederick and No=
rborne till it intersects the=20

line of Hampshire county; thence with the Hampshire line to the corner divi=
ding the parishes of=20



Frederick and Beckford; thence with the lines dividing the said parishes of=
 Frederick and Beckford=20

east southeast to the south eastwardly bank of Cedar creek, thence binding =
on the same to its=20

confluence with the river Shenandoah; thence across the said river east to =
the easterly bank of the=20

same; thence down the said river and binding on the same to the mouth of Pa=
ssage creek; and=20

thence with a right line to the line of Culpeper, at the intersection of th=
e road leading through=20

Chester's gap; thence with the Culpeper, Fauquier, and Loudoun lines to the=
 beginning." This=20

area, so described, was to remain Frederick County. "All that part of the c=
ounty which lies between=20

the first mentioned line running from the said beginning in the line of Lou=
doun county and Potomac=20

river shall be ... known by the name of Berkeley county." The remainder of =
what had been=20

Frederick now became Dunmore County. There had been three parishes in Frede=
rick; of these=20

Frederick remained in the county, while Norborne appropriately became the p=
arish for Berkeley=20

and Beckford for Dunmore.  Berkeley County named for Norborne Berkeley, Lor=
d de Botetourt,=20

later became a part of West Virginia. It was further evidence of this gover=
nor's popularity,=20

Botetourt County having previously been named for him.   DUNMORE RENAMED SH=
ENANDOAH=20

Dunmore honored the new Governor, John Murray, Earl of Dunmore, who succeed=
ed Lord=20

Botetourt. His popularity was short lived, and his tyrannical acts, when he=
 attempted to keep the=20

colony loyal to the crown, so enraged the people that he was forced to take=
 refuge with his family=20

on a British warship. In 1777, still smarting over his behavior, the Assemb=
ly changed the name of=20

the county to Shenandoah for the beautiful river that flows through it; the=
 change to take effect=20

February 1, 1778.   FINCASTLE REACHES TO THE OHIO RIVER  In 1772, the count=
y of=20

Fincastle was formed from the western portion of Botetourt. It is an eviden=
ce of rapidly growing=20

settlements when for the first time mention is made of "inhabitants and set=
tlers on the waters of=20

Holston and New rivers." The territory of Fincastle was "within a line to r=
un up the east side of New=20

river to the mouth of Culberson's creek, thence a direct line to the Catawb=
a road where it crosses=20

the dividing ridge between the north fork of Roanoke and the waters of New =
river, thence with the=20

top of the ridge to the bent where it turns eastwardly, thence a south cour=
se crossing Little river to=20

the top of the Blue Ridge of mountains." The reason for the name Fincastle =
seems uncertain; one=20

version has it as being for George, Lord Fincastle, Lord Dunmore's son, and=
 the other that it was=20

for the town of Fincastle established in 1772 and so named for Lord Botetou=
rt's home in England.=20

VIRGINIA COUNTIES EXTENDED TO THE OHIO RIVER AND INCLUDE KENTUCKY  Fincastl=
e=20

County was an expansion of Augusta to the west but an expansion to the nort=
hwest had been in=20

progress since before 1754. In that year, Governor Dinwiddie ordered a fort=
 built on the present=20

site of Pittsburgh and issued a proclamation offering land in the area to t=
hose who would enlist as=20

soldiers for the French and Indian War. The French captured the fort and na=
med it Fort Duquesne.=20

This outpost of great strategic importance fell to the English in 1758 and =
was renamed Fort Pitt.=20

The area was under Virginia jurisdiction and called the district of West Au=
gusta being considered a=20

part of Augusta County. "County courts were held at Pittsburgh under Virgin=
ia jurisdiction and the=20

great section of country from the Alleghany mountains northwest to the Ohio=
 came to be called=20

West Augusta. It was represented under this name in the Conventions of 1775=
 and 1776. In=20

October 1776, the district of West Augusta was divided into the counties of=
 Ohio, Yohogania and=20

Monongalia. A portion of this territory, including Pittsburgh, was claimed =
by Pennsylvania and=20

there was much disorder and some bloodshed between the officers and adheren=
ts of the two=20



Colonies. In 1779, commissioners from Virginia and Pennsylvania finally set=
tled the line and=20

Pittsburgh and the adjoining area were surrendered to Pennsylvania." The ab=
ove is the concise=20

account, by the late W. G. Stanard, in an early volume of the _Virginia Mag=
azine of History and=20

Biography_, of an almost forgotten episode in western development. It expla=
ins why in the=20

Augusta County records in Staunton, Virginia are found deeds for land now i=
n Pennsylvania.  The=20

bounds of these three new counties, Ohio, Yohogania and Monongalia are set =
forth in detail in the=20

Act of Assembly creating them, but are not quoted here since they neither a=
djoin nor are a part of=20

the Commonwealth of Virginia now.   KENTUCKY A VIRGINIA COUNTY, 1776  The n=
ext division=20

of a county occurred in this same year 1776, and was further expansion towa=
rd the beckoning=20

west; this division was not to take effect until January first, 1777. Finca=
stle became extinct as a=20

county, its territory becoming Kentucky, Washington and Montgomery Counties=
. The Act of=20

Assembly recites that the part of Fincastle lying "to the south and westwar=
d of a line beginning on=20

the Ohio at the mouth of Great Sandy creek and running up the same and the =
main, or north-

easterly, branch thereof to the Great Laurel Ridge or Cumberland Mountain, =
thence south westerly=20

along the said mountain to the line of North Carolina shall be one distinct=
 county and called and=20

known by the name of Kentucky; and all that part of the said county of Finc=
astle included in the=20

lines beginning at the Cumberland Mountain where the line of Kentucky count=
y intersects the=20

North Carolina line, thence east along the said Carolina line to the top of=
 Iron mountain, thence=20

along the same easterly to the source of the south fork of Holstein river, =
thence northwardly along=20

the highest part of the high lands, ridges and mountains that divide the wa=
ters of the Tennessee=20

from those of the Great Kanawha, to the most easterly source of Clinch rive=
r, thence westwardly=20

along the top of the mountains that divide the waters of Clinch river from =
those of the Great=20

Kanawha and Sandy Creek to the line of Kentucky county thence along the sam=
e to the=20

beginning" shall be known "by the name of Washington; and all the residue o=
f the said county of=20

Fincastle shall be" known as Montgomery.  It is said that Washington County=
 is the first place or=20

area named for General Washington in the United States. It is also the firs=
t time the words=20

Kentucky and Tennessee occur in a county division and show the scope of wes=
tern settlements.=20

Montgomery County was named for General Richard Montgomery, a Revolutionary=
 officer, who=20

fell 31 December 1775, while trying unsuccessfully to scale the city walls =
and capture Quebec=20

from the English.  The next formation was a division of Pittsylvania County=
 in 1777, ten years after=20

its creation. The new county lay on the west side of "a line beginning at t=
he mouth of Blackwater=20

on Staunton river and running parallel with the line of Halifax county till=
 it strikes the country line."=20

The name Henry honored Patrick Henry, the famous orator of the Revolution a=
nd first Governor of=20

the Commonwealth of Virginia. He purchased a large acreage in Henry County =
but resided in=20

nearby Campbell County.  Also, in 1777, Albemarle was divided "by a line be=
ginning at the most=20

western point in the line of Louisa County and running thence directly to t=
he lower edge of Stott's=20

ferry on the Fluvanna river and that part which lies south eastward of the =
said line together with=20

the islands in the Fluvanna river adjacent thereto shall be called by the n=
ame of Fluvanna county."=20

The county was named for the river and the river was so called in honor of =
Queen Anne whose=20

name is borne by four other Virginia rivers. Fluvanna, used for most of the=
 eighteenth century, was=20

the title given the James River above its falls at Richmond. Tobacco and ot=
her merchandise was=20

taken in bateaux down this river to Richmond.  Both Henry and Fluvanna Coun=
ties had been=20



formed mostly because of natural increase in population rather than of any =
tide of immigration.=20

The creation of Powhatan County in 1777 was of the same type. This county e=
mbraced the portion=20

of Cumberland lying on the south side of James River and in Southam Parish,=
 which was the=20

eastern end of Cumberland and adjoined Chesterfield County. The name Powhat=
an honored the=20

celebrated Indian chieftain.  In 1778, the vast sprawling territory of Augu=
sta underwent changes.=20

One was an addition to Hampshire County of the territory on the north of "a=
 line beginning at the=20

north side of the North Mountain opposite to the upper end of Sweedland Hil=
l and running a direct=20

course so as to strike the mouth of Seneca creek on the north fork of the s=
outh branch of Potomac=20

river and the same course to be continued to the Allegheny mountain, thence=
 along the said=20

mountain" to the county line. "The residue of the county and parish of Augu=
sta" was divided by a=20

line beginning "at the South Mountain and running thence by Benjamin Yardle=
y's plantation so as=20

to strike the north river below James Byrd's house thence up the said river=
 to the mouth of Naked=20

creek, thence leaving the river a direct course so as to cross the said riv=
er at the mouth of=20

Cunningham's branch in the upper end of Silas Hart's land to the foot of No=
rth Mountain, thence=20

fifty-five degrees west to the Allegheny mountain and with the same to the =
line of Hampshire"; all=20

the portion north eastward of this line was to be called Rockingham. It is =
supposed the name of=20

this county honors the Marquis of Rockingham, Prime Minister of England in =
1765-66 when the=20

unpopular Stamp Act was repealed.  In the same Act of Assembly, 1778, by wh=
ich Rockingham=20

was created Greenbrier County, now in West Virginia, was formed from Montgo=
mery and=20

Botetourt Counties to the west of "a line beginning on the top of the ridge=
 which divides the=20

Eastern from the Western Waters, where the line between Augusta and Botetou=
rt crosses the=20

same, and running thence the same course continued north fifty-five degrees=
 west to the Ohio,=20

thence beginning at the said ridge at the said lines of Botetourt and Augus=
ta, running along the top=20

of the said ridge, passing the Sweet Springs to the top of Peter's mountain=
, thence along the said=20

mountain to the line of Montgomery county, thence along the same mountain t=
o the Kanawha or=20

New river, thence down the said river to the Ohio." Greenbrier County takes=
 its name from its=20

principal river. It is the anglicized version of the French word "ronce" fo=
r brier or bramble and=20

"verte" for green. The town Ronceverte, situated on the river, keeps the Fr=
ench word.  At the same=20

time Rockbridge County was formed from parts of Botetourt and Augusta. It w=
as bounded "by a=20

line beginning in the top of the Blue Ridge near Steele's mill and running =
thence north fifty-five=20

degrees west passing the said mill and crossing the North mountain to the t=
op and the mountain=20

dividing the waters of the Calf Pasture from the waters of the Cow Pasture =
and thence along the=20

said mountain crossing Panther's gap to the line that divides the counties =
of Augusta and=20

Botetourt." The remainder of Botetourt shall be divided "by a line to begin=
 at Audley Paul's and=20

running thence south fifty-five degrees east crossing James river, to the t=
op of the Blue Ridge,=20

thence along the same crossing James river, to the beginning of the aforesa=
id line dividing=20

Augusta county; then beginning again at the said Audley Paul's, and running=
 north fifty-five=20

degrees west till the said course shall intersect a line to be run south fo=
rty-five degrees west from=20

the place where the above line dividing Augusta terminated."  The enabling =
acts setting forth the=20

bounds for the counties when created have been quoted fully, both for the i=
nformation they contain=20

and for the comprehensive geographical knowledge they reveal. They show pai=
nstaking surveys=20

and study to achieve accuracy under the handicap of lack of roads and bridg=
es. In addition to=20



technical knowledge, the surveyor needed a sturdy physique to withstand the=
 daily hardships that=20

were part of his routine work.  Rockbridge, the name of the new county whos=
e bounds have been=20

described, commemorated the unique scenic wonder within its confines known =
as Natural Bridge.=20

This is a span of stone 215 feet high over Cedar Creek. Once a trail passed=
 over it and now a=20

modern highway. It has been known and visited since 1770.   WEST OF THE OHI=
O AND TO THE=20

MISSISSIPPI. ILLINOIS COUNTY FORMED  Illinois, the last county to be formed=
 in the decade=20

1770 to 1780 was an area on the western side of the Ohio River which had be=
en a part of Augusta=20

County. In the preamble to the Act creating this county, the Assembly noted=
 with satisfaction that=20

"by a successful expedition carried on by the Virginia militia on the weste=
rn side of the Ohio river=20

several of the British posts within the territory of this commonwealth in t=
he country adjacent to the=20

river Mississippi have been reduced." This, of course, was a reference to G=
eorge Rogers Clark=20

whose exploits secured the Mississippi Valley area for Virginia and the Uni=
ted States. Illinois=20

County was a part of the large territory given by Virginia to the nation in=
 1783.   KENTUCKY=20

COUNTY DIVIDED  The next event was the division of the unwieldy county of K=
entucky into three=20

parts; Jefferson, Fayette and Lincoln, with the towns of Louisville, Lexing=
ton and Harrodsburg for=20

their respective county seats. Jefferson County was so named to honor Thoma=
s Jefferson, and=20

was the first honor of this sort accorded him. Fayette was for the beloved =
ally, the Marquis de la=20

Fayette and Lincoln for General Benjamin Lincoln of the Revolution. When co=
mpelled to surrender=20

Charleston, South Carolina to the British, he had endured the humiliation o=
f giving up his sword to=20

Sir Henry Clinton. In return, when Yorktown was captured and Lord Cornwalli=
s required to yield his=20

sword, General Lincoln was awarded the distinction of receiving it. Cornwal=
lis, however, did not=20

appear in person, and it was his aide who handed the sword to General Linco=
ln. From these three=20

counties was formed the present Commonwealth of Kentucky.  A division of Br=
unswick in the=20

south eastern part of the state took place now and Greensville County came =
into being. This lay to=20

the east of a line beginning "two miles above Chapman's ford on Meherrin ri=
ver and running a due=20

south course to the boundary line between this state and North Carolina and=
 from the station=20

aforesaid by another line due north to Nottoway river." The name selected f=
or this county=20

commemorated General Nathanael Greene of the Revolution who marched into th=
is area on his=20

return from the Battle of Guilford Court House.  In 1782, occurred a divisi=
on of Bedford County.=20

The eastern end was cut from the whole and named for General William Campbe=
ll, the hero of=20

King's Mountain, one of the decisive battles of the Revolution. Campbell li=
es to the east of a line=20

beginning "at the mouth of Judy's creek on James river, thence to Thompson'=
s mill on Buffalo=20

creek, thence to the mouth of Back creek on Goose creek thence the same cou=
rse continued to=20

Staunton river." Staunton is the name given the Roanoke River as it passes =
through Bedford,=20

Campbell, Charlotte and Halifax Counties. In Mecklenburg, it resumes its or=
iginal name of=20

Roanoke and so continues into Albemarle Sound.  The next development was Ha=
rrison, taken=20

from Monongalia County. Neither is now a Virginia county, but it is mention=
ed since it honors=20

Benjamin Harrison, one of the seven Virginia Signers of the Declaration of =
Independence who also=20

completed in 1784, the year the county was formed, a three year term as Gov=
ernor of the=20

Commonwealth.  In the next year, a new county, Nelson, now in Kentucky, was=
 created. This, too,=20

honored a former Governor and Signer of the Declaration of Independence, Th=
omas Nelson. It=20

was his home in Yorktown that Lord Cornwallis used as his headquarters duri=
ng the siege and=20



battle.  In 1786, Franklin was formed out of "that part of the county of Be=
dford lying south of=20

Staunton river together with so much of the county of Henry lying north of =
a line to be run from the=20

head of Shooting creek to the west end of Turkeycock mountain, thence along=
 the top of the=20

mountain to intersect the dividing line between the counties of Henry and P=
ittsylvania, thence=20

along that line to the mouth of Blackwater river." The reason for this name=
 is obvious: all America=20

honored the achievements of Benjamin Franklin.   DEED OF CESSION. VIRGINIA =
GIVES THE=20

NORTHWEST TERRITORY  The tempo of western expansion had increased to such a=
n extent=20

that four counties were formed in 1786. One of these, Hardy, lies now in We=
st Virginia as does its=20

parent county of Hampshire. It might be well to explain now, even though ou=
t of chronological=20

sequence, the genesis of West Virginia. In May 1861 when Governor Letcher c=
alled out the=20

Virginia militia, many persons living beyond the Alleghanies throughout tha=
t section of Virginia=20

bordering on Ohio and Pennsylvania were not in sympathy with his action. Th=
e residents of some=20

forty counties held a convention and were almost unanimous in their desire =
to break away from=20

Virginia and form a new state. A constitution was framed which was ratified=
 by the people in May=20

1862. The following year, 1863, West Virginia became a state of the Union a=
nd at one blow,=20

Virginia lost a third of her territory. The loss of the rich coal fields an=
d other natural resources of=20

West Virginia impoverished the Old Dominion more severely and made "Reconst=
ruction Days"=20

longer and more difficult than they might otherwise have been.  Returning t=
o Hardy County, we=20

learn that it was named for Samuel Hardy formerly of Isle of Wight County "=
one of the number who=20

signed the Deed of Cession which transferred the Northwest Territory to the=
 General=20

Government."  Virginia's claim to territory was of long standing, her chart=
ers of 1609 and 1612=20

giving her dominion to the Pacific Ocean, but no exploration beyond the Mis=
sissippi had been=20

attempted. Her claim of dominion to the Mississippi, however, was of more s=
ubstantial character.=20

In 1778 with a picked force of 180 Virginia riflemen, George Rogers Clark c=
aptured the great=20

Northwest Territory from the English "in one of the most amazing exploits i=
n American history."=20

This territory Virginia organized as "the county of Illinois." "But for Cla=
rk's conquest the treaty of=20

1783 might well have fixed the nation's western boundary at the Alleghanies=
 instead of at the=20

Mississippi." Almost all the Ohio Valley and parts of Wisconsin and Michiga=
n were included in this=20

voluntary gift that Virginia made in 1783 to the weak confederated colonies=
. In 1785 Congress=20

passed a Land Ordinance providing for the sale of this land. "Thus this ces=
sion provided the infant=20

republic with its only sure source of revenue" since at that time "Congress=
 had neither the power=20

to impose nor the machinery to collect any taxes."  The other three countie=
s formed in 1786 lie=20

now in Kentucky which, in 1792, was "organized as a state out of Virginia t=
erritory with her=20

consent." These divisions are Mercer and Madison, created out of Lincoln, a=
nd Bourbon out of=20

Fayette. Mercer honored General Hugh Mercer of the Revolution; Madison, Jam=
es Madison, later=20

known as the "Father of the Constitution," and Bourbon, the French reigning=
 family, particularly=20

Louis XVI who had given aid in the Revolution.  The next county, Russell, w=
as taken from=20

Washington. Its bounds are: "all that part of the said county lying within =
a line to be run along the=20

Clinch mountain to the Carolina line; thence with that line to the Cumberla=
nd mountain, and the=20

extent of country between the Cumberland mountain, Clinch mountain and the =
line of Montgomery=20

county shall be one distinct county and called and known by the name of Rus=
sell." The name was=20

selected as a tribute to General William Russell "who distinguished himself=
 at the Battle of King's=20



mountain." Russell remains a Virginia county.  Five westward expansions now=
 occur in quick=20

succession. In 1787, from Harrison was formed Randolph County named for Edm=
und Randolph,=20

first Attorney General of the Commonwealth and a member of the Continental =
Congress. Both=20

Harrison and Randolph are in West Virginia. Pendleton, also now in West Vir=
ginia, was formed in=20

1788 from portions of Hardy, Augusta, and Rockingham counties. It is named =
for Edmund=20

Pendleton, President of the Virginia Convention of 1775.  The next year two=
 new Kentucky=20

counties were formed; Mason from Bourbon and Woodford from Fayette. The for=
mer took its name=20

from George Mason of "Gunston Hall," author of the Bill of Rights and the l=
atter from General=20

William Woodford, a native of Caroline County, Virginia who rendered distin=
guished service in the=20

Revolution and later moved to Kentucky.  At the same time, a new county des=
tined to be in West=20

Virginia was formed from Greenbrier and part of Montgomery counties and giv=
en the name of=20

Kanawha from the river.  The only one of the counties formed in 1789 that i=
s now in Virginia is=20

Nottoway. This was comprised of that part of Amelia County "lying south of =
a line to begin at a=20

place called Wells bridge on Namozene creek which divides the said county f=
rom the county of=20

Dinwiddie, thence running through the said county of Amelia so as to strike=
 the line of Prince=20

Edward county five miles west of a place called Ward's ford on Appomattox r=
iver." Nottoway is an=20

Indian word meaning "a snake, that is, an enemy." Nottoway River derives it=
s name from the=20

Indian tribe and the county honors both.   1790-1800 EXPANSION IN THE FIRST=
 DECADE=20

AFTER THE REVOLUTION  The next year a county was cut from Montgomery and na=
med Wythe.=20

It lies to the "south-west of a line beginning on the Henry line at the hea=
d of Big Reedy Island,=20

from thence to the waggon ford on Peck creek, thence to the clover bottom o=
n Blue Stone, thence=20

to the Kanawha county line." The name is for George Wythe, eminent jurist a=
nd a Signer of the=20

Declaration of Independence. Elected in 1779 to the Chair of Law and Police=
, recently established=20

at the College of William and Mary, he "became the first occupant of a chai=
r of law in America, and=20

the second in the English speaking world." The first chair of law establish=
ed in England was at=20

Oxford University, and Sir William Blackstone was the first professor.  The=
 year 1791 saw the=20

formation of three counties, all of them rearrangement of lines in establis=
hed communities rather=20

than expansion into new territory. The first was the division of Henry into=
 two counties: "all that=20

part of the said county reading the interior structure of the globe.  The o=
utlines of American=20

geology appear to be particularly grand, simple, and instructive; and a kno=
wledge of the important=20

facts, and general principles of this science, is of vast practical use, as=
 regards the interests of=20

agriculture, and the research for useful minerals. Geological and mineralog=
ical descriptions, and=20

maps of particular states and districts, are very much needed in the United=
 States; and to excite a=20

spirit to furnish them will form one leading object of this journal.  The s=
cience of natural philosophy,=20

with its powerful auxiliary, mathematics, and the science of chemistry, the=
 twin sister of natural=20

philosophy, are of incalculable importance to this country. A volume would =
not suffice to trace their=20

applications, and to enumerate the instances of their utility.  As one whic=
h may be allowed to=20

stand, _instar omnium_, we may mention the steam engine; that legitimate ch=
ild of physical and=20

chemical science--at once more powerful than the united force of the strong=
est and largest=20

animals, and more manageable than the smallest and gentlest; raising from t=
he bowels of the=20

earth the massy treasures of its mines, drawing up rivers from their channe=
ls, and pouring them, in=20

streams of life, into the bosom of cities; and, above all, propelling again=
st the currents, the winds,=20



and the waves of the ocean, those stupendous vessels, which combine speed w=
ith certainty, and=20

establish upon the bosom of the deep the luxuries and accommodations of the=
 land.  The=20

successful execution of this magnificent design was first witnessed upon th=
e waters of the=20

Hudson, but is now imitated in almost every civilized country; and it remai=
ns to be seen whether=20

they will emulate us by transporting, by the same means, and against the sa=
me obstacles, the=20

most formidable trains of artillery.  The mechanical inventions of this cou=
ntry are numerous; many=20

of them are ingenious, and some are highly important. In no way can a knowl=
edge of them be so=20

readily and extensively diffused as in a scientific journal. To this object=
, therefore, a part of our=20

labours (should there be a call for it,) will be devoted, and every necessa=
ry aid will be given by=20

plates and descriptions.  Science and art mutually assist each other; the a=
rts furnish facts and=20

materials to science, and science illuminates the path of the arts.  The sc=
ience of mathematics,=20

both pure and mixed, can never cease to be interesting and important to man=
, as long as the=20

relations of quantity shall exist, as long as ships shall traverse the ocea=
n, as long as man shall=20

measure the surface or heights of the earth on which he lives, or calculate=
 the distances and=20

examine the relations of the planets and stars; and as long as the _iron re=
ign of war_ shall=20

demand the discharge of projectiles, or the construction of complicated def=
ences.  In a word, the=20

whole circle of physical science is directly applicable to human wants, and=
 constantly holds out a=20

light to the practical arts; it thus polishes and benefits society, and eve=
ry where demonstrates both=20

supreme intelligence, and harmony and beneficence of design in THE CREATOR.=
     ART. I.=20

_Essay on Musical Temperament._[3]  By Professor FISHER, of Yale College.  =
 It is well known to=20

those who have attended to the subject of musical ratios, that a fixed scal=
e of eight degrees to the=20

octave, which shall render all its concords perfect, is impossible. It has =
been demonstrated by Dr.=20

Smith, from an investigation of all the positions which the major, the mino=
r, and the half-tone can=20

assume, that the most perfect scales possible, of which there are two equal=
ly so, differing only in=20

the position of the major and the minor tone above the key note, must have =
one Vth and one 3d=20

too flat, and consequently the supplementary 4th and VIth too sharp, by a c=
omma. In vocal music,=20

and in that of perfect instruments, this defect in the scale is not perceiv=
ed, because a small=20

change may be made in the key, whenever the occurrence of either of those n=
aturally imperfect=20

intervals renders such a change necessary to perfect harmony. But in instru=
ments with fixed=20

scales, such as the guitar, the piano-forte, and the organ, if we begin wit=
h tuning as many=20

concords as possible perfect, the resulting chords above-mentioned will be =
necessarily false in an=20

offensive degree. Hence it is an important problem in practical harmonics, =
to distribute these=20

imperfections in the scale among the different chords, in such a manner as =
to occasion the least=20

possible injury to harmony.  But this is not the only nor the principal dif=
ficulty which the tuner of=20

imperfect instruments has to encounter. In order that these instruments may=
 form a proper=20

accompaniment for the voice, and be used in conjunction with perfect instru=
ments, it is necessary=20

that music should be capable of being executed on them, in all the differen=
t keys in common use;=20

and especially that they should be capable of those occasional modulations =
which often occur in=20

the course of the same piece. Now only five additional sounds to the octave=
 are usually inserted=20

for this purpose, between those of the natural scale, which, of course, fur=
nish it with only three=20

sharps and two flats. Hence, when a greater number of flats or sharps is in=
troduced, the music can=20

be executed only by striking, in the former case, the sharp of the note nex=
t below; and, in the=20



latter, the flat of the note next above. But as the diatonic semitone is mo=
re than half the major, and=20

much more than half the minor tone, if the additional sounds in the common =
artificial scale be=20

made perfect for one of the above employments, they must be extremely harsh=
 for the other.=20

Hence arises the necessity of adjusting the position of these five inserted=
 sounds so that they may=20

make tolerable harmony, whichever way employed. A change in these will requ=
ire corresponding=20

changes in the position of the several degrees of the natural scale; so tha=
t it is highly probable that=20

the best scheme of temperament will leave no concord, either of the natural=
 or artificial scale,=20

absolutely perfect.  In adjusting the imperfections of the scale, the three=
 following considerations=20

have been usually taken into view.  I. One object to be aimed at is, to mak=
e the sum of the=20

temperaments of all the concords the least possible. Since experience teach=
es us that the=20

harshness of a given concord increases with its temperament, it is obvious =
that of two systems=20

which agree in other respects, the best is that in which the sum of the tem=
peraments is least.  II.=20

When other things are equal, the best adjustment of the imperfections of th=
e scale is that which=20

diminishes the harmoniousness of all the different concords proportionally.=
 The succession of a=20

worse to a better harmony, is justly regarded by several of the best writer=
s on this subject, as one=20

of the principal causes of offence to the ear, in instruments imperfectly t=
uned.  III. When different=20

chords of the same kind are of unequally frequent occurrence, there is an a=
dvantage, _c=C3=A6teris=20

paribus_, in giving the greatest temperament to that which occurs most seld=
om. This important=20

consideration has indeed been neglected by Dr. Smith, in the systems which =
he recommends,=20

both for his changeable and the common fixed scale; as it is, also, by the =
numerous advocates of=20

the system of equal semitones. But many authors on temperament, and most in=
strument-makers,=20

pay a vague regard to it. Their aim has been, although in a loose and conje=
ctural manner, to make=20

the prominent chords of the simplest keys the nearest to perfection, whilst=
 a greater temperament=20

is thrown upon those which occur only in the more complex keys. Thus Dr. Yo=
ung, in the Philos.=20

Trans. for 1800, recommends a scheme which increases the temperament of the=
 IIIds, on the key=20

note of the successive keys, as we modulate by fifths from C, nearly in ari=
thmetical progression.=20

Earl Stanhope assigns as a reason for the small temperament which is given =
to several of the IIIds=20

in his system, that they are on the tonic of the simpler keys. The irregula=
rities in Mr. Hawkes's=20

scheme may be traced to the same cause. And, with the instrument-makers, it=
 is a favourite=20

maxim to lay the wolf, as they term it, where it will be most seldom heard.=
  But if the above=20

consideration deserves any weight at all, it deserves to be accurately inve=
stigated. Not only ought=20

the relative frequency of different chords to be ascertained with the great=
est accuracy, of which the=20

nature of the subject is susceptible, but the degree of weight which this c=
onsideration ought to=20

have, when compared with the two others above-mentioned, should be determin=
ed: for it is plain=20

that neither of them ought to be ever left out of view.  Accordingly, the p=
rincipal design of the=20

following propositions will be to investigate the actual frequency of occur=
rence of different chords=20

in practice; and from this and the two other above-mentioned considerations=
 united, to deduce the=20

best system of temperament for a scale, containing any given number of soun=
ds to the octave,=20

and particularly for the common Douzeave, or scale of twelve degrees.   PRO=
POSITION I.    All=20

consonances may be regarded, without any sensible error in   practice, as e=
qually harmonious in=20

their kinds, when equally   tempered; and when unequally tempered, within c=
ertain limits, as=20

having their harmoniousness diminished in the direct ratio of   their tempe=
raments.  As different=20



consonances, when perfect, are not pleasing to the ear in an equal degree, =
some approaching=20

nearer to the nature of discords than others, so a set of tempered consonan=
ces, _c=C3=A6teris=20

paribus_, will be best constituted when their harmoniousness is diminished =
_proportionally_.=20

Suppose, for example, that the agreeable effects of the Vth, IIId, and 3d, =
when perfect, are as any=20

unequal numbers, _a_, _b_, and _c_; the best arrangement of a tempered scal=
e, other things=20

being equal, would be, not that in which the agreeable effect of the Vth wa=
s reduced to an=20

absolute level with that of the IIId, or 3d, but when they were so tempered=
 that their agreeable=20

effects on the ear might be expressed by (_m_/_n_)_a_, (_m_/_n_)_b_, and (_=
m_/_n_)_c_.  That=20

different consonances, in this sense, are equally harmonious in their kinds=
, when equally=20

tempered, or, at least, sufficiently so for every practical purpose, may be=
 illustrated in the following=20

manner:  [Illustration]  Let the lines AB, _ab_, represent the times of vib=
ration of two tempered=20

unisons. Whatever be the ratio of AB to _ab_, whether rational or irrationa=
l, it is obvious that the=20

successive vibrations will alternately recede from and approach each other,=
 till they very nearly=20

coincide; and, that during one of these periods, the longer vibration, AB, =
has gained _one_ of the=20

shorter. Let the points, A, B, &c. represent the middle of the successive t=
imes of vibration of the=20

lower; and _a_, _b_, &c. those of the higher of the tempered unisons. Let t=
he arc AGN..VA be a=20

part of a circle, representing one period of their pulses, and let the poin=
ts A, _a_, be the middle=20

points of the times of those vibrations which approach the nearest to a coi=
ncidence. It is obvious=20

that the dislocations _b_B, _c_C, &c. of the successive pulses, increase in=
 a ratio which is very=20

nearly that of their distances from A, or _a_. Now if the pulses exactly co=
incided, the unisons=20

would be perfect; and the same would be equally true, if the pulses of the =
one bisected, or divided=20

in any other constant ratio, those of the other; as clearly appears from ob=
servation. It is, therefore,=20

not the absolute magnitude, as asserted by Dr. Smith, but the _variableness=
_ of the successive=20

dislocations, B_b_, C_c_, &c. which renders the imperfect unisons discordan=
t; and the magnitude=20

of the successive increments of these dislocations is the measure of the de=
gree of discordance=20

heard in the unisons.  If now the time of vibration in each is doubled, AC,=
 _ac_, &c. will represent=20

the times of vibration of imperfect unisons an octave below, and the succes=
sive dislocations will be=20

C_c_, E_e_, &c. only half as frequent as before. But the unisons AE, _ae_, =
will be equally=20

harmonious with AB, _ab_; because, although the successive dislocations are=
 less frequent than=20

before, yet the coincidences C_c_, E_e_ of the corresponding perfect unison=
s are less frequent in=20

the same ratio.  Suppose, in the second place, that the time of vibration i=
s doubled, in only one of=20

the unisons, _ab_; and that the times become AB and _ac_, or those of imper=
fect octaves. These=20

will also be equally harmonious in their kind with the unisons AB, _ab_. Fo=
r, although the=20

dislocations C_c_, E_e_, &c. are but half as numerous as before, the coinci=
dences of the=20

corresponding perfect octaves will be but half as numerous. The dislocation=
s which remain are the=20

same as those of the imperfect unisons; and if some of the dislocations are=
 struck out, and the=20

increments of successive ones thus increased, no greater change is made in =
the nature of the=20

imperfect than of the perfect consonance.  If, thirdly, we omit two-thirds =
of the pulses of the lower=20

unison, retaining the octave _ac_ of the last case, we shall have AD, _ac_,=
 the times of vibration of=20

imperfect Vths, to which, and to all other concords, the same reasoning may=
 be applied as above.=20

It may be briefly exhibited thus; since the intermission of the coincidence=
s C_c_, E_e_ of the=20

perfect unisons, an octave below AB, does not render the Vth ADG _aceg_ les=
s perfect than the=20



unison A_c_  _ac_, each being perfect in its kind; so neither does the inte=
rmission of the=20

corresponding dislocations C_c_, E_e_, of the tempered unisons, in the impe=
rfect Vth, ADG,=20

_aceg_, render it less harmonious in its kind than the tempered unison AB, =
_ab_, from which it is=20

derived in exactly the same manner that the perfect Vth is derived from the=
 perfect unison.  The=20

consonances thus derived, as has been shown by Dr. Smith, will have the sam=
e periods, and=20

consequently the same beats, with the imperfect unisons. It is obvious, lik=
ewise, that they will all=20

be equally tempered. Let _m_ AB, and _n_ _ab_, be a general expression for =
the times of=20

vibration of any such consonance. The tempering ratio of an imperfect conso=
nance is always=20

found by dividing the ratio of the vibrations of the imperfect by that of t=
he corresponding perfect=20

consonance. But  (mAB)/(nab) =C3=B7 m/n =3D AB/ab;  which is evidently the =
tempering ratio of the=20

imperfect unisons.  Hence, so far as any reasoning, founded on the abstract=
 nature of coexisting=20

pulses can be relied on, (for, in a case of this kind, rigid demonstration =
can scarcely be expected,)=20

we are led to conclude that the harmoniousness of different consonances is =
proportionally=20

diminished when they are equally tempered.  The remaining part of the propo=
sition, viz. that=20

consonances differently tempered have their harmoniousness diminished, or t=
heir harshness=20

increased, in the direct ratio of their temperaments, will be evident, when=
 we consider that the=20

temperament of any consonance is the sole cause of its harshness, and that =
the effect ought to be=20

proportioned to its adequate cause. We may add, that the rapidity of the be=
ats, in a given=20

consonance, increases very nearly in the ratio of the temperament; and univ=
ersal experience=20

shows, that increasing the rapidity of the beats of the same consonance, in=
creases its harshness.=20

This is on the supposition that the consonance is not varied so much as to =
interfere with any other=20

whose ratio is equally simple.  _Cor._ We may hence infer, that in every sy=
stem of temperament=20

which preserves the octaves perfect, each consonance is equally harmonious,=
 in its kind, with its=20

complement to the octave, and its compounds with octaves. For the tempering=
 ratio of the=20

complement of any concord to the octave, is the same with that of the conco=
rd itself, differing only=20

in its sign, which does not sensibly affect the harmony or the rate of beat=
ing; while the tempering=20

ratio of the compounds with octaves is not only the same, but with the same=
 sign.   _Scholium 1._=20

There is no point in harmonics, concerning which theorists have been more d=
ivided in opinion than=20

in regard to the true measure of equal harmony, in consonances of different=
 kinds. Euler=20

maintains, that the more simple a consonance is, the less temperament it wi=
ll bear; and this seems=20

to have ever been the general opinion of practical musicians.[4] Dr. Smith,=
 on the contrary,=20

asserts, and has attempted to demonstrate, that the simpler will bear a muc=
h greater temperament=20

than the more complex consonances. The foregoing proposition has, at least,=
 the merit of taking=20

the middle ground between these discordant opinions. If admitted, it will g=
reatly simplify the whole=20

subject, and will reduce the labour of rendering all the concords in three =
octaves as equally=20

harmonious as possible, which occupies so large a portion of Dr. Smith's vo=
lume, to a single short=20

proposition. Dr. Smith's measure of equal harmony, viz. equal numbers of sh=
ort cycles in the=20

intervals between the successive beats, seems designed, not to render the d=
ifferent consonances=20

proportionally harmonious, but to reduce the simpler to an absolute level, =
in point of=20

agreeableness, with the more complex; which, as has been shown, is not the =
object to be aimed at=20

in adjusting their comparative temperaments. But, in truth, his measure is =
far more favourable to=20

the complex consonances than equal harmony, even in this sense, would requi=
re; and, in a great=20



number of instances, leads to the grossest absurdities. Two consonances, ac=
cording to him, are=20

equally harmonious, when their temperaments are inversely as the products o=
f the least numbers=20

expressing their perfect ratio. If so, the VIII + 3d, whose ratio is 5/12, =
when tempered 1/20 of a=20

comma, and the unison, whose ratio is 1/1, when tempered 3 commas, are equa=
lly harmonious.=20

But all who have the least experience in tempered consonances will pronounc=
e, at once, that the=20

former could scarcely be distinguished by the nicest ear from the correspon=
ding perfect concord,=20

while the latter would be a most offensive discord. One instance more shall=
 suffice. The=20

temperaments to render the VIII + Vth, and the VIII + 6th equally harmoniou=
s, are laid down in his=20

tables to be as 80 : 3. We will now suppose an instrument perfectly tuned i=
n Dr. Smith's manner,=20

and furnished with all the additional sounds which constitute his changeabl=
e scale. In this system,=20

the IIIds, and consequently the VIII + 6ths, are tempered 1/9 of a comma; w=
hich, so far from being=20

offensive, will be positively agreeable to the ear. This cannot be doubted =
by those who admit that=20

the VIII + 6ths in the common imperfect scales, when tempered at a medium n=
early seven times=20

as much, make tolerable harmony. Yet, according to the theory which we are =
opposing, the VIII +=20

Vth will be equally harmonious when tempered nearly a minor semitone. Now l=
et any one, even=20

with the common instruments, whenever an VIII + Vth occurs, strike the semi=
tone next above or=20

below: for example, instead of playing C, _g_, let him play C, _g_; instead=
 of A, _e_, let him play=20

A, _e_, &c. and compare the harmony of these with that of the VIII + 6ths, =
if he wants any farther=20

evidence that Dr. Smith's measure of equal harmony is without foundation.  =
It may be thought, that=20

even the measure of equal harmony laid down in the proposition, is more fav=
ourable to the=20

complex consonances than the conclusions of experience will warrant. But wh=
en it is asserted by=20

practical musicians, that the octave will bear less tempering than the Vth,=
 the Vth less than the IIId,=20

&c., they doubtless intend to estimate the temperament by the rate of beati=
ng, and to imply, that=20

when different consonances to the same base are made to beat equally fast, =
the simpler are more=20

offensive than the more complex consonances. This is entirely consistent wi=
th the proposition; for=20

when equally tempered, the more complex consonances will beat more rapidly =
than the more=20

simple; if on the same base, very nearly in the ratio of their major terms.=
 (Smith's Har. Prop. XI.=20

Cor. 4.) If, for example, an octave, a Vth, and a IIId on the same base wer=
e made to beat with a=20

rapidity which is as the numbers 2, 3, and 5, no unprejudiced ear would pro=
bably pronounce the=20

octave less harmonious in its kind than the IIId.  To those, on the other h=
and, who may incline to a=20

measure of equal harmony between that laid down in the proposition and that=
 of Dr. Smith, on=20

account of the rapidity of the beats of the more complex consonances, it ma=
ybe sufficient to reply,=20

that if the beats of a more complex consonance are more rapid than those of=
 a simpler one, when=20

both are equally tempered, those of the latter, c=C3=A6teris paribus, are m=
ore _distinct_. It is the=20

distinctness of the undulations, in tempered consonances, which is one of t=
he principal causes of=20

offence to the ear.   _Scholium 2._  It will be proper to explain, in this =
place, the notation of musical=20

intervals, which will be adopted in the following pages. It is well known t=
hat musical intervals are=20

as the logarithms of their corresponding ratios. If, therefore, the octave =
be represented by .30103,=20

the log. of 2, the value of the Vth will be expressed by .17509; that of th=
e major tone by .05115;=20

that of the comma by .00540, &c. But in order to avoid the prefixed ciphers=
, in calculations where=20

so small intervals as the temperaments of different concords are concerned,=
 we will multiply each=20

of these values by 100,000, which will give a set of integral values having=
 the same ratio. The=20



octave will now become 30103, the comma 540, &c.; and, in general, when tem=
peraments are=20

hereafter expressed by numbers, they are to be considered as so many 540ths=
 of a comma. Had=20

more logarithmic places been taken, the intervals would have been expressed=
 with greater=20

accuracy; but it was supposed that the additional accuracy would not compen=
sate for the=20

increased labour of computation which it would occasion. This notation has =
been adopted by Dr.=20

Robinson, in the article Temperament, (Encyc. Brit. Supplement;) and for ev=
ery practical purpose,=20

is as much superior to that proposed by Mr. Farey, in parts of the Schisma,=
 lesser fraction and=20

minute,[5] as all decimal measures necessarily are, to those which consist =
of different=20

denominations.   PROPOSITION II.    In adjusting the imperfections of the s=
cale, so as to render=20

all the consonances as equally harmonious as possible, only the   simple co=
nsonances, such as=20

the Vth, IIId, and 3d, with their   complements to and compounds with the o=
ctave, can be=20

regarded.  It has been generally assigned as the reason for neglecting the =
consonances, usually=20

termed discords, in ascertaining the best scheme of temperament, that they =
are of less frequent=20

occurrence than the concords. This, however, if it were the only reason, wo=
uld lead us, not to=20

neglect them entirely, but merely to give them a less degree of influence t=
han the concords, in=20

proportion as they are less used.  A consideration which seems not to have =
been often noticed,=20

renders it impossible to pay them any regard in harmonical computations. Al=
l such computations=20

must proceed on the supposition that within the limits to which the tempera=
ments of the different=20

consonances extend, they become harsher as their temperaments are increased=
. It is evident that=20

any consonance may be tempered so much as to become better by having its te=
mperament=20

increased, in consequence of its approaching as near to some other perfect =
ratio, the terms of=20

which are equally small; or perhaps much nearer some perfect ratio whose te=
rms are not=20

proportionally larger. For example, after we have sharpened the Vth more th=
an 3 commas, it=20

becomes more harmonious, as approaching much nearer to the perfect ratio 5/=
6. In this, however,=20

and the other concords, the value of the nearest perfect ratios in small nu=
mbers, varies so much=20

from the ratios of these concords, and the consequent limits within which t=
he last part of Prop. I.=20

holds true, are so wide that there is no hazard in making it a basis of cal=
culation. And if there be a=20

few exceptions to this, in some systems, in which the temperaments of a few=
 of the concords=20

become so large as to approach nearer to some other perfect ratio, whose te=
rms are nearly as=20

small as those of the perfect concord, although they might become more harm=
onious, by having=20

their temperament increased, yet their effect in _melody_ would be still mo=
re impaired; so that the=20

concords may all be considered as subjected to the same rule of calculation=
.  But the limits within=20

which the second part of Prop. I. holds true, with regard to the more compl=
ex consonances, are=20

much more limited. We cannot, for instance, sharpen the 7th, whose ratio is=
 9 : 16 more than =C2=BD a=20

comma, without rendering it more harmonious, as approaching nearer another =
perfect ratio which=20

is simpler; that of 5 : 9. Yet the difference between these two 7ths is so =
trifling that they have never=20

received distinct names; and, indeed, their effect on the ear in melody wou=
ld not be sensibly=20

different.  Again, the 5th, whose perfect ratio has been generally laid dow=
n as 45 : 64, but which is=20

in reality 25 : 36,[6] cannot be sharpened more than  of a comma, before it=
 becomes more=20

harmonious by having its temperament increased, as approaching nearer the s=
impler ratio 7 : 10.=20

At the same time, the effect of this interval in melody would not be sensib=
ly varied. The limits,=20

within which the harmoniousness of the IVth is inversely as its temperament=
, are still narrower.=20



Hence it appears that no inference can be drawn from the temperaments of su=
ch consonances as=20

the 7th, 5th, IVth, &c. respecting their real harmoniousness. The other per=
fect ratios which have=20

nearly the same value with those of these chords, and which are in equally =
simple terms, are so=20

numerous that by increasing their temperament they alternately become more =
and less=20

harmonious; and in a manner so irregular, that to attempt to subject them t=
o calculation, with the=20

concords, would be in vain. Even when unaltered, they may be considered eit=
her as greater=20

temperaments of more simple, or less temperaments of more complex ratios. S=
uppose the 5th, for=20

example, to be flattened  of a comma: shall it be considered as deriving it=
s character from the=20

perfect ratio 25 : 36, and be regarded as flattened 108; or shall it be ref=
erred to the perfect ratio 7 :=20

10, and considered as sharpened 239? No one can tell.--On the whole, it is =
manifest that no=20

consonances more complex than those included in the proposition, can be reg=
arded in adjusting=20

the temperaments of the scale.   PROPOSITION III.    The best scale of soun=
ds, which renders the=20

harmony of all the   concords as nearly equal as possible, is that in which=
 the Vths   are flattened=20

2/7, and the IIIds and 3ds, each 1/7 of a comma.  The octave must be kept p=
erfect, for reasons=20

which have satisfied all theoretical and practical harmonists, how widely s=
oever their opinions=20

have differed in other respects. Admitting equal temperament to be the meas=
ure of equal=20

harmony, the complements of the Vth, IIId, and 3d, to the octave, and their=
 compounds with=20

octaves will be equally harmonious in their kinds with these concords respe=
ctively; according to=20

the corollary of Prop I.  Hence we have only to find those temperaments of =
the Vths, IIIds, and=20

3ds, in the compass of one octave, which will render them all, as nearly as=
 possible, equally=20

harmonious. The temperaments of the different concords of the same name oug=
ht evidently to be=20

rendered equal; since, otherwise, their harmony cannot be equal. This can b=
e effected only by=20

rendering the major and minor tones equal, and preserving the equality of t=
he two semitones. If=20

this is done, the temperament of all the IIIds will be equal, since they wi=
ll each be the sum of two=20

equal tones. For a similar reason the 3ds, and consequently the Vths, forme=
d by the addition of=20

IIIds, and 3ds, will be equally tempered.  [Illustration:      x - c     x =
   (3c - 5x)/2   x - c     x    x - c=20

(3c - 5x)/2   |--------|-----|-------------|--------|-----|--------|-------=
------|   C        D     E             F        G     A=20

B             c ]  In order to reduce the octave to five equal and variable=
 tones, and two equal and=20

variable semitones, we will suppose the intervals of the untempered octave =
to be represented by=20

the parts CD, DE, &c. of the line C_c_. Denoting the comma by _c_, we will =
suppose the tone DE,=20

which is naturally minor, to be increased by any variable quantity, _x_; th=
en, by the foregoing=20

observations, the other minor tone, GA, must be increased by the same quant=
ity. As the major=20

tones must be rendered equal to the minor, their increment will be _x_ - _c=
_. As the octave is to be=20

perfect, the variation of the two semitones must be the same with that of t=
he five tones, with the=20

contrary sign; and as they are to be equally varied, the decrement of each =
will be (5_x_ - 3_c_)/2;=20

or what amounts to the same thing, the increment of each will be (3_c_ - 5_=
x_)/2.  The several=20

concords of the same name in this octave are now affected with equal and va=
riable temperaments.=20

The common increment of the IIIds will be 2_x_ - _c_; that of the 3ds =C2=
=BD =C2=B7 (_c_ - 3_x_); and=20

consequently that of the Vths =C2=BD =C2=B7 (_x_ - _c_).  In adjusting thes=
e variable temperaments, so as to=20

render the harmony of the concords of _different_ kinds, as nearly equal as=
 possible, we=20

immediately discover that, as the Vth is composed of the IIId and 3d, the t=
emperaments of the=20

three cannot all be equal. When the temperaments of the IIId and 3d have th=
e same sign, that of=20



the Vths must be equal to their sum; and, when they have contrary signs, to=
 their difference.=20

Hence the temperament of one of these three concords is necessarily equal t=
o the sum of that of=20

the other two. This being fixed, the temperaments, and consequently, (by Pr=
op. I.) the discordance=20

of the different consonances is the most equably divided possible, when the=
 two smaller=20

temperaments, whose sum is equal to the greater, are made equal to each oth=
er. The problem=20

contains three cases.  1. When the temperaments of the IIId and 3d have the=
 same sign, they=20

ought to be equal to each other. Making  2x - c =3D =C2=BD =C2=B7 (c - 3x),=
 we obtain x =3D 3/7 c,  which,=20

substituted in the general expressions for the temperaments of the Vth, III=
d, and 3d, makes their=20

increments equal to -2/7 _c_, -1/7 _c_, -1/7 _c_, respectively.  2. Let the=
 temperaments of the IIId=20

and 3d have contrary signs: and first, let that of the IIIds be the greater=

above where it crosses=20

Town creek, a branch of Smith's river, thence a parallel line with Pittsylv=
ania line to the country=20

line shall be one distinct county and called and known by the name of Patri=
ck." The name, of=20

course, was the given name of the great orator, and since Henry County bore=
 his surname, the=20

new division took his given name. It is a county of beautiful mountains wit=
h panoramic views. The=20

Fairy Stone State Park is within its borders. On Fairy Stone Mountain and i=
n the streams at its=20

base are found tiny stones shaped like crosses. The story is that the gentl=
e fairy folk when they=20

heard of our Lord's Crucifixion wept profusely and their tears turned to st=
one crosses as they fell, a=20

lasting memorial of their grief.  The next county, formed in 1791, was Bath=
. Its bounds are thus=20

described: "All those parts of the counties of Augusta, Botetourt and Green=
brier within the=20

following bounds, to wit: beginning at the west corner of Pendleton county,=
 thence to the top of the=20

ridge dividing the headwaters of the South branch from those of Jackson's r=
iver, thence a straight=20

line to the lower end of John Redman's plantation on the Cow-pasture river,=
 thence to the top of=20

the ridge that divides the waters of the Cow-pasture from those of the Calf=
-pasture thence along=20

the same as far as the ridge that divides Hamilton's creek from Mill creek,=
 thence to the Mill=20

mountain, and with the same to the north corner of the line of Rockbridge c=
ounty, thence along the=20

said mountain crossing the line of Botetourt county to the ridge that divid=
es the waters of Pad's=20

creek from those of Simpson's creek, thence along the said ridge to the Cow=
-pasture river, thence=20

crossing the said river a direct course and crossing Jackson's river at the=
 mouth of Dunlap's creek,=20

thence up the same as far as the narrows above the plantation of David Tate=
, Senr., so as to leave=20

the inhabitants of the said creek in Botetourt county, thence a direct cour=
se to the top of the=20

Allegany mountain where the road from the Warm Springs to Greenbrier court =
house crosses the=20

said mountain, thence along the top of the said mountain opposite the headw=
aters of Anthony's=20

creek, thence a direct course crossing Greenbrier river to the end of the D=
roop mountain, thence=20

up the same to the great Greenbrier mountain thence along the said mountain=
 to the line of=20

Randolph county thence with the same along the said mountain dividing the w=
aters of Monongalia=20

and Cheat from those of Greenbrier river, and thence to its beginning shall=
 form one distinct=20

county."  The above is quoted in full since the names used are still in use=
, and it is possible to=20

judge from them the extent of the county. Warm Springs is still in Bath, bu=
t Narrows is in Giles=20

County, and Alleghany County lies between Bath and Giles.  The name Bath de=
rives from the=20

medical springs within its boundaries, which for many years during the summ=
er months were=20

visited by persons from as far south as Louisiana. Families drove up in the=
ir carriages and stayed=20

for months to enjoy the curative effects of the waters and bracing mountain=
 air.  The third county=20

formed in 1791 was Mathews which was taken from Gloucester. It lies "to the=
 eastward of a line to=20

begin at the mouth of North river, thence up the meanders thereof to the mi=
ll, thence up the=20

eastern branch of the millpond to the head of Muddy creek thence down the s=
aid creek to=20

Piankatank river." The name is said to be in honor of a Major Thomas Mathew=
s of the Revolution=20

who afterwards was prominent in the legislature representing the Borough of=
 Norfolk in the House=20

of Delegates from 1785 to 1791.  In 1793, there were also three counties fo=
rmed. One of these,=20

Grayson, was taken from Wythe as follows: "Beginning in the Washington line=
 where it joins the=20

Iron Mountain, thence along the said mountain to a spur of the same that fo=
rms Ewing mountain,=20

keeping the ridge that divides the waters of Cripple and Bush creeks to the=
 top of the said=20



mountain, thence a straight course to the Popular Camp mountain by Rose's m=
ill thence to the=20

mouth of Greasy creek thence a straight course to the Montgomery line." Gra=
yson took its name=20

from Colonel William Grayson, an officer in the Revolution, member of the C=
ontinental Congress=20

and one of the first two senators elected from Virginia after the adoption =
of the Constitution to=20

serve in the Congress of the United States. Unfortunately his tenure of off=
ice was short; he died 12=20

March 1790.  Also in 1793, Russell County was divided and all that part "wh=
ich lies westwardly of=20

a line beginning on the top of Clinch mountain, one mile eastwardly of big =
Maukason gap, thence=20

a direct course to the mouth of Stock creek thence up the same to Powell's =
mountain, thence due=20

north to the Kentucky boundary shall form one distinct county and be called=
 and known by the=20

name of Lee." The name honored General Henry Lee who was Governor of Virgin=
ia 1791-1794.=20

He is more often called "Light Horse Harry Lee" from the fact that he comma=
nded, during the=20

Revolution, light horse cavalry. He was the father of General Robert E. Lee=
. Lee is the county=20

farthest to the west and adjoins Tennessee and Kentucky.  Also in 1793, the=
 county of Madison=20

was formed from Culpeper. Its bounds were within a line "Beginning at the m=
outh of Robinson=20

river thence up the to be double of the latter, in order that the temperame=
nt of the Vths and and=20

3ds may be equal. Hence we have  2x - c =3D - 2 =C2=B7 =C2=BD =C2=B7 (c - 3=
x); whence x is found =3D 0;  and by=20

substitution as before, the required temperament of the IIId =3D - _c_; of =
the Vth - =C2=BD_c_, and of the=20

3d =C2=BD_c_.  3. Let the temperaments of the IIId and 3d have contrary sig=
ns, as before; and let that of=20

the 3d be the greater.  Making =C2=BD =C2=B7 (c - 3x) =3D -2 =C2=B7 (2x - c=
), we obtain x =3D 3/5 c;  which gives, by=20

substitution, the temperaments of the 3d, Vth, and IIId - 2/5 _c_, - 1/5 _c=
_, and 1/5 _c_,=20

respectively.  Each of these results makes the harmony of all the consonanc=
es as nearly equal as=20

possible; but as the sum of the temperaments in the first case is much the =
least, it follows that the=20

temperaments stated in the proposition constitute the best scheme of interv=
als for the natural=20

scale, in which the harmony of all the different consonances is rendered as=
 nearly equal as=20

possible.  _Cor. 1._ In the same manner it may be shown that these temperam=
ents are the best,=20

among those which approach as nearly as possible to equal harmony, for the =
_artificial_ scale;=20

provided that it is furnished with distinct sounds for all the sharps and f=
lats in common use. By=20

inserting a sound between F and G, making the interval FG equal to either o=
f the semitones found=20

above, the intervals, reckoned from G as a key note, will be exactly the sa=
me in respect to their=20

temperaments, as the corresponding ones reckoned from C. The same thing hol=
ds, whatever be=20

the number of flats and sharps. It is supposed, however, that the flat of a=
 note is never used for the=20

sharp of that next below, or the contrary; and hence this scheme of tempera=
ment would only be=20

adapted to an instrument, furnished with all the degrees of the enharmonic =
scale; or, at least, with=20

as many as are in common use.  _Cor. 2._ This scale will differ but little =
in practice from the one=20

deduced, with so much labour, by Dr. Smith, from his criterion of equal har=
mony; which flattens the=20

Vths 5/18, the IIIds 1/9, and the 3ds 1/6 of a comma. The several differenc=
es are only 1/126, 2/63,=20

and 1/42 of a comma. Hence, as his measure of equal harmony differs so wide=
ly from that of=20

Proposition I. we may infer that the consideration of equalizing the harmon=
y of the concords of=20

different names can have very little practical influence on the temperament=
s of the scale. Should it,=20

therefore, be maintained that the criterion laid down in Prop. I. is not ma=
thematically accurate; yet,=20

as it must be allowed, in the most unfavourable view, to correspond far bet=
ter with the decisions of=20

experience than that of Doctor Smith, the chance is, that, at the lowest es=
timate, the=20



temperaments deduced from it approach much more nearly to correctness. Henc=
e it is manifest=20

that equal temperament may be made, _without any sensible error in practice=
_, the criterion of=20

equal harmony.   _Scholium 3._  Although the foregoing would be the best di=
vision of the musical=20

scale, if our sole object were to render the harmony of its concords as nea=
rly equal as possible,=20

yet the two other considerations, stated at the beginning of the essay, mus=
t by no means be=20

neglected, as has been done by Dr. Smith. It seems to be universally admitt=
ed, that the sum of the=20

temperaments may be increased to a certain extent, in order to equalize the=
 harmony of the=20

concords; otherwise the natural scale of major and minor tones, which makes=
 the sum of the=20

temperaments of the Vths, IIIds, and 3ds but 2 commas, ought to be left una=
ltered. Yet how far=20

this principle ought to be carried, may be a matter of doubt. If we make th=
e IIIds perfect, and=20

flatten the Vths and 3ds each =C2=BC _c_, according to the old system of me=
an tones, we shall have the=20

smallest aggregate of temperaments which admits of the different concords o=
f the same name=20

being rendered equally imperfect; but this amounts to 2=C2=BD commas. Thus =
far, however, it seems=20

evidently proper to proceed. If we go still farther, and endeavour to equal=
ize the harmony of the=20

concords of _different_ names, it may be questioned whether nearly as much =
is not lost as gained;=20

for the aggregate temperaments are increased, in Dr. Smith's scale, to 2 _c=
_, and in that of the=20

above proposition to 2-5/7 _c_. The system of mean tones, although more une=
qual in its harmony=20

when but two notes are struck at once, yet when the chords are played full,=
 as they generally are=20

on the organ, never offends the ear by a transition from a better to a wors=
e harmony. For every=20

_triad_ is equally harmonious; being composed of a perfect IIId, and a Vth =
and 3d, tempered each=20

=C2=BC _c_, or of their complements to, or compounds with octaves, which, i=
n their kinds, are equally=20

harmonious.  Again, if different chords, in practice, vary in the frequency=
 of their occurrence, this=20

will be a sufficient reason for deviating from the system of equal temperam=
ent. Suppose, for=20

example, that a given sum of temperament is to be divided between two Vths,=
 one of which occurs=20

in playing ten times as often as the other: there can be no doubt that the =
greater part of the=20

temperament ought to be thrown upon the latter. Hence it becomes an importa=
nt problem to=20

ascertain, with some degree of precision, the relative frequency with which=
 different consonances=20

occur in practice. Before proceeding to a direct investigation of this prob=
lem, it may be observed,=20

" One may wonder=20

that the name Madison was used again, but at this date the earlier Madison =
County lay in=20

Kentucky. When in 1792 Kentucky achieved statehood, it was composed of nine=
 counties formerly=20

in Virginia; namely: Fayette, Lincoln, Jefferson, Madison, Mercer, Nelson, =
Bourbon, Mason and=20

Woodford.  Four years after Madison County, Virginia was formed, Brooke was=
 cut from Ohio=20

County. This name was for Robert Brooke, Governor of Virginia 1794 to 1796.=
 He was a grandson=20

of the Robert Brooke who, in 1716, accompanied Governor Spotswood on the fa=
mous expedition=20

across the Blue Ridge Mountains. Both Brooke and Ohio are now in West Virgi=
nia.  In 1798, Wood=20

was established from Harrison County. It is named for James Wood, Governor =
of Virginia 1796 to=20

1799, and son of Colonel James Wood, an early settler in the Valley of Virg=
inia, and founder of the=20

city of Winchester. Wood and Harrison are also West Virginia counties.  The=
 next county created,=20

also destined to lie in West Virginia, was Monroe. This was formed from Gre=
enbrier County and=20

named to honor James Monroe. Born, like General Washington, in Westmoreland=
 County, he had=20

a long political career culminating in the Presidency of the United States.=
 The creed he=20

expounded, called the "Monroe Doctrine", is still followed by our governmen=

CENTURY BRINGS SIX NEW COUNTIES 1800-1810  As the new century, 1800, came i=
n,=20

Tazewell was formed from Wythe and Russell counties. Its bounds were all th=
at part of the=20

aforesaid counties "beginning on the Kanawha line and running with the line=
 which divides a given=20

key, it cannot have escaped the most superficial observer, that the most fr=
equent combination of=20

sounds is the common chord on the tonic; that the next after this is that o=
n the dominant, and the=20

third, that on the subdominant. Perhaps scarcely a piece of music can be fo=
und, in which this=20

order of frequency does not hold true. It is equally true that some signatu=
res occur oftener than=20

others. That of one sharp will be found to be more used, in the major mode,=
 than any other; and, in=20

general, the more simple keys will be found of more frequent occurrence tha=
n those which have=20

more flats or sharps. These differences are not the result of accident. The=
 tonic, dominant, and=20

subdominant, are obviously the most prominent notes in the scale, and must =
always be the=20

fundamental bases of more chords than either of the others; while the great=
er ease of playing on=20

the simpler keys will always be a reason with composers for setting a large=
r part of their music on=20

these, than on the more difficult keys. It is observable, that the greater =
part of musical=20

compositions, whether of the major or minor mode, is reducible to two kinds=
: that in which the=20

base chiefly moves between the tonic and its octave, and that in which the =
base moves between=20

the dominant and subdominant of the key. The former class, in the major mod=
e, are almost=20

universally set on the key of one sharp; the latter, generally on the natur=
al key, or that of two=20

sharps. In the minor mode, the former class have usually the signature of t=
wo flats, or the natural=20

key; the latter, that of one flat. Hence the three former keys will compris=
e the greater part of the=20

music in the major mode, and the three latter, of that in the minor mode, i=
n every promiscuous=20

collection. But if we were even to suppose each of the chords in the same k=
ey, and each of the=20

signatures, of equally frequent occurrence, some chords would occur much of=
tener, as forming an=20

essential part of=20
