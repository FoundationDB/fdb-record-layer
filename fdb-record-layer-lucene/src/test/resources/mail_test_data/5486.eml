see that tall tower with balls and flags on it; and it is from this point t=
hat all the movements of vessels in the canal are controlled. But I think w=
e had better land, and see it for ourselves."  The company went on shore, a=
nd proceeded to promenade the environs. One of the first things that attrac=
ted their attention was a colossal bronze _
you or me or anybody outside of the inner circle is a mighty poor foundatio=
n upon which to build=20

any idea of what's going on in the back of his head. No--hold on; don't get=
 mad. What I'm trying to=20

tell you is what everybody in the sage-brush hills--save and excepting your=
self--knows like a book,=20

and that is that the big boss's moves are all made strictly in the dark. He=
 doesn't let his own right=20

hand know what the left is doing. That's the secret of his absolutely Czari=
sh power, I think."  The=20

shriek of a distant locomotive whistle floated in through the open window a=
t Blount's back and he=20

got up stiffly.  "That's my train coming," he said. And then: "Tell me plai=
nly, Dick: you brought me=20

up here to throw a final brick--a bigger one than you have yet thrown--and =
I know it. What did Mr.=20

McVickar tell you to-day that will make my job harder than I am already fin=
ding it?"  Gantry turned=20

his head, refusing to meet the straightforward gaze of the questioner.  "Yo=
u intimated this morning=20

that you would go at it lawyer-fashion, Evan," he said; "which means, I sup=
pose, that you would=20

get the evidence on us. You can do it; the Lord knows, there's plenty of it=
 to be had. But when you=20

pull out one set of props the whole thing will come down. We haven't any of=
 us been careful=20

enough about what we put in writing--_not even your father_."  Blount stagg=
ered as if the words=20

had been a blow.  "You're trying to tell me that my father would be involve=
d in the disclosures you=20

fellows might drive me to make?" he demanded, and his voice was husky.  Gan=
try was still looking=20

away. "There always has to be an intermediary--you know that. We can't do b=
usiness direct with=20

these--with the people who have something to sell. You can draw your own in=
ferences, Evan. I=20

didn't send Hathaway to you; I sent him to your father."  The train was thu=
ndering into the station=20

and Blount picked up his hand-bag and went out, stumbling blindly in the un=
lighted passage at the=20

stair-head. And in the private office behind him the traffic manager was cr=
ushing his dead cigar in=20

his clenched hand and staring fixedly at the square of darkness framed by t=
he open window.=20

XIV  BARRIERS INVISIBLE   During the three weeks following the night journe=
y to Angora, a=20

journey on which he once more fought the hard battle to a still sharper con=
clusion, Evan Blount=20

scarcely saw his office in Temple Court for more than a brief hour or two a=
t a time. One speaking=20

appointment followed another in such rapid succession that he was constantl=
y going or returning;=20

and since there was everywhere a repetition of the welcome accorded him by =
the miners of the=20

Carnadine district, there was no reason save physical weariness to make him=
 wish to limit his=20

opportunity.  It was not until he was deep into the fourth week of the hurr=
yings to and fro that he=20

began to admit a suspicion which grew like a juggler's rose once he had giv=
en it place. Could it be=20

possible that these numerous invitations, coming now from all parts of the =
State, were purely=20

spontaneous? If not, if they were so many subtle moves in the great game, h=
e could see no=20

possible end to be subserved by them save one: they were effectually keepin=
g him away from the=20

capital, which was naturally the nucleus and centre of the campaign activit=
ies. Was there=20

something going on at headquarters that "the powers" did not wish him to fi=
nd out? Of one thing=20

he was well assured. Gantry was dodging him, was apparently keeping an accu=
rate record of his=20

movements; for whenever the hurryings permitted a flying return to the capi=
tal the traffic manager=20

was always out of town.  These were small matters, but vital in their way. =
Failing to keep in touch=20

with Gantry, Blount could never be sure that the policy of the railroad com=
pany had been reformed=20

or changed in any respect. Moreover, his journeyings, which brought him in =
direct contact with the=20

voters themselves, seemed to have the effect of isolating him curiously in =
the actual battle-field.=20

That a hot political campaign was raging throughout the length and breadth =
of the State was not to=20



be doubted; the newspapers were full of it, and in many districts the fight=
 had become acrimonious=20

and bitter. But although he was supposed to be in the thick of the fight, h=
e knew that he was not;=20

that some mysterious influence was shutting him out and holding him at arm'=
s length.  Everywhere=20

he went the cordial reception, the attentive and hospitable committeemen, t=
he packed house, and=20

the generous applause were always awaiting him. It was as if his progress h=
ad been carefully=20

prearranged, like a sort of triumphal procession. None the less, the invisi=
ble barrier--the barrier=20

which was excluding him from a hand-to-hand grapple with the inner workings=
 of the campaign--

was always there, and he could neither surmount it nor push it aside.  Notw=
ithstanding the hard=20

work and hard travelling, he did not allow the missionary effort and its cu=
rious isolation to obscure=20

in any sense the sturdier purpose. By every means he could devise he was ho=
lding his principals=20

up to the mirror of a vigilant watchfulness. Arguing that the opposition ne=
wspapers would be quick=20

to seize upon any charge of corruption involving the railroad company, he r=
ead them faithfully. As=20

yet there had been only innuendoes and a raking over of past misdeeds, thou=
gh by this time many=20

of the editors were openly claiming that the old alliance between the railr=
oad and the machine had=20

never been broken, and warning their readers accordingly.  Blount winced wh=
en he read such=20

editorials as these. Though he was going about, striving to Red Sea, have b=
een thrown up in=20

digging for the canal through Lake Timsah.  "We are approaching what is cal=
led the Serapeum,"=20

said the captain.  "What! more of them here? I thought we had used up all t=
he Serapeums," said=20

the magnate with a laugh.  "The present one is of a different sort," answer=
ed the commander. "But=20

the ruins found in this vicinity were supposed to belong to a Serapeum such=
 as several we have=20

seen on the Nile; but Lepsius says they could not have been a part of a tem=
ple to Serapis, but=20

were monuments built on the ancient canal by Darius.  "It is high ground he=
re, comparatively=20

speaking; and you observe that the cutting of the water-way is through a ro=
cky formation, with=20

rather high banks on each side. There is quite a little village above; and,=
 as it is getting dark, we=20

shall pass the night here in the siding-basin."  "Who is that man on the fo=
recastle of the Maud?"=20

asked Captain Scott as the little steamer came into the basin.  "I don't kn=
ow," replied Captain=20

Ringgold. "I had not noticed him before. He looks like an Arab, though he i=
s taller than most of=20

them."  A flight of steps ascended to the top of the embankment at the stat=
ion of the little town.=20

The Maud passed close to them on her way to her berth for the night. Abreas=
t of them the Arab on=20

the forecastle leaped ashore, but made a gesture as though the movement had=
 given him pain. He=20

went up the steps and disappeared.  "Who was that man, Knott?" asked the ca=
ptain when the=20

seaman came on board of the ship.  "I don't know, sir; I called upon him to=
 give an account of=20

himself as we were crossing Lake Timsah; but he could not understand me, po=
inted to his mouth,=20

and shook his head, meaning that he could not speak English. He did not do =
any harm, so I let him=20

alone; for Don was running the engine, and I did not like to call him from =
his duty. He kept his face=20

covered up with a sort of veil, and would not say anything. I thought I wou=
ld let him alone till we=20

came to a stopping-place, and I could report to you."  "When did he go on b=
oard of the Maud?"=20

asked the captain.  "I don't know, sir. The first time I saw him was on the=
 lake. Spinner had the=20

wheel, Don was in the engine-room, and the rest of the ship's company were =
on the upper deck=20

looking at the sights. I inquired, but no one had seen him."  "Did you ever=
 see him before?"  "I=20

don't think I ever did, sir. He had on what looked like a new suit of Arab =
togs, and he kept his face=20

covered up, as I said."  If Captain Ringgold was not troubled, he was perpl=
exed. He had observed=20



the stranger distinctly as he went up the steps, but he could not identify =
him as a person he had=20

ever seen before. Of course it came into his head at once that the tall Ara=
b was Captain Mazagan,=20

and he said as much to Scott.  "We left him at the hotel at Port Said; how =
could he be here?"=20

asked the captain of the Maud.  "He must have smuggled himself on board of =
the little steamer=20

when we were at Ismailia; for he was first seen out in the lake."  "How cou=
ld he have been at=20

Ismailia?" Scott inquired.  The commander went to his cabin, and looked ove=
r his "Bradshaw," in=20

which he found that a steamer left Port Said at seven o'clock every morning=
, and arrived at=20

Ismailia at noon. It was possible that Mazagan had come by this conveyance;=
 and he gave Scott=20

the information.  "Probably he stopped at the station while we were on boar=
d of the Ophir, or your=20

party had gone to the town," said the commander. "It was easy enough for hi=
m to stow himself=20

away in the cabin of the Maud while no one but Philip was on board of her."=
  "I supposed we had=20

got to the end of the pirate when I saw him trotted on shore to the hotel,"=
 added Scott.  "So did I,=20

though he made some huge but very indefinite threats when I saw him last," =
mused the=20

commander. "But why did he go on board of the Maud, when he could have gone=
 to Suez by the=20

railroad?"  "I don't see," replied Scott. "He is a Moor, and must be as rev=
engeful as his 'noble=20

master,' as he calls him. It was the Maud that did his business for him, an=
d I was at the wheel of=20

her when she smashed into the side of the Fatime. I only hope his grudge is=
 against me and not=20

against Louis Belgrave."  "You mention the idea I had in my mind when I ask=
ed why he went on=20

board of the Maud, Captain Scott," said the commander. "Perhaps it is a luc=
ky chance that I sent=20

for the 'Big Four' so that they might hear all that was said about the scen=
es through which we were=20

passing."  "You mean that it may have been a lucky chance for Louis or for =
me; but I believe it is a=20

luckier chance for the pirate, for I think I should have thrown him overboa=
rd if I had seen him on=20

our deck," said Scott.  "Then there would probably have been a fight on boa=
rd of the Maud, and=20

work made for our surgeon in your party. It may have been lucky for all tha=
t you were called on=20

board of the ship. But we must take care that he does not resume his voyage=
 in the morning with=20

us."  Captain Ringgold took all necessary precautions. A watch was kept on =
board of both vessels;=20

and when they started on the remainder of the trip through the canal in the=
 morning, nothing had=20

been seen or heard of Mazagan. It was agreed that nothing had better be sai=
d about the matter;=20

and when the cabin party, with the "Big Four," gathered on the promenade at=
 five o'clock in the=20

morning, not one of them, except the big and the little captain, suspected =
that an enemy was near,=20

if the stranger really was Mazagan, of which they could not be sure.     CH=
APTER XXIV  THE TOY=20

OF THE TRANSIT MANAGER   The village of Serapeum has had an existence of ov=
er=20


_
burden of the cruel responsibility he had voluntarily shouldered was never =
less than crushing. His=20

only hope lay in success. If he could make Gantry and his superiors come cl=
ean-handed to the=20

election, there need be no exposure, no cataclysm involving both the railro=
ad officials and his=20

father.  So ran the saving hope; and not content with mere watchfulness, Bl=
ount tried to get his=20

finger upon the pulse of occasions whenever he could. On his brief stop-ove=
rs in the capital its=20

pleasant little gardens looked very inviting in the fresh morning air to th=
e members of the cabin=20

party as they took their places on the promenade, which had come to be abou=
t as well defined as=20

their seats at the table. The air was soft and agreeable; and after their r=
efreshing sleep the tourists=20

were in excellent condition to enjoy the continued passage through the cana=
l, of which, however,=20

there were only about forty-one miles left, and the commander expected to b=
e=20


_
for the earliest hint of any charge of chicanery, and though he was unable =
to get hold of Gantry=20

personally, he kept up a steady fire of letters and telegrams, all pointing=
 to the same end--absolute=20

and utter good faith, and the upholding of his hands in the public plea for=
 a square deal. To these=20

the traffic manager always replied guardedly and optimistically. Everybody =
was delighted with the=20

good work done, and doing, by the railroad company's field manager; public =
opinion was slowly=20

but surely changing; let the good work go on--and much more to the same eff=
ect.  Blount did let=20

the good work go on; but as the critical pre-election weeks approached, he =
 Captain Ringgold had=20

not said anything to any person except Scott about the mysterious stranger =
with a veil over his=20

face; but the ship and her consort had been well guarded over night, and a =
search for stowaways=20

was made when the morning watch came on duty. Not even an Arab tramp could =
be found, and=20

the commander was confident the tall Mussulman had not again found a hiding=
-place on board of=20

either vessel.  "We shall soon have a change of scene," said Captain Ringgo=
ld, as he joined the=20

party on the promenade. "We are still in the desert, though the fresh-water=
 canal makes a streak=20

of green along its banks, for it extends to Suez, and even across the bay=
=20


_
little quiet investigation, which was made to dovetail cleverly with his sp=
eech-making journeys,=20

revealed--as Gantry had confessed it would--convincing evidence of past cor=
ruption and present=20

law-breaking. Hathaway had told the truth when he had asserted that his own=
 involvement was=20

only one of many similar bargains. Blount called upon the president of the =
Irrigation Alliance at=20

Romero, in the heart of the agricultural district, upon the managers of sev=
eral of the electric-power=20

companies, and upon a number of influential mining men--all shippers, and a=
ll large employers of=20

labor. It was the same story everywhere. Preferential freight rates had bee=
n given in return for=20

votes controlled, and the rates were still in effect.  The investigator tur=
ned sick at heart when these=20

men talked quite freely to him, thus showing conclusively that they were cy=
nically discounting his=20

public utterances. McDarragh, owner and manager of the "Wire-Gold" properti=
es in the Moscow=20

district, winked slyly when Blount cautiously inserted the probe.  "You're =
on, Mr. Blount. I sat up=20

there in the Op'ry-house last night listening to your game, and says I to m=
yself, 'Thim railroad shift-

bosses know their trade.' 'Twas a gr-reat talk you gave us, and it'll make =
the swinging of the har-

rd-rock vote as easy as twice two. Of course, we have a thin paring on the =
ore rate; you'll be=20

knowing that as well as annybody in the game, I'm thinking. 'Tis well that =
we fellows at the top=20

know how to make one hand wash the other. Come again, Mr. Blount, and give =
my regards to the=20

sinator when ye see him. And ye might whisper in his ear that it's a waste =
of good wor-rk for him to=20

be sinding his gum-shoe wire-pullers to be laboring with our min. We're saf=
e as the clock up here=20

in the Moscow."  This was not the first hint that Blount had been given poi=
nting to the underground=20

work of the machine. That this work was being directed toward the subversio=
n of the popular will,=20

he made no doubt; and there were times when he was strongly tempted to carr=
y the war boldly=20

into the wider field of graft and bossism. That he postponed the bigger bat=
tle was due quite as=20

much to the singleness of purpose which was his best gift as to the desire =
to spare his father.=20

Telling himself resolutely that the reformation of the railroad company's p=
olitical methods was his=20

chief object, and the only one which warranted him in retaining his place o=
n the Company's=20

payrolls, he held aloof when his father's name was mentioned and bent himse=
lf to the task of=20

providing the means for the subjugation of Gantry--and of Gantry's and his =
own superiors, if need=20

be.  The securing of evidence of the kind which would really give him the w=
hip-hand promised to=20

be a delicate undertaking. Men like McDarragh talked openly enough about th=
e illegal special=20

freight rates, but talk was not evidence. Curiously enough, while he was tr=
ying to devise some way=20

of obtaining the tangible proof without using his semiofficial position in =
the company's service as a=20

lever, the thing itself was thrown at him. From some mysterious source a ru=
mor went out that the=20

special rates were in jeopardy; and the very men with whom he had talked be=
gan to write him=20

importunate letters begging him to deny the rumor. With a sheaf of these le=
tters in his pocket,=20

each one inculpating both parties to the illegal "deals," Blount grew gayly=
 exultant. The natural=20

inference was that Gantry and "the powers" had been finally forced to yield=
--that he had won his=20

victory. But if he had not yet won it, chance, or something better, had pla=
ced in his hands the=20

weapon with which he could compel a return to fair dealing and honesty.  It=
 was on a second=20

speech-making visit to Ophir that Blount had his first face-to-face chance =
at Gantry. A meeting of=20

the Mine-Owners' Association, moving for a readjustment of the classificati=
on on copper matte and=20

bullion at a time when the railroad company might be supposed to be on the =
giving hand, brought=20

Gantry to the gold camp in the Carnadine Hills, and the first man he met at=
 the hotel was the=20



stubborn dictator of new policies for the Transcontinental Company.  "Hello=
, Dick! made a mistake,=20

didn't you--coming while I was here?" said the reformer, with a very lifeli=
ke replica of his father's=20

grim smile. "I suppose you have an immediate engagement to go somewhere els=
e, or to do=20

something that will give you a chance to dodge?"  "No; I wish to the Lord I=
 had!" was the hearty=20

admission. "You're a fright, Evan; you are getting to be a perfect nightmar=
e, with your letters and=20

telegrams. You've got me so I'm afraid to open my desk."  Blount nodded gra=
vely. "I'm glad the=20

letters and telegrams have had their effect at last," he rejoined.  "Had th=
eir effect? Yes, they've=20

had the effect of turning my hair gray, if that's what you mean."  "I think=
 you know what I mean,=20

Dick."  "I'll be hanged if I do. What are you driving at?"  "At the fact th=
at you have finally concluded=20

to cancel the crooked deals with--wait, and I'll give you the names of the =
co-respondents"--and he=20

drew a packet of neatly docketed letters from his pocket.  "Hold on a minut=
e," protested the traffic=20

manager; "you're getting in rather too deep for me. Will you let me see tho=
se letters?"  Blount put=20

the letters back into his pocket and mechanically buttoned his light top-co=
at over them for=20

additional safety.  "Do you mean to say that you haven't passed the word to=
 Hathaway and=20

McDarragh and a dozen others I could name?" he asked.  "Of course I haven't=
. You call yourself a=20

lawyer, and yet you ask us to set aside promises that are, or ought to be, =
as binding as so many=20

written contracts with penalties attached. You're crazy, Evan; it can't be =
done, and that's all there=20

is to it."  Blount was frowning thoughtfully. "'Can't' goes out of the wind=
ow when 'must' comes in at=20

the door, Dick. You remember what I told you--that I'd get evidence, lawyer=
-fashion. I've got it;=20

evidence of the sort that would turn the people of this State into a howlin=
g mob to tear up your=20

tracks if I should publish it."  "But I tell you we _can't_ withdraw the sp=
ecials, you wild-eyed=20

fanatic!"  "All right; then level down the public's rates to fit them. And =
do it quickly, old man. The=20

time is growing fearfully short, and my patience isn't what it used to be."=
  "My Lord! anybody would=20

think you owned the Transcontinental Company, lock, stock, and barrel! Wher=
e under heaven did=20

you get your nerve, Evan? Blest if I don't believe you could out-bluff the =
old--er--your father,=20

himself, if you once got the fool notion into your head that it was your du=
ty to try!"  "You are side-

stepping again, Dick, and that won't go any longer. You've got to fish or c=
ut bait, and do one or=20

"The prospect is not very exciting just now," added Mr. Woolridge, as the s=
crew began to turn, and=20

the ship moved away from her moorings.  "We shall come to the larger of the=
 Bitter Lakes in less=20

than an hour," replied the captain. "There is nothing very exciting about t=
hem; but Brugsch=20

identifies these lakes with the Marah of the Bible, though others do not ag=
ree with him. In Exodus=20

xv. 23 we read," and the speaker took a paper from his pocket: "'And when t=
hey came to Marah,=20

they could not drink of the waters ... for they were bitter: therefore the =
name of it was called=20

Marah.' But the bitter spring which Moses sweetened by casting into it a tr=
ee is in the peninsula of=20

Sinai."  "Shall we go there?" asked Mrs. Blossom, beginning to be excited, =
as she always was=20

when scriptural subjects came up in connection with the journey; and she ha=
d studied the Bible=20

more than any other book, and probably more than all others combined.  "At =
the proper time I shall=20

have something to say about Mount Sinai, and I hope to place you in a posit=
ion to see it in the=20

distance; but at present we are not prepared to consider the matter. You ca=
n now see through the=20

cutting an expanse of water, which is the great basin, as the larger lake i=
s called.  "As stated=20

before, the Red Sea formerly extended to Lake Timsah, over forty miles fart=
her than now, and the=20

lakes before us were then a part of the sea. The deepest water was twenty-f=
our to forty feet below=20



the Mediterranean, with a heavy crust of salt on the bottom, though the sma=
ller basin required a=20

great deal of dredging. In the spring of 1869 the Prince and Princess of Wa=
les were present in this=20

locality, and took part in the ceremonial of 'letting in the waters.'"  "'W=
ails for the multitude of=20

Egypt,'" added Uncle Moses.  "Ezekiel, chapter and verse forgotten," replie=
d the commander.=20

"Thirty-two, eighteen," said the bulky lawyer.  "Are there any whales in th=
e lake?" asked Felix.=20

"You can fish for them, my lad; but the particular Waleses of whom I spoke =
were not 'in it,'"=20

continued the captain. "These Wales did not spout, though they probably sai=
d something; but they=20

let in the water instead of blowing it out, as respectable whales do at sea=
. The waters of the two=20

seas came together, and notwithstanding the joyousness of the occasion, the=
 meeting was not=20

altogether amiable and pleasant at first. Each representative of the differ=
ent bodies seemed to=20

pitch into the other, and the onslaught created a great commotion for a tim=
e. If they were ever=20

united before in the distant past, they appeared to have forgotten all abou=
t it.  "The war was short=20

and decisive, and the waters soon settled down into a peaceful condition, a=
s you will find them to-

day. They have apparently shaken hands, and accepted the task of promoting =
the commerce of=20

the world. But here we come to the great basin. The lake is about six miles=
 wide. Here is the=20

lighthouse, and there is another at the other end of it, each of them sixty=
-five feet high."  The=20

shores of the lake are flat and sandy, and the water is of a bluish green h=
ue. There is a well-

defined channel through it. As there is no longer any danger of washing the=
 banks of the canal,=20

steamers increase their speed, and the Guardian-Mother made the next twenty=
 miles in less than=20

two hours. As the captain had promised, it was a change of scene, and it wa=
s very agreeable to=20

the party. In the distance could be seen the Geneffeh range of hills, which=
 were a relief in the=20

landscape from the desert. In them are rich quarries of marble and limeston=
e which are profitably=20

worked.  The passage through the canal had become monotonous to the travell=
ers after they had=20

passed through the lakes, for it was a desert on both sides. Shortly after,=
 the water-way was cut=20

through sandstone, and after that the soil was clay, or a mixture of it wit=
h lime; but the last part of=20

the course was through depths of sand again. The tide on the Red Sea rises =
from five to seven=20

feet, and its flow extends about four miles up the canal.  "Looking ahead, =
you can see an expanse=20

of water, which means that we are coming to the end of our canal travel," s=
aid the commander. "I=20

suppose no one will be sorry for it; for we have had all our social arrange=
ments as usual, and=20

there has been something to see and much to learn all the way."  "It has no=
t been at all like my=20

canal travel at home," added Uncle Moses, who was the oldest person on boar=
d of the ship by one=20

month, by which time Dr. Hawkes was his junior, and they were only fifty-fo=
ur. "I went from=20

Syracuse to Oswego by a canal boat when I was a young man. The trip was in =
the night, and I=20

slept on a swinging shelf, held up by ropes; and we were bumping much of th=
e time in the locks so=20

that I did not sleep so well as I did last night. But what water have we ah=
ead, Captain?"  "It is an=20

arm of the Gulf of Suez, which is itself one of the two great arms of the R=
ed Sea."  "It appears to=20

be well armed," said Uncle Moses, who could be guilty of a pun on extreme p=
rovocation.  "Like=20

yourself, it is provided with two arms, but it does not shoot with them," r=
eplied the captain. "On our=20

left are the ruins of Arsinoe, which was an ancient port, once called Croco=
dilopolis; and, by the=20

way, Lake Timsah was once Crocodile Lake, and doubtless the saurians former=
ly sported in its=20

waters."  "About Arsinoe?" suggested the professor.  "Probably you know mor=
e about it than I do,=20

Professor."  "I know little except that it was a commercial city of Egypt, =
built by Ptolemy II. The=20



name is that of several females distinguished in one way or another in the =
ancient world, and the=20

word is usually written with a diaeresis over the final _e_, so that it is =
pronounced as though it=20

were written Arsinoey. The city thrived for a time, and was the emporium of=
 eastern Egypt; but the=20

perils of the navigation in the north of the Red Sea diverted the trade int=
o other channels, and the=20

place went to decay. It was named by Ptolemy after his sister, who was marr=
ied at sixteen to the=20

aged king of Thrace. There is a bloody story connected with her life, which=
 I will not repeat; but in=20

the end she fled to the protection of her brother in Egypt, and after the f=
ashion of that age and=20

country, he made her his wife."  "You have not been in Asia any of you yet,=
 or even as near that=20

continent before as you are at this moment," continued the commander, as th=
e ship passed out of=20

the canal into the gulf.  "I thought we had been in Asia," interposed Mrs. =
Belgrave.  "Certainly we=20

have," added half a dozen others.  "Isn't Scutari in Asia, Captain?" asked =
the lady.  "To be sure it=20

is, and we all went over there from Constantinople," replied the commander.=
 "I had forgotten that,=20

and you are not=20


_
"I'd cut the bait all right, if I were Mr. McVickar, Evan. I'd fire you so =
blamed far that you wouldn't=20

be able to find your way back in a month of Sundays."  Blount tapped his po=
cket. "As long as I=20

have these documents, Mr. McVickar doesn't dare to fire me. And if you and =
he don't come down=20

within the next few days--yes, it's a matter of days, now--I'll fire myself=
 and go over every foot of=20

the ground again, telling what I know."  Gantry's eyes darkened. He had gra=
duated with honors=20

from the particular department in railroading in which patience is more tha=
n a virtue. Yet there are=20

limits.  "You seem to have entirely forgotten that little talk we had in my=
 office the night you were=20

going to Angora," he said.  "No; I haven't forgotten it--not for a single w=
aking minute."  "What I said=20

to you then goes as it lies," was the threatening reminder. "If you pull th=
e props out, there'll be=20

more than one death in the family."  "You mean that you, or Mr. McVickar, w=
ill make it a point to=20

include my father; I've wrestled that out, too, Dick. I'm going to try to p=
ull him out of it, but whether I=20

succeed or fail, the consequences will be the same for you fellows. Come an=
d hear me speak to-

night, Dick--if you're stopping over that long. Then you'll know how much i=
n earnest--how deadly in=20

earnest--I am. You spoke of my innocent as I began to make it appear. But y=
ou have Asia on one=20

side and Europe on the other."  "Well, we had that on the Bosporus, when we=
 made that trip to the=20

Black Sea in the Maud," added the lady, who seemed to be pleased because sh=
e had caught the=20

captain in a blunder.  "Then you have been in all the grand divisions of th=
e earth except South=20

America, and I have no doubt you will go there before we come to the finish=
 of this voyage. Here is=20

the station; and you observe that there is a bridge across the canal by whi=
ch the traveller can=20

proceed to Suez, which you can see upon the point on the other side. The do=
nkeys and donkey-

boys abound here as everywhere in Egypt, and boats can be obtained to ferry=
 you over to the=20

town. But as we shall remain here a day or two, I think we had better go in=
to the basin. We can=20

then go where we please in the Maud."  It was lunch time when the two vesse=
ls had been=20

secured, and the party adjourned to the cabin. As soon as the meal was disp=
osed of they returned=20

to the upper deck, and seated themselves in the arm-chairs, for there was m=
uch to be seen. Port=20

Tewfik is the proper name of the place at the station, but most of the peop=
le are Frenchmen, and=20

they all call it Terreplein.  "At this station the office of the canal comp=
any, which you can see from=20

the deck, is located. It=20
