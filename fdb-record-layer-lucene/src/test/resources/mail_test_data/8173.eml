philodendron monstera darling is? Did she not share my secret? And she was so proud of me and she always would believe I was a genius.

at last, in a very common-sense voice--  "It's as clear as a pikestaff to Jemima Dredge that that 

sweet little child has been tampered with. Somebody has been frightening the bit of a thing, Miss 

Primrose, and it's for you to find out who that somebody is. As to where she's gone? Why, she has 

gone back to where she was born, of course, and you and me will follow her by the first train in the 

The big shoulders gave a decided heave. "That's wuth more to me than all the money in the 

world."  "Then, why didn't you come to me?"  "I didn't think of doing that."  "Oh, Uncle Josiah!" 

"Yes, I sold my boat. There wa'n't no wonder I was singing, was there?" he asked, passing his 

hand across his face as if to clear his vision. "I cal'late that song wa'n't much like music to you, but

"She was taking care of a cheque of mine for seventeen pounds ten shillings," exclaimed 

Primrose, "and in her little note she speaks of the money being lost. I think nothing of the loss of 

the money beside Daisy, but, Mrs. Dredge, Jasmine and I cannot afford even a third-class ticket to 

Rosebury just at present."  "Tut, tut, my dear," said Mrs. Dredge, "what's the good of a full purse 

except to share it? My poor husband Joshua was his name--we was two J's, dear--he always said, 

'Jemima, thank God the chandlery is prospering. A full purse means light hearts, Jemima. We can 

shed blessings with our means, Jemima.' Those was Joshua's words, Miss Mainwaring, and I hear 

him now telling them to me from his grave. You had to do something to keep my feelings afloat, 

didn't I, Beth?"  "Yes."  "I sold her," he said, speaking as though his thoughts were coming by way 

of his tongue. "It wa'n't easy. Just like parting with an old friend. It sort of pulled on me. Odd, ain't 

it, how an old boat like that can get a hold on a feller?"  "No, it is not odd. Some of the happiest 

moments of my life were spent on board the _Jennie P._"  "Do you honest feel that way about 

her?"  "Yes."  "I'm mighty glad, Beth," he said, his eyes gleaming with pride. "She sartin was a 

worthy craft."  "Who bought your boat?"  "Feller by the name of Peters, who runs a fish business 

down on East River near Brooklyn bridge. I knew him years ago. His wife's name

and me will go down to Rosebury in the morning, dear, and Miss Jasmine will stay at home with 

Sarah Mary for company, for there's no sense in waste, and one of you is quite enough to come." 

While this conversation was going on Bridget knocked at the girls' door, and presented Jasmine 

with a thick parcel, which had just arrived for her by post. It was some of the manuscript, and the 

first proofs of her story. The parcel came to hand at a sorrowful moment, and Jasmine laid it on 

the sofa, made no comment about it, and did not attempt to open it. Primrose scarcely raised her 

head from her hands, and was not the least curious, but Poppy's eyes gleamed brightly, for sharp 

Poppy guessed what the parcel contained, and she sincerely hoped that whatever happened this 

story would prove a great success, and that it would bring in so many Jennie, and I named my 

boat after her 'cause he was the first man to help me sail her."  "Why did you go to him without first 

telling me?"  "There wa'n't no time to tell no one. You'd not likely----"  "Oh, you men! You treat us 

women as if we were numskulls. If you had given me the slightest idea that you intended to sell I 

should have put in my bid along with others."  "Do you mean you would have bought my _Jennie 

P._?"  "Why not, pray tell? Haven't I as much right to own a boat as any man you know?"  "I do 

believe you'd have bought her, sartin as death!"  "Of course I should. If----" Her eyes suddenly 

widened. "Why did you sell?"  "Same as I said afore, I didn't have no need of her, and she was 

getting expensive to keep up." His face darkened, and an expression of pain shot through the 

shadows.  "You said you were not going

would become not only rich herself, but able to pay back what she had borrowed from her. For 

although Poppy was the soul of generosity, she _did_ want her wages back.     CHAPTER XLII.  A 

NEW EMPLOYMENT.   At an early hour the next morning Mrs. Dredge and Primrose started for 

Rosebury, and poor Jasmine and Poppy prepared to have a long and lonely time by themselves. 

Poppy hoped that Jasmine would cheer up, and look at that lovely printed story of hers, and 

perhaps read it aloud to her; but poor Jasmine was really nearly broken-hearted, and said once 

almost passionately--  "How can I look at it, reason."  "I can't."  "In other words, that is the secret of 

your mysterious trip to the city."  "Yes, that's my secret."  "My dear old Uncle!" she cried. "I know 

your secret! You sold your boat to get money with which to pay Father. You've sold your one little 

luxury to pay a debt you can never pay."  "You're mistook. I can pay your father every cent I got 

from him to overhaul my place."  "But that isn't all!"  "It ain't all?"  "I thought I could tell you all 

about it, but I can't!"  "Do you mean you've something you want to say to me, Beth?"  "I can't! I 

can't! It is so----"  She broke down and
