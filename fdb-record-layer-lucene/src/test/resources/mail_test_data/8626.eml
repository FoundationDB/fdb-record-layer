philodendron monstera bony frame, or shell, that includes the head, and ext=

 of him for some time.  How did he get to know of it? was the question he w=
as revolving in his mind. It was very simple. That sly Prepelicza had easil=
y found out in Besztercebanya that Pal Gregorics had more than one philoden=
dron monstera bony frame, or shell, that includes the head, and extends ove=
r more than half the body; this has two long and moveable spikes beneath th=
e fore fins, upon which it can raise itself as upon legs when upon the land=
; when first caught, this fish makes a noise something like the mewing of a=
  "The wretch!" he hissed. And then he sat staring fixedly in front of him =
for some time.  How did he get to know of it? was the question he was revol=
ving in his mind. It was very simple. That sly Prepelicza had easily found =
out in Besztercebanya that Pal Gregorics had more than one _
forbidden fruit from morning until night, and a grievous attack of diarrhoe=
a was the consequence.=20

My wife had boiled the fruit with wild honey, and had made a most delicious=
 preserve; in this state=20

it was not unwholesome. She had likewise preserved the fruit of the nabbuk =
in a similar manner:=20

the latter resembles minute apples in appearance, with something of the med=
lar in flavour;=20

enormous quantities were produced upon the banks of the river, which, falli=
ng when ripe, were=20

greedily eaten by guinea-fowl, wild hogs, antelopes, and monkeys. Elephants=
 are particularly fond=20

of the fruit of the hegleek, which, although apparently too insignificant f=
or the attention of such=20

mighty animals, they nevertheless enjoy beyond any other food, and they ind=
ustriously gather=20

them one by one. At the season when the fruit is ripe, the hegleek tree is =
a certain attraction to=20

elephants, who shake the branches and pick up the fallen berries with their=
 trunks; frequently they=20

overturn the tree itself, as a more direct manner of feeding.  Florian was =
quite incapable of=20

hunting, as he was in a weak state of health, and had for some months been =
suffering from=20

chronic dysentery. I had several times cured him, but, as Barrake insisted =
upon eating fruit, so he=20

had a weakness for the strongest black coffee, which, instead of drinking, =
like the natives, in=20

minute cups, he swallowed wholesale in large basins, several times a day; t=
his was actual poison=20

with his complaint, and he was completely ruined in health. He had excellen=
t servants,--Richarn,=20

whom I subsequently engaged, who was my only faithful man in my journey up =
the White Nile, and=20

two good Dongalowas.  At this time, his old companion, Johann Schmidt, the =
carpenter, arrived,=20

having undertaken a contract to provide, for the Italian Zoological Gardens=
, a number of animals. I=20

therefore proposed that the two old friends should continue together, while=
 I would hunt by myself,=20

with the aggageers, towards the east and south.  This arrangement was agree=
d to, and we parted.=20

In the following season, I engaged this excellent man, Johann Schmidt, as m=
y lieutenant for the=20

White Nile expedition, on the banks of which fatal river he now lies, with =
the cross that I erected=20

over his grave.  Poor Florian at length recovered from his complaint, but w=
as killed by a lion. He=20

had wounded an elephant, which on the following morning he found dead; a li=
on had eaten a=20

portion during the night. While he was engaged with his men in extracting t=
he tusks, one of his=20

hunters (a Tokroori) followed the track of the lion on the sand, and found =
the animal lying beneath=20

a bush; he fired a single-barrelled rifle, and wounded it in the thigh. He =
at once returned to his=20

master, who accompanied him to the spot, and the lion was found lying under=
 the same bush,=20

licking the wound. Florian fired and missed; the lion immediately crouched =
for a spring; Florian=20

fired his remaining barrel, the ball merely grazed the lion, who almost in =
the same instant bounded=20

forward, and struck him upon the head with a fearful blow of the paw, at th=
e same time it seized=20

him by the throat.  The Tokroori hunter, instead of flying from the danger,=
 placed the muzzle of his=20

rifle to the lion's ear, and blew its brains out on the body of his master.=
 The unfortunate Florian had=20

been struck dead, and great difficulty was found in extracting the claws of=
 the lion, which had=20

penetrated the skull. Florian, although a determined hunter, was an exceedi=
ngly bad shot, and=20

withal badly armed for encounters with dangerous game; I had frequently pro=
phesied some=20

calamity from the experience I had had in a few days' shooting in his socie=
ty, and most unhappily=20

my gloomy prediction was fulfilled.  This was the fate of two good and ster=
ling Germans, who had=20

been my companions in this wild country, where degrees of rank are entirely=
 forgotten, provided a=20

man be honest and true. I constantly look back to the European acquaintance=
s and friends that I=20

made during my sojourn in Africa, nearly all of whom are dead: a merciful P=
rovidence guided us=20



through many dangers and difficulties, and shielded us from all harm, durin=
g nearly five years of=20

heart! You can't expect me to give you two hundred florins, and then give y=
ou a hot roll to carry in=20

your heart. Don't be a fool, man."  Prepelicza smiled at this, but he put h=
is big red hands behind=20

his back, a sign that he did not intend to touch the money.  "Perhaps you f=
ind it too little?"  Not a=20

word did he answer, only pushed his hair up in front, till he looked like a=
 sick cockatoo; then, after=20

a few moments, raised his glass to his lips, and drained it to the dregs, a=
nd then put it back on the=20

table so brusquely that it broke.  "It is disgraceful!" he burst out; "a po=
or man's honor is only worth=20

two hundred florins, though God created us all equal, and He gave me my hon=
or as well as to the=20

bishop or to Baron Radvanszky. And yet you tax mine at two hundred florins.=
 It's a shame!"  Upon=20

that Gaspar decided to play his trump.  "Very well, Prepelicza, you needn't=
 be so cross. If your=20

honor is so dear, I'll look for cheaper."  And with that he put back the tw=
o bank-notes in his pocket.=20

"I'll look up your companion, the other mason."  Then he called the head wa=
iter, in order to pay for=20

the wine. Prepelicza smiled.  "Well, well, can't a poor man give his opinio=
n? Of course you can=20

look up the other man, and he won't be as honest as I, probably. But ... we=
ll, put another fifty to it,=20

and I'll tell you all."  "Very well. It's a bargain!"  And the mason began =
to relate the events of that=20

memorable night, and how they had carried the caldron through the courtyard=
 and garden to a=20

small house.  "To the 'Lebanon'!" exclaimed Gaspar excitedly. "To that boy'=
s house!"  And the=20

mason went on to tell how Gregorics had stood by while they had walled in t=
he caldron, and=20

watched every movement, Gaspar throwing in a question now and then.  "Was i=
t heavy?"  "Very=20

heavy."  "Did no one see you as you passed through the courtyard?"  "No one=
; every one had=20

gone to bed."  Gaspar was quite excited, and seemed to enjoy every word he =
heard; his eyes=20

shone, his thoughts were occupied with the future, in which he imagined him=
self a rich man, the=20

owner of untold wealth. He might even buy a baronetcy! Baron Gaspar Gregori=
cs! How well it=20

sounded! And Minka would be a little baroness. That fool of a Pal had not k=
nown how to make=20

proper use of his wealth, so it must have increased immensely, he had been =
so economical!  "And=20

what did my brother pay you for your work?"  "He gave us each fifty florins=
."  "That was quite right=20

of him."  A weight had fallen from his heart at these words, for he had beg=
un to fear Gregorics had=20

given them some thousands to buy their silence, and that would have been a =
great pity, as it=20

would have diminished the sum he hoped to possess before long. For he had d=
ecided to buy=20

"Lebanon," with its caldron and its orchard. He would go to-morrow to that =
boy's guardian and=20

make an offer for it. And he rejoiced inwardly at the trick he was playing =
his brother and sister.  He=20

returned home as fast as horses could take him, and did not even stop at hi=
s own house, but went=20

straight on to Sztolarik's and informed him he would like to buy "Lebanon."=
  This was the name=20

they had given to the orchard and house old Gregorics had bought of the cle=
rgyman's widow. He=20

had tried to grow cedars there at first, but the soil of Besztercebanya was=
 not suitable for these=20

trees, and the sarcastic inhabitants of the small town christened the orcha=
rd "Lebanon."  Mr.=20

Sztolarik showed no surprise at the offer.  "So you want to buy 'Lebanon'?"=
 he said. "It is a good=20

orchard, and produces the finest fruit imaginable. This year a well-known h=
otel-keeper bought all=20

the fruit, and paid an enormous price for it. But what made you think of bu=
ying 'Lebanon'?"  "I=20

should like to build a house there, a larger house than the present one."  =
"H'm! There is always a=20

good deal of bother attached to a purchase of that kind," said Sztolarik co=
ldly; "the present owner=20

is a minor, and the Court of Chancery must give permission for the sale to =
take place. I would=20



rather leave things as they are. When the boy is of age he may do what he l=
ikes, but if I sell it now=20

he may be sorry for it later on. No, no, Mr. Gregorics, I can't agree to it=
.=20


_
Our camels returned from Geera with corn, accompanied by an Abyssinian hunt=
er, who was=20

declared by Abou Do to be a good man, and dexterous with the sword. We acco=
rdingly moved our=20

camp, said adieu to Florian and Johann, and penetrated still deeper into th=
e Base.   CHAPTER=20

XV.  are a _pretium affectionis_ for the boy; he spent his childhood there.=
"  "But if I offer a good=20

sum for it," broke in Gaspar, nervously.  Sztolarik began to feel curious. =
 "What do you consider a=20

good sum? What do you think of offering for it?"  "Why, I would give--" and=
 here he was=20


_
OUR course lay as usual along the banks of the river, which we several time=
s forded to avoid the=20

bends. Great numbers of antelopes were upon the river's bed, having descend=
ed to drink; by=20

making a circuit, I cut off one party upon their retreat, and made two good=
 shots with the Fletcher=20

No. 24, bagging two tetel (Antelopus Bubalis), at considerable ranges. I al=
so shot an ariel (G.=20

Dama), and, upon arriving at a deep pool in the river, I shot a bull hippop=
otamus, as a present for=20

Taher Sheriff and his brothers. We decided upon encamping at a spot known t=
o the Arabs as=20

Delladilla; this was the forest upon the margin of the river where I had fi=
rst shot the bull elephant,=20

when the aggageers fought with him upon foot. The trees were larger in this=
 locality than=20

elsewhere, as a great portion of the country was flooded by the river dnrin=
g the rainy season, and=20

much rich soil had been deposited; this, with excessive moisture, had produ=
ced a forest of fine=20

timber, with an undergrowth of thick nabbuk. We fixed upon a charming spot =
for a camp, beneath=20

a large tree that bore a peculiar fruit, suspended from the branches by a s=
trong but single fibre,=20

like a cord; each fruit was about eighteen inches in length, by six in diam=
eter; it was perfectly=20

worthless, but extremely ornamental. We had arrived beneath this tree, and =
were still on=20

horseback; my wife had just suggested that it would be unpleasant should on=
e of the large fruit fall=20

upon our heads if we camped under the branches, when suddenly a lioness gli=
ded by us, within=20

three yards of the horses, and almost immediately disappeared in the thick =
thorns; unfortunately, I=20

had the moment before given my rifle to a servant, prior to dismounting. I =
searched the bushes in=20

every direction, but to no purpose.  This spot was so favourably situated t=
hat I determined to=20

remain for some time, as I could explore the country on horseback to a grea=
t distance upon all=20

sides. We immediately which made him turn as red as a peony--"I would give =
15,000 florins."=20

Well, that was a brilliant offer, for Pal Gregorics had bought it of the cl=
ergyman's widow for 5000=20

florins. It was only a small bit of ground, and a good way from the market,=
 which decreased its=20

value exceedingly.  "Utcumque," said Sztolarik, "your offer is a good one. =
But, but ... well, I'll tell=20

you what, Mr. Gregorics, I'll consider your offer a bit, and I must write t=
o the boy about it too, and=20

also speak to his mother."  "But I want to settle it as soon as possible." =
 "I'll write about it to-day."=20

Gaspar did not wish to say any more about the matter, for fear of awakening=
 the lawyer's=20

suspicions, but a day or two afterward he sent a tiny cask of Tokay wine to=
 him (some Pal=20

Gregorics had left in his cellar, and which they had divided among them), w=
ith the inquiry as to=20

whether he had any answer from Budapest. Sztolarik sent back word he expect=
ed a letter every=20

minute, and thanked him very much for the wine; he also remarked to the foo=
tman who had=20

brought it that he hoped it would go smoothly, but whether he meant the win=
e, or something else,=20

the footman did not quite understand.  Hardly had the man gone, when the ex=
pected letter arrived,=20

containing the news that Gyuri agreed to the sale of the orchard, and Sztol=
arik was just going to=20

send one of his clerks to Gaspar, when the door opened, and in walked Boldi=
zsar Gregorics,=20

puffing and blowing from the haste he had made.  "Pray take a seat, Mr. Gre=
gorics. To what do I=20

owe the honor of your visit?"  "I've brought you a lot of money," gasped Bo=
ldizsar, still out of=20

breath.  "We can always do with plenty of that," said the lawyer.  "I want =
to buy that poor orphan's=20

little bit of property, 'Lebanon.'"  "'Lebanon'?" repeated Sztolarik, surpr=
ised. "What on earth is the=20

matter with them all?" he muttered to himself; then continued out loud: "Pe=
rhaps you want it for=20

your brother?"  "No, no, I want=20


_
construct our new camp, and by the evening our people had cleared a circle =
of fifty yards=20

diameter; this was swept perfectly clean, and the ground being hard, though=
 free from stones, the=20

surface was as even as a paved floor. The entire circle was well protected =
with a strong fence of=20

thorn bushes, for which the kittar is admirably adapted; the head being mus=
hroom-shaped, the=20

entire tree is cut down, and the stem being drawn towards the inside of the=
 camp, the thick and=20

wide-spreading thorny crest covers about twelve feet of the exterior fronta=
ge; a fence thus=20

arranged is quickly constructed, and is quite impervious. Two or three larg=
e trees grew within the=20

camp; beneath the shade of this our tent was pitched. This we never inhabit=
ed, but it served as an=20

ordinary room, and a protection to the luggage, guns, &c. The there is so l=
ovely, and the fruit-trees=20

are so good."  "It is really strange, very strange!"  "Why is it strange?" =
said the other, surprised.=20

"Because I have already one purchaser in view."  "Well, we won't let him ha=
ve it. I daresay I can=20

offer you more than he."  "I doubt it," said the lawyer; "the first offer w=
as 15,000 florins."  Boldizsar=20

showed no surprise.  "Well, I offer 20,000."  Not till after he had said it=
 did it occur to him that the=20

orchard was not worth even 15,000 florins, and he turned impatiently and as=
ked:  "Who is the fool=20

who offers so much?"  "Your brother Gaspar."  At this name Boldizsar turned=
 deathly pale, and=20

dropped gasping on to a chair. His lips moved, but no sound came from them,=
 and Sztolarik=20

thought he would have a stroke, and rushed out for some water, calling for =
help as he went;=20


_
horses were well secured within a double circle of thorns, and the goats wa=
ndered about at liberty,=20

as they were too afraid of wild animals to venture from the camp: altogethe=
r this was the most=20

agreeable spot we had ever occupied; even the night-fires would be perfectl=
y concealed within the=20

dense shade of the nabbuk jungle, thus neither man nor beast would be aware=
 of our presence.=20

We were about a hundred paces distant from the margin of the river; late in=
 the evening I took my=20

rod, and fished in the deep bend beneath a cliff of conglomerate pebbles. I=
 caught only one fish, a=20

baggar, about twelve pounds, but I landed three large turtles; these creatu=
res were most=20

determined in taking the bait; they varied in size from fifty to about nine=
ty pounds, and were the=20

same species as that which inhabits the Nile (Trionis Nilotica). From one o=
f them we took upwards=20

of a hundred eggs which we converted into omelettes, but they were rather s=
trong in flavour.=20

Although this species of turtle rolling-pin and a jug of water, the old gen=
tleman had recovered, and=20

began to excuse himself.  "I felt a bit giddy; I often have attacks like th=
is. I'm getting old, you see.=20

And now to return to our discussion. Yes, I'll give you 20,000 florins for =
'Lebanon,' and pay the=20

money down."  The lawyer thought a minute, then said:  "We can't manage thi=
ngs so quickly, for=20

we must have the consent of the Court of Chancery. I'll see about it at onc=
e."  And he was as good=20

as his word, for such an advantageous sale of the orchard he had never dare=
d to hope for. But all=20

the time he was wondering why the two Gregorics were so anxious to have it.=
 There must be=20

some reason for it. Supposing they had struck upon some treasure there, it =
was not impossible, for=20

had not King Arpad and his successors lived about here? He decided to send =
Istvan Drotler, the=20

civil engineer, to have a look at the place, and see if it contained gold o=
r coal. But before he had=20

time to start for the engineer's, Gaspar=20


_
having a head very like that of a snake, with a dark green shell spotted wi=
th yellow, it produces=20

excellent soup; the body is exceedingly flat, and the projecting edges of t=
he shell are soft; it runs=20

extremely fast upon the shore, and is suggestive of the tortoise that beat =
the hare in the well-

known race. Throughout the Nile and its tributaries there are varieties of =
fish and reptiles closely=20

connected, and the link can be distinctly traced in the progression of deve=
lopment. There is a fish=20

with appeared on the scene, to ask if there were any letter from Pest. Szto=
larik was in difficulties.=20

"The letter is here, yes, the letter is here; but something else has happen=
ed. Another purchaser=20

has turned up, and he offers 20,000 florins for 'Lebanon.'"  This was evide=
ntly a great blow for=20

Gaspar.  "Impossible," he stammered. "Is it Boldizsar?"  "Yes."  Gaspar was=
 furious; he began to=20

swear like a trooper, and waved his stick about, thereby knocking down one =
of Mrs. Sztolarik's=20

flower-pots, in=20
