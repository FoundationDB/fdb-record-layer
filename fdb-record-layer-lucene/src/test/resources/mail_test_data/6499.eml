"  The formation of Dickenson County in 1880 completed all the local organi=
zations authorized by the Virginia Assembly from Connecticut:--very brillia=
nt fine-grained micaceous iron, in large masses near Bellows' Falls; yellow=
 foliated blende, in Berlin, Connecticut, and near Hamilton College--the _
Indian scout, the Boone of Northwestern Virginia."  As if feeling this acti=
on a little unfair, the=20

Assembly next year, when a new county was to be created, named it Boone "in=
 honor to and in=20

memory of Daniel Boone the well known pioneer of the western frontier settl=
ements." Boone was=20

taken from parts of Kanawha, Cabell and Logan counties and lies south of Ch=
arleston, the state=20

capital.  In this same year, the county of Alexandria was added to Virginia=
's jurisdiction. The=20

Assembly enacted "That the territory comprising the county of Alexandria in=
 the District of=20

Columbia heretofore ceded by this commonwealth to the United States and by =
an act of congress=20

approved on the ninth day of July eighteen hundred and forty-six retroceded=
 to this=20

commonwealth, and by it accepted, is hereby declared to be an integral port=
ion of this=20

commonwealth and the citizens thereof are hereby declared to be subject to =
all the provisions, and=20

entitled to all the benefits, rights and privileges of the bill of rights a=
nd constitution of this=20

commonwealth."  In 1791, to aid in establishing the Federal City, as Washin=
gton was sometimes=20

called, Virginia gave to the United States certain land taken from Fairfax =
County to form a part of=20

the District of Columbia. In the Act quoted above it has been seen that the=
 United States=20

retroceded to Virginia that part of the District of Columbia which comprise=
d the county of=20

Alexandria. The name in 1920 was changed to Arlington.  Across the state fr=
om Alexandria the=20

new county of Highland came into being in 1847, being taken from parts of P=
endleton and Bath. Its=20

bounds are thus given: "Beginning where the North river gap road crosses th=
e Augusta county=20

line, and running thence to the top of Jackson's mountain so as to leave Ja=
cob Hiver's mansion=20

house in Pendleton county; thence to Andrew Fleisher's so as to include his=
 mansion house in the=20

new county; thence to the highlands between the Dry run and Crab bottom; an=
d thence along the=20

top of the High Knob; thence north sixty-five degrees west to Pocahontas co=
unty line; thence=20

along said county line to the plum orchard on the top of the Alleghany moun=
tains; thence to Adam=20

Stephenson's mansion house on Jackson's river in Bath county so as to inclu=
de Thomas=20

Campbell's mansion house on Back creek and also said Adam Stephenson's in t=
he new county;=20

thence to Andrew H. Byrd's mansion house on the Cow-pasture river so as to =
include the same=20

and that improvements and discoveries in the latter cannot fail of extendin=
g their beneficial effects=20

to the aforementioned employments. In fine, the study of mineralogy, whethe=
r it be viewed as=20

tending to increase individual wealth, to improve and multiply arts and man=
ufactures, and thus=20

promote the public good; or as affording a pleasant subject for scientific =
research, recommends=20

itself to the attention of the citizen and scholar."  This introductory vie=
w of the importance and=20

interest of the science cannot be charged with the fault of exaggeration, s=
ince it is most evident=20

that neither civilization, refinement in arts, nor comfort, can exist where=
 the properties of mineral=20

substances are but imperfectly understood.  As regards this country, the ar=
gument admits of much=20

amplification. The more our mineral treasures are explored, the more abunda=
ntly do they repay=20

the research; and we trust that the period is not far distant, when we shal=
l no longer ignorantly=20

tread under our feet minerals of great curiosity and value, and import from=
 other countries, at a=20

great expense, what we, in many instances, possess abundantly at home.[9]  =
But to return to the=20

plan of the author's work. Few persons, unacquainted with the science of mi=
neralogy, would=20

suspect that mere brute matter could exhibit many strong marks, capable of =
discrimination.  It=20

may, however, be confidently affirmed, that there is no mineral which, if c=
arefully studied, may not=20

be distinguished by characters sufficiently decisive from every other miner=
al; an account of these=20



characters ought, therefore, to precede every system of mineralogy. Profess=
or Cleaveland has,=20

with entire propriety, included them under the heads of crystallography, ph=
ysical and external=20

characters, and chemical characters.  He has given a clear view of the Abb=
=C3=A9 Ha=C3=BCy's curious=20

discoveries regarding the six primitive figures or solids which form the ba=
ses of all crystals--the=20

three integrant particles or molecules which constitute the primitive forms=
, and of the theory by=20

which it is shown how the immensely numerous and diversified secondary or a=
ctual forms arise=20

out of these few elementary figures.  This is certainly one of the most sin=
gular and acute=20

discoveries of our age. It is true, there is a difference of opinion among =
mineralogists as to the=20

practical use of crystallography in the discrimination of minerals. Some dw=
ell upon it with=20

excessive minuteness,=20


_
and so as to leave the dwelling house of William M'Clintick, jr. in Bath co=
unty; thence south sixty-

five degrees east to the Augusta county line and thence with said line to t=
he beginning."  The=20

name of the county is derived from its exceptionally high altitude, and the=
 name of its county seat,=20

Monterey, reflects the popular interest felt in the victory General Taylor =
had just won over the=20

Mexicans at the Battle of Monterey.  After the formation of Highland County=
 five counties destined=20

to lie in West Virginia were established. The first of these, Hancock, crea=
ted in 1848 out of Brooke,=20

lies in the extreme northern tip of the present state between the Ohio rive=
r and the Pennsylvania=20

state line. Its name honors the first Signer of the Declaration of Independ=
ence, whose=20

distinguished signature is familiar through countless reproductions.  In th=
is same year from=20

portions of Jackson and Wood counties was formed Wirt. This is in the north=
western area of the=20

state not far from Parkersburg. In the description of bounds, only three la=
nd owners are named,=20

John Stephens, junior, John P. Thomasson and William Goff.  The name of the=
 county honored=20

the distinguished lawyer, William Wirt, who had died a few years before. He=
 had served as=20

Attorney General of the United States from 1817 to 1829 and had been a cand=
idate for the=20

Presidency on the Anti-Masonic ticket in 1832. He is best remembered for hi=
s life of Patrick Henry.=20

The third county created in 1848 was Putnam, composed of parts of Kanawha, =
Cabell and Mason=20

counties, and lying to the west of the city of Charleston. Its name recalls=
 a hero of the=20

Revolutionary War, General Israel Putnam who distinguished himself at the B=
attle of Bunker Hill=20

and became a popular hero.   1850-1860 EBBING TIDE, TWELVE COUNTIES  The ye=
ar 1850=20

saw the formation of two more counties now in West Virginia. The first one,=
 Raleigh, was taken=20

from the southern part of Fayette. In its bounds, the lands of Isaac Sonner=
s and Jackson Jarrell,=20

and the New, Coal, and Guyandotte rivers are noted. The name was "in memory=
 of Sir Walter=20

Raleigh who made the earliest effort to colonize Virginia." It is pleasant =
to see that Virginia finally=20

recognized her debt to this valiant soul, even though it was tardily done, =
for he died in 1618.  A few=20

days after Raleigh became a county, the Virginia Assembly enacted that the =
county of Wyoming=20

be erected out of the county of Logan. Wyoming lies in the southern central=
 portion of West=20

Virginia. The reason for the name is obscure, whether it was for the beauti=
ful Wyoming Valley in=20

north central Pennsylvania watered by the Susquehanna River, or for the bru=
tal massacre of its=20

inhabitants on 4 July 1778 by a British and Indian force is unknown.  Half =
of the nineteenth century=20

has passed and our narrative has only a few more years to chronicle. In 185=
1, three counties were=20

formed. One of these, Craig, remained in Virginia. It was taken from parts =
of Botetourt, Roanoke,=20

Giles and Monroe.  Its bounds were as follows: "Beginning on the top of the=
 Middle mountain at=20

the corner of Monroe and Alleghany counties, near Achilles Dews, and runnin=
g with the Alleghany=20

line to the top of Peters' mountain; thence westward along the top of said =
mountain to a point=20

nearby opposite to the house of Boston Rowan; thence crossing Potts' creek =
to a point one fourth=20

of a mile below said Rowan's so as to leave said Rowan's in the county of M=
onroe; thence a=20

southwestern direction to the top of Potts' mountain, so as to leave Arment=
rout, Fridley and Rose=20

in Monroe; thence westward along the top of said mountain to a point opposi=
te Colonel R. M.=20

Hutchinson's on John's creek, and thence a straight line including said Hut=
chinson in the new=20

county, and crossing Sinking creek valley to William Niday's, including sai=
d Niday in the new=20

county, to the Montgomery line; thence eastward with the Montgomery line to=
 the corner of=20

Roanoke and Montgomery; thence with the Roanoke line to the top of Brush mo=
untain; thence=20



eastward along said mountain, crossing the Cove branch where John Carper fo=
rmerly lived;=20

thence along the same range of mountains passing near Lilburn Doss's, cross=
ing Stone Coal gap;=20

thence along the same range of mountains, crossing Price's turnpike road to=
 a point opposite=20

Daniel Sizer's; thence a northwestern direction crossing Craig's creek abov=
e said Sizer's to a point=20

one mile from Craig's creek on the ridge; thence to Andrew Persinger's on B=
arber's creek; thence=20

to the Alleghany line and with the same to the beginning."  The name of the=
 county honored=20

Robert Craig, member of Congress from Virginia 1829-1834, 1835-1841.  In th=
e same month in=20

which Craig was set up, the new county of Upshur was created from parts of =
Randolph, Barbour=20

and Lewis, all now in West Virginia. The starting point in the description =
of its bounds reads as=20

follows: "Beginning at a rock or milestone on the Staunton and Parkersburg =
turnpike road ten=20

miles east of Weston in Lewis County." This shows that transportation had d=
eveloped sufficiently=20

to connect places on the Ohio River with other sections of Virginia.  Upshu=
r County took its name=20

from Abel P. Upshur whom President Tyler appointed Secretary of State to su=
cceed Daniel=20

Webster. Upshur was killed 28 February 1844 by the explosion of a new type =
of cannon which was=20

being tested on the U.S.S. _Princeton_.  Also in March 1851, from the count=
ies of Tyler, Wood=20

and Ritchie the new county of Pleasants was established. This lies in the a=
rea around Parkersburg=20

in the northwestern part of West Virginia, along the Ohio River. The name h=
onored the memory of=20

James Pleasants, Governor of Virginia, 1822 to 1825, member of a family lon=
g resident and=20

prominent in the state.  Five years passed and in the interval population h=
ad increased to such an=20

extent in the western part of Virginia that four county governments had to =
be set up to take care of=20

legal needs. One of these, Wise, formed from portions of Lee, Scott and Rus=
sell counties, remains=20

in Virginia. The name honored Henry A. Wise, Governor of Virginia 1856-1860=
.  The bounds of the=20

county were as follows: "Beginning at the break of Cumberland mountain on t=
he Kentucky and=20

Virginia line where the Pound fork of Sandy breaks through the Cumberland m=
ountain; thence up=20

the Pound fork to the mouth of Crane's nest, a water of said Pound fork; th=
ence with the dividing=20

ridge between the waters of Crane's nest and McLure's, to William Taylor's =
farm, including said=20

Taylor's farm in the new county; thence a straight line to the mouth of Lic=
k creek; thence down=20

Clinch river to the mouth of Guest's river; thence up Guest's river one mil=
e; thence a straight line to=20

the Camp rock south of the High Knob; thence a straight line to the Pole fe=
nce on Little Powell's=20

mountain, on the line dividing Scott and Lee counties; thence with said cou=
nty line to the head of=20

Stock creek including the farm of Zachariah N. Wells in the said county; th=
ence a straight line to=20

the Cedar gap near Powell's river; thence a straight line to the dividing r=
idge between the waters of=20

Crab orchard and Pigeon fork; thence with said dividing ridge to the Kentuc=
ky line and thence with=20

the Kentucky line to the beginning."  In the Act creating the county it was=
 ordered that the "said=20

seat of justice shall be known as The truth seems to be, that those who und=
erstand it, derive from=20

it (wherever it is applicable) the most satisfactory aid; and it requires o=
nly a moderate knowledge=20

of geometry to understand its principal outlines. On the other hand, it is =
no doubt possible, in most=20

instances, to dispense with its aid, and to discriminate minerals by their =
other properties.  Of the=20

external and physical characters of Mr. Werner, Mr. Cleaveland has given a =
clear account,=20

combining into the same view the fine discriminations of the French authors=
, particularly regarding=20

refraction, phosphorescence, specific gravity, electricity, chatoyement, an=
d magnetism. The same=20

may be said of the chemical characters. We do not know a more satisfactory =
and able view of the=20



characters of minerals than Professor Cleaveland has exhibited.  We would h=
owever ask, whether,=20

in enumerating the kinds of lustre, the term _adamantine_ should not be exp=
lained, as it is not=20

understood by people in general, while the terms denoting the other kinds a=
re _generally_=20

intelligible; whether in the enumeration of imitative forms, _lenticular_ a=
nd _acicular_ should not=20

rather be referred to the laws of crystallization; whether _reniform_ and _=
mamillary_ are=20

synonymous; whether _sandstone_, as being a mere aggregate of _fragments_, =
is a good=20

instance of the _granular_ fracture; whether in its natural state (at least=
 the common ore of nickel)=20

is _ever_ magnetic, till _purified_, and whether cobalt is _ever_ magnetic =
unless _impure_.=20

Professor Cleaveland's remarks on _fracture_ are uncommonly discriminating =
and instructive, and=20

would lead a learner to a just comprehension of this important point in the=
 characters of minerals.=20

The section relating to the _chemical characters_ is concise, and professed=
ly proceeds upon the=20

principle of selection. It might perhaps have been, to some extent, advanta=
geously enlarged;=20

although, it is true, the author refers us to the particular minerals for i=
ndividual instances; still it=20

might have been well to have illustrated the general principles by a few we=
ll-chosen instances, _e.=20

g._ how, by the blowpipe, _galena_ is distinguished from _sulphuret of anti=
mony_; _carbonat of=20

lead_ from _sulphat of barytes_, or _carbonat of lime_; _garnet_ from _tita=
nium_; _plaster of=20

Paris_ from _soapstone_, &c.; and, among trials in the moist way, how by ni=
tric acid and=20

ammonia, _iron pyrites_ is distinguished from _copper pyrites_; and how, by=
 acids, _sulphat of=20

lime_ is known from _carbonat of lime_. As the acids are used principally f=
or trials on the=20

effervescence of carbonats, most of which form with sulphuric acid, insolub=
le compounds, we=20

should doubt whether sulphuric acid is so advantageously employed as the ni=
tric or muriatic, in=20

such cases, on account of the clogging of the effervescence by the thick ma=
gena, produced by a=20

recently precipitated and insoluble sulphat.  According to our experience, =
the nitric or muriatic acid,=20

diluted with two or three parts of water, is most eligible.  With respect t=
o the blowpipe: it is _a=20

convenience_ to have a mouth-piece of wood, or ivory, joined to a tube of m=
etal, as Mr.=20

Cleaveland recommends; and some authors direct to have the tube attached to=
 a hollow ball, for=20

the sake of condensing the moisture of the breath; but every thing which ad=
ds to the expense and=20

complication of the instrument will tend to discourage its use; we have nev=
er found any difficulty in=20

performing every important experiment with the common goldsmith's brass blo=
wpipe; and are=20

confident, that, after the learner has acquired the art, or _knack_, of pro=
pelling a continued stream=20

of air from his mouth, by means of the muscles of the lips and cheeks, whil=
e his respiration=20

proceeds without embarrassment through the nostrils, he will need no other =
instrument than the=20

common blowpipe. Indeed it is a truly admirable instrument, instantly givin=
g us the effect of very=20

powerful furnaces, the heat being entirely under command, the subject of op=
eration and all the=20

changes in full view, and the expense and bulk of the instrument being such=
 that every one may=20

possess it, and carry it about his person.  The chapter on the principles o=
f arrangement is worthy=20

of all praise. This difficult subject is here discussed with such clearness=
, comprehensiveness, and=20

candour, as prove the author to be completely master of his subject; and we=
 are persuaded, that,=20

on this topic, no author can be studied with more advantage. We forbear to =
extract, because the=20

whole should be attentively perused in connexion, and scarcely admits of ab=
ridgement. We=20

entirely agree with Professor Cleaveland, as we have already said, that the=
 chemical composition=20

of minerals is the only just foundation of their arrangement; that next in =
importance is the=20



crystalline structure, including a knowledge of the primitive form, and int=
egrant molecule; and last=20

and least important, _in fixing the arrangement_, are the external characte=
rs: these last should be=20

only provisionally employed, where the two first are not ascertained, or th=
e second is not=20

applicable. When the arrangement is once made, we _may_, however, and we co=
mmonly _shall_,=20

in _describing_ minerals, pursue precisely the reverse order; the external =
characters will usually=20

be mentioned first, the crystalline characters next, and the chemical last =
of all. In description, the=20

external characters are often the most valuable; if judiciously selected an=
d arranged, they will=20

always prove of the most essential service, and can rarely be entirely disp=
ensed with.  With regard=20

to the NOMENCLATURE of minerals, we feelingly unite with Professor Cleavela=
nd in deploring the=20

oppressive redundancy of synonymes. Few minerals have only one name, and us=
ually they have=20

several. With Count Bournon we agree, that the discoverer of a mineral has =
the exclusive right of=20

naming it, and that the name once given should not be changed without the m=
ost cogent reasons.=20

What then shall we say of the ABB=C3=89 HA=C3=9CY, of whom, whether we spea=
k of his genius, his=20

learning, his acuteness, his discoveries, his candour, and love of truth, o=
r his universally amiable=20

and venerable character, we can never think without sentiments of the highe=
st respect and=20

admiration? More than any modern writer he has added to the list of synonym=
es, often exchanging=20

a very good name, derived perhaps from the locality or discoverer of a mine=
ral, for one=20

professedly significant, but connected with its subject by a chain of thoug=
ht so slight, that=20

considerable knowledge of Greek etymology, and still more explanation, is n=
ecessary to=20

comprehend the connexion; and thus, after all, it amounts, with respect to =
most readers, only to=20

the exchange of one arbitrary name for another. What advantage, for instanc=
e, has _grammatite_,=20

alluding to a line often obscure, and still oftener wholly invisible, over =
the good old name=20

_tremolite_, which always reminds us of an interesting locality; how is _py=
roxene_ better than=20

_augite_, _amphibole_ than _hornblende_, _amphigene_ than _leucite_, or _di=
sthene_ than=20

_sappar_. Some of the Abb=C3=A9 Ha=C3=BCy's names are, however, very happil=
y chosen, especially where=20

new discriminations were to be established, or errors corrected, or even a =
redundant crop of=20

synonymes to be superseded by a better name. _Epidote_ is an=20


_
called Wise.  As has been said, Wise was the only one of the four counties =
erected in 1856 that=20

remains in Virginia. The next county formed was Calhoun taken from the lowe=
r portion of Gilmer=20

County beginning at the West Fork of the Little Kanawha River. The name der=
ives from the great=20

South Carolina statesman who succeeded Abel P. Upshur as Secretary of State=
 and was long=20

outstanding in politics.  At the same time that Calhoun became an entity, p=
arts of the counties of=20

Kanawha, Jackson, and Gilmer lying a little _zeolite family_ into four spec=
ies, _mesotype_,=20

_stilbite_, _analcime_, and _chabasie_, afford a happy instance of the form=
er. It were much to be=20

wished, that by the common consent of mineralogists, one nomenclature shoul=
d be universally=20

adopted: for its uniformity is of much more importance than its nature.  In=
 expressing our=20

approbation of the principles of arrangement adopted by Professor Cleavelan=
d, we have of course=20

espoused those of his TABULAR VIEW, which is perhaps as nearly as the state=
 of science will=20


_
became Roane County. The description of its bounds is startling when it men=
tions "the=20

Ravenswood and California turnpike in Jackson county," but later we learn t=
hat California is a town=20

in Jackson County.  With regard to Roane County, "its name and that of its =
seat of justice,=20

Spencer, commemorate that of him [Spencer Roane] whose life and public serv=
ices added lustre=20

to the annals of Virginia jurisprudence." Spencer Roane was "judge of the S=
upreme Bench 1794 to=20

1822."  The next county was Tucker formed out of the northeastern portion o=
f Randolph County=20

and adjoining also the counties of Hardy, Preston and Pendleton. The county=
 seat appropriately=20

bore the name of Saint George. The county was "named in honor of Saint Geor=
ge Tucker the=20

eminent Virginia jurist while the seat of justice derives its name from Sai=
nt George Tucker who=20

was Clerk of the House of Delegates at the time the county was formed."  Tw=
o years later in 1858,=20

three more counties were established, one of which, Buchanan, was destined =
to remain in=20

Virginia, and the other two in West Virginia.  McDowell, one of the two, wa=
s taken from the=20

northwest portion of Tazewell County and remains a border county between th=
e two states, "The=20

ridge between Abb's Valley and Sandy" is one of the bounding lines noted in=
 the description; it=20

recalls the Indian Massacre that occurred in that Valley and the many stori=
es related about it.  The=20

name of the county honors James McDowell, elected Governor of Virginia in 1=
843 and serving=20

until 1846.  Clay County formed also in 1858 was created out of the souther=
n part of Braxton=20

County and the northern part of Nicholas. Among the property owners whose l=
ands were=20

mentioned as within its bounds, were Thomas Jarvis, jr., James Rogers, Char=
les Ruffner, who with=20

others owned a twelve thousand acre tract "(near the farm of William Nichol=
, Sr.)," Strother B.=20

Grose and Abraham Dilly.  The county was so named in honor of Henry Clay, t=
he great Kentucky=20

statesman who had died only a few years before its formation.  The Virginia=
 county established in=20

1858 from parts of Tazewell and Russell was Buchanan, named for James Bucha=
nan, President=20

of the United States 1857-1861.  Its bounds were as follows: "Beginning at =
the state line between=20

Kentucky and Virginia and with said line to its intersection with the line =
of Wise county, to the top=20

of the dividing ridge between the waters of Sandy and Clinch and with said =
ridge eastwardly to the=20

head of Dismal, a branch of the Lavica fork of Sandy river; then with the d=
ividing ridge between the=20

waters of Dismal and the waters of the Dry fork of Sandy and with the ridge=
 between the waters of=20

the Lavica fork and the Dry fork to the ridge between Knox creek and Bull c=
reek to Tug river and=20

down Tug river to the beginning."   1860-1870 RECESSION, TWO COUNTIES  In 1=
860, an Act=20

was passed to create the new county of Webster from portions of the countie=
s of Nicholas,=20

Braxton and Randolph, all to be later in West Virginia. The name honored Da=
niel Webster, the=20

prominent statesman who had died only a few years previously.  In March 186=
1, the new county of=20

Bland, taken from portions of Giles, Wythe and Tazewell and named for Richa=
rd Bland of=20

Revolutionary War fame came into being. Its bounds are thus set forth: "beg=
inning at the top of=20

Walker's Little mountain at the line between Wythe and Pulaski and running =
northwards with said=20

line of Pulaski, to the top of Walker's Big mountain; thence eastward along=
 the top of said last=20

mentioned mountain to a point opposite the mouth of Kimberling creek; thenc=
e by a line northward=20

passing through the mouth of said Kimberling creek to a point on the top of=
 the mountain which=20

lies south of Wolf creek, three miles east of the present county line betwe=
en Giles and Tazewell=20

counties; thence to a point on the top of East river mountain two miles eas=
t of the present county=20

line between Giles and Tazewell so as to include the homestead of Madison A=
llen and his lands=20



adjoining thereto; thence with the top of the said East River mountain west=
ward to a point two=20

miles west of George Steel's house on Clear fork; thence across and by a li=
ne as near as may be=20

at right angles to the course of the valley between to the top of Rich moun=
tain and westward along=20

the top of said Rich mountain so far as to include the settlement of Wolf c=
reek, thence across the=20

top of Garden mountain; thence along the top of Garden mountain to a point =
through which the=20

line between Wythe and Smyth would pass if prolonged; thence by said prolon=
ged line to the said=20

line between Wythe and Smyth and by the last mentioned line to the top of W=
alker's Big mountain;=20

thence eastward with the top of said Walker's Big mountain to a point oppos=
ite the headwaters of=20

Walker's Little creek; thence across to the top of Walker's Little mountain=
, thence to the top of=20

Brongniart, to which it bears a close resemblance. Some of the subordinate =
parts, we could have=20

wished had been arranged in a manner somewhat different. In the genus lime,=
 it appears to us=20

better to describe the species carbonat first; because, being very abundant=
, and its characters=20

clear, it forms a convenient point of departure and standard of comparison,=
 in describing the other=20

species which have lime for their basis, and some of which are comparativel=
y rare. The same=20

remark we would make upon quartz, and its concomitant, pure silicious stone=
s. There appears to=20

us a high advantage in making these minerals clearly known first, before we=
 proceed to those=20

which are much more rare, and especially which are much harder, and possess=
 the characters of=20

gems. For example, if a learner has become acquainted with quartz, chalcedo=
ny, flint, opal,=20

chrysoprase, and jasper, he will much more easily comprehend the superior h=
ardness, &c. and=20

different composition of topaz, sapphire, spinelleruby, chrysoberyl, and zi=
rcon, which we should=20

much prefer to see occupying a later, than the first place in a tabular arr=
angement; and, although=20

topaz, by containing fluoric acid, appears to be in some measure assimilate=
d to saline minerals, it=20

is in its characters so very diverse from the earthy salts, that we have fa=
ir reason to conclude that=20

the fluoric acid does not stamp the character; and, as it bears so close a =
resemblance to the ruby=20

and sapphire, which evidently derive their principal characters from the ar=
gillaceous earth, we=20

perhaps ought to infer that this (the topaz,) does so too. Indeed Professor=
 Cleaveland has=20

sufficiently implied his own opinion, by giving these minerals a juxtaposit=
ion in his table, although=20

the same reasons which induced the placing of the topaz next to the earthy =
salts, could not have=20

justified the placing of the sapphire there. On these points we are not, ho=
wever, strenuous; they=20

are of more importance if the work be used as a text-book for lectures, tha=
n as a private=20

companion. With respect to the _completeness_ of Professor Cleaveland's tab=
ular view, we have=20

carefully compared it with the third edition of Jameson's mineralogy; and a=
lthough a few new=20

species, or sub-species, and varieties have been added in this last edition=
, they are in general of=20

so little importance, that Professor Cleaveland's work cannot be considered=
 as materially deficient;=20

and the few cases in which it is so, are much more than made up by his enti=
rely new and=20

instructive views of American mineralogy, to which no parallel is to be fou=
nd in any other book,=20

and which give it peculiar interest to the American, and even to the Europe=
an, reader.  In another=20

edition, (which we cannot doubt will speedily be called for,) he will of co=
urse add whatever is=20

omitted in this, and we should be gratified to see a good article on the su=
bject of the =C3=A6rolites or=20

stones which have fallen from the atmosphere. This subject is one, in our v=
iew, of high interest;=20

and although _in strictness_ it may not claim a place in a tabular view of =
minerals, (we must=20

confess, however, that we see no important obstacle to its being treated of=
 under the head of=20



native iron,) there can be no objection to its being placed in an appendix.=
 The fall of stones from=20

the atmosphere is the most curious and mysterious fact in natural history. =
 It may seem perhaps=20

too trivial to remark, that the annexation of numbers, referring to the pag=
es, would be a serious=20

addition to the utility of the tabular view. Very few inadvertencies have b=
een observed--the=20

following may be mentioned: _Amenia_, in the State of New-York, is printed =
(by a typographical=20

error we presume) Armenia; and _Menechan_, where the menechanite is found, =
is mentioned as=20

occurring in Scotland, but it is in Cornwall.  Authors seem agreed that the=
 black-lead ore is an=20

altered carbonat, but they seem not to have been so well agreed as to the n=
ature of the blue-lead=20

ore. In the cabinet of Colonel Gibbs, there are specimens which appear sati=
sfactorily to illustrate=20

both these subjects. The black-lead is by the blowpipe alone reducible to m=
etallic lead; there is=20

one specimen in the cabinet referred to, which is blackened on what appears=
 to have been the=20

under side, and seemingly by the contact of sulphuretted hydrogen gas; that=
 which was probably=20

the upper part remains unaltered, and is beautiful white carbonat of lead; =
this appearance is the=20

more striking, because the piece is large and full of interstices, by which=
 the gas appears to have=20

passed through. The blue ore is in large six-sided prisms of a dark blue or=
 almost black colour;=20

where the prisms are broken across, they present an unequal appearance; som=
etimes they are=20

_invested_; and sometimes slightly, and at other times deeply, _penetrated_=
 by sulphuret of lead,=20

having the usual brilliant foliated=20


_
Hardly was the ink dry on the Act quoted above when war precluded further s=
ettlements and=20

expansion. Not for nearly twenty years would another and the last county be=
 established.   FINIS--

ONE COUNTY  In March 1880, out of the counties of Russell, Wise, and Buchan=
an was formed=20

the new county of Dickenson, named for a prominent member of the Readjuster=
 Party, then=20

dominant in Virginia.  Its bounds noted in great detail are as follows: "be=
ginning at Osborn's gap in=20

Cumberland mountain on the state line; thence a straight line to the top of=
 George's Fork mountain=20

at a point where the road crosses said mountain; thence with the top of the=
 mountain to the head=20

of Lick branch, a tributary of Crane's nest creek; thence a straight line t=
o the mouth of Birchfield=20

creek; thence up Crane's Nest creek to the sulphuret of lead is easily redu=
cible by the blowpipe,=20

but not the whole crystal, as authors appear to imply; for if that part of =
the crystal which does not=20

present the appearance of galena is heated by the blowpipe flame, it is not=
 reduced, but congeals=20

into the garnet dodecahedron, with its colour unaltered: these crystals are=
 therefore phosphat of=20

lead, and they appear to be either an original mixture of phosphat and sulp=
huret of lead, or the=20

phosphat has somehow in part given up its phosphoric acid, and assumed in i=
ts stead sulphur,=20

perhaps from the decomposition of sulphuretted hydrogen.  Professor Cleavel=
and will, of course,=20

add new localities, even foreign ones, where they are interesting, and dome=
stic ones, where they=20

are well authenticated. Among the former, we trust he will mention the=20


_
Lion's fork; thence up said creek to the forks of said branch; thence up th=
e Fork spur to the top of=20

Crane's Nest bridge; thence a straight line to Sandy Ridge meeting-house in=
 the county of Wise on=20

the top of Sandy Ridge; thence with the top of Sandy ridge to the James Por=
ter farm at the head of=20

Nancy's ridge; thence a straight line to Trammel gap on Sandy ridge, thence=
 with the top of Sandy=20

ridge with a line of Russell county to the James P. Kiser farm, thence a st=
raight line to Henry=20

Kiser's farm on the top of Sandy ridge at the Russell county line; thence w=
ith the Russell county=20

line to James Rasnaker's farm, including said farm in the new county; thenc=
e down the Cany ridge=20

to the mouth of Cany creek; thence down Indian creek to its mouth; includin=
g J. H. Duly's farm;=20

thence down Russell's fork of Sandy river Mount Idienne, in the Province of=
 Bagnia Vangni, in the=20

eastern part of Java, and also the river of sulphuric acid which flows from=
 it and kills animals,=20

scorches vegetation, and corrodes the stones.[10] Among American localities=
, we beg leave to=20

mention violet fluor spar, abundant and very handsome, near Shawnee Town, o=
n the Ohio, in the=20

Illinois Territory, and galena, of which this fluor is the gangue;--sulphat=
 of magnesia, perfectly=20

crystallized, in masses composed of delicate white prisms, in a cave in the=
 Indiana Territory, not=20

very remote from Louisville, in Kentucky; it is said to be so abundant that=
 the inhabitants carry it=20

away by the wagon load;--pulverulent carbonat of magnesia, apparently pure,=
 found by Mr. Pierce=20

at Hoboken, in serpentine, where the hydrate of magnesia was found;--chabas=
ie, agates,=20


_
Panpan creek, including Andrew Owen's dwelling house; thence a straight lin=
e to the mouth of=20

Greenbrier creek, a tributary of Prater creek; thence a straight line to th=
e Big meadow gap; thence=20

down a branch to Gressy creek; thence down said creek to the mouth of Russe=
ll's fork of Sandy=20

river; thence down said river to the analcime, at Deerfield, by Mr. E. Hitc=
hcock;--agates in=20

abundance at East-Haven, near New-Haven, in secondary greenstone, like the =
above-named=20

minerals at Deerfield;--saline springs, covered with petroleum, and emittin=
