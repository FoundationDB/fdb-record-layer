dracaena marginata  George remained in Pennsylvania and other states farthe=

n 1893. He came direct from Altoona, Pennsylvania, with a white man whose n=

his is in the country, among the shepherds and ploughmen. In the cities lab=
our has congregated numbers, mutual intelligence, union on its side; it is =
constantly _
in Florida. It is plentiful in certain parts of Palatka, Florida.  Riding v=
ehicles in early days were=20

called buggies. The first one George remembers was the go cart. It had two =
wheels and was=20

without a top. Only two people could ride in a go cart. The equilibrium was=
 kept by buckling the=20

harness over and under the horse's belly. The strap which ran under the bel=
ly was called the belly=20

girt. There was a side strap which ran along the horse's side and the belly=
 girt was fastened to=20

this. Loops were put to vantage points on the side strap and through these =
the shafts of the cart=20

were run. The strap going under and over the horse kept the cart from going=
 too far forward or=20

backward.  During George's early life plows looked very much like they do t=
oday. They had=20

wooden handles but the part which turned the ground was made of point iron,=
 (he could not=20

describe point iron.) Plows were not made of cast iron or steel as they are=
 today.  Two kinds of=20

plows were used so far as George remembers. One was called the skooter plow=
 and the other the=20

turn plow. The skooter plow he describes as one which broke the ground up w=
hich had been=20

previously planted. When the earth needed loosening up to make more fit for=
 planting, this plow=20

was used over the earth, leaving it rather smooth and light. The turn plow =
was used to turn the=20

ground completely over. Where grass and weeds had grown, the earth needed t=
urning over so as=20

to thoroughly uproot the weeds and grass. The ground was usually left a whi=
le so that the weeds=20

could die and rot and then men destructive process had its limit, and that =
adamant was still=20

beneath their feet. But a world which is intellectual and keenly alive to t=
he significance of these=20

questions, reading all that is written about them with almost passionate av=
idity, finds itself brought=20

to a crisis the character of which any one may realize by distinctly presen=
ting to himself the idea of=20

existence without a God.     THE LABOUR MOVEMENT  _(This Lecture was delive=
red before the=20

Mechanics' Institute of Montreal, and the Literary Society of Sherbrooke, a=
nd published in the=20

CANADIAN MONTHLY, December, 1872. The allusions to facts and events must be=
 read with=20

reference to the date.)_   We are in the midst of an industrial war which i=
s extending over Europe=20

and the United States, and has not left Canada untouched. It is not wonderf=
ul that great alarm=20

should prevail, or that, in panic-stricken minds, it should assume extravag=
ant forms. London=20

deprived of bread by a bakers' strike, or of fuel by a colliers' strike, is=
 a serious prospect; so is the=20

sudden stoppage of any one of the wheels in the vast and complicated machin=
e of modern=20

industry. People may be pardoned for thinking that they have fallen on evil=
 times, and that they=20

have a dark future before them. Yet, those who have studied industrial hist=
ory know that the=20

present disturbance is mild compared with the annals of even a not very rem=
ote past. The study of=20

history shows us where we are, and whither things are tending. Though it do=
es not diminish the=20

difficulties of the present hour, it teaches us=20

go over the ground and make it ready for planting.  When freedom came to Ne=
groes in the slave=20

territory, George remembers that Sherman's army drilled a long time after t=
he Civil War had=20

ended. He saw them right in Pennsylvania. He was much impressed with their =
blue suits and=20

brass buttons and which fitted them so well. Some of the men wore suits wit=
h braid on them and=20

they supposedly were the officers of the outfit. Negro and white men were i=
n the same companies=20

he saw and all were manly and walking proudly.  As George was fifteen years=
 of age when=20

freedom came much of which he related happened after Emancipation. He being=
 out of the them=20

 left without hot=20

bread.  One of the literary janissaries of the French Empire thought to pro=
ve that the working class=20

had no rights against the Bonapartes, by showing that the first free labour=
ers were only=20

emancipated slaves. One would like to know what he supposed the first Bonap=
artes were.=20

However though his inference was not worth much, except against those who a=
re pedantic=20

enough, to vouch parchment archives for the rights and interests of humanit=
y, he was in the right=20

as to the fact. Labour first appears in history as a slave, treated like a =

did not have as much contact with the slaves, but he lived around his grand=
 parents who had been=20

slaves in the southern part of the state. After slavery they moved up to Al=
toona, with George's=20

parents and brought much in the way of customs to George.  Grandfather McCo=
y and also=20

 (ergastula) on his=20

eemed to have left a=20

sad memory with George.  Isaac Pretty's family was large. He had seven girl=
s and seven boys,=20

George being the eldest. George remembers how his heart would ache when his=
 grandfather told=20

of the children who were torn from their mother's skirts and sold, never to=
 see their parents again.=20

He went into deep thought over how he would have hated to have been separat=
ed from his mother=20

and father to say nothing of leaving his brothers and sisters. They were br=
ought up to love each=20

other and the thought of breaking the family ties seemed to him very Roman =

"Why, what has the slave done?" asks her husband.  One day labour strikes; =
finds a leader in=20

Spartacus, a slave devoted as a gladiator to the vilest of Roman pleasures;=
 wages a long and=20

terrible servile war. The revolt is put down at last, after shaking the fou=
ndations of the state. Six=20

thousand slaves are crucified along the road from Rome to Capua. Labour had=
 its revenge, for=20

slavery brought the doom of Rome.  In the twilight of history, between the =
fall of Rome and the rise=20

of the new nationalities, we dimly see the struggle going on. There is a gr=

When George was told that he was grown as formerly related, he saved his mo=
ney and when the=20

great earth quake in Charleston occured he went down there to see what it h=
ad done to the place.=20

Before that time in 1882 he remembered having seen the first block of ice. =
When he got there, the=20
