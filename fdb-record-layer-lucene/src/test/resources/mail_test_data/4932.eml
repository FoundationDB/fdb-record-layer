philodendron monstera affairs, not at all after the manner of the usual pig, but more like a village gossip who wants to know about everything that is going on in the neighborhood.  In the gradual development of "Jeff's" character, it was discovered that house-furnishing was an easy-chair.  "Harry," said his wife, "don't you think you'd better sit down?"  The calm voice of common sense stopped him in his circular tour.

this particular species of the porcine tribe is unknown, but there is a tradition to the effect that their 

progenitors were a part of the drove that came to the coast of Florida with De Soto when he 

started on the march which ended with the discovery of the Mississippi River. History records the 

fact that a large number of animals were brought from Spain for food, and that a considerable 

number of them succeeded in getting away from the expedition soon after the landing was 

effected.  Our particular specimen of this wandering tribe of natural marauders was captured by a 

boat's crew of the _Louisiana_ in one of the swamps adjacent to Currituck Sound when he was a 

wee bit of an orphaned waif, not much larger than an ostrich egg.  He was an ill-conditioned little 

mite that had probably been abandoned by a heartless mother, possibly while escaping from the 

prospective mess-kettle of a Confederate picket.  In those days Confederate pickets were not very 

particular as to the quality or kind of food, and I have a suspicion that even a "Razor Back" would 

have been a welcome addition to their meal.  When "Jeff" was brought on board, his pitiful 

condition excited the active sympathy of all, from the commander down to the smallest powder 

monkey, and numerous were the suggestions made as to the course of treatment for the new 

patient. The doctor was consulted, and after a careful diagnosis, decided there was no organic 

disease: want of parental care, want of nourishment and exposure, were held responsible for 

"Jeff's" unfavorable condition. It was decided to put him on a light diet of milk, which proved an 

immediate success, for, within forty-eight hours after his first meal, the patient became as lively as 

possible. As days and weeks went on, there appeared an improvement of appetite that was quite 

phenomenal, but no accumulation of flesh. His legs and body grew longer; and, with this 

lengthening of parts, there came a development of intellectual acuteness that was particularly 

surprising. He attached himself to each individual of the ship. He had no favorites, but was hail-

fellow-well-met with all. He developed all the playful qualities of a puppy and reasoned out a 

number of problems in his own way. His particular admirers declared that he learned the meaning 

of the different whistles of the boatswain: that he knew when to paint a bad picture as to be a 

valet. He could not sentimentalize the tones, nor falsify the values. He simply could not; the 

attempt to do so annoyed him. All men are capable of stooping beneath their highest selves, and 

in several directions Priam Farll could have stooped. But not on canvas! He could only produce his 

best. He could only render nature as he saw nature. And it was instinct, rather than conscience, 

that prevented him from stooping.  In three days, during which he kept Alice out of the attic partly 

by lies and partly by locking the door, the picture was finished; and he had forgotten all about 

everything except his profession. He had become a different man, a very excited man.  "By Jove," 

he exclaimed, surveying the picture, "I can paint!"  Artists do occasionally soliloquize in this way. 

The picture was dazzling! What atmosphere! What poetry! And what profound fidelity to nature's 

facts! It was precisely such a picture as he was in the habit of selling for L800 or a L1,000, before 

his burial in Westminster Abbey! Indeed, the trouble was that it had 'Priam Farll' written all over it, 

just as the sketch had!         *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER VII   _The Confession_   That 

evening he was very excited, and he seemed to take no thought to disguise his excitement. The 

fact was, he could not have disguised it, even if he had tried. The fever of artistic creation was 

upon him--all the old desires and the old exhausting joys. His genius had been lying idle, like a lion 

in a thicket, and now it had sprung forth ravening. For months he had not handled a brush; for 

months his mind had deliberately avoided the question of painting, being content with the 



observation only of beauty. A week ago, if he had deliberately asked himself whether he would 

ever paint again, he might have answered, "Perhaps not." Such is man's ignorance of his own 

nature! And now the lion of his genius was standing over him, its paw on his breast, and making a 

great noise.  He saw that the last few months had been merely an interlude, that he would be 

forced to paint--or go mad; and that nothing else mattered. He saw also that he could only paint in 

one way--Priam Farll's way. If it was discovered that Priam Farll was not buried in Westminster 

Abbey; if there was a scandal, and legal unpleasantness--well, so much

peak; could tell when the crew was beat to quarters for drill, and often proved the correctness of 

this knowledge by scampering off to take his place by one particular gun division, which seemed to 

have taken his fancy.  I can testify personally to only one item in the schedule of his intellectual 

achievements. It is a custom But he must paint.  Not for money, mind you! Incidentally, of course, 

he would earn money. But he had already quite forgotten that life has its financial aspect.  So in 

the sitting-room in Werter Road, he walked uneasily to and fro, squeezing between the table and 

the sideboard, and then skirting the fireplace where Alice sat

commander of a ship to receive any officer of rank of either branch of the service at the gangway 

of the ship. In this act of courtesy he is always accompanied by the officer of the deck, and often 

by others that may happen to be at hand. After the advent of "Jeff," whenever I went on board the 

_Louisiana,_ he was always at the gangway, and seemingly was deeply interested in the event. It 

may be said of him, generally, that he was overflowing with spirits, and took an active interest in all 

the daily routine work of his ship.  He had a most pertinacious way of her spectacles on--she wore 

spectacles when she had to look fixedly at very dark objects. The room was ugly in a pleasant 

Putneyish way, with a couple of engravings after B.W. Leader, R.A., a too realistic wall-paper, hot 

brown furniture with ribbed legs, a carpet with the characteristics of a retired governess who has 

taken to drink, and a black cloud on the ceiling over the incandescent burners. Happily these 

surroundings did not annoy him. They did not annoy him because he never saw them. When his 

eyes were not resting on beautiful things, they were not in this
