in fact save those=20

few sentences, written in French, in a cramped hand, and which seemed to da=
nce a wild saraband=20

before his eyes:       "MILOR,--       "You tried to steal my daughter from=
 me, but I have taken her=20

from      you now. By the time this reaches you we shall be on the high sea=
s      on our way to=20

Holland, thence to Coblentz, where Mademoiselle de      Kernogan will in ac=
cordance with my=20

wishes be united in lawful      marriage to M. Martin-Roget whom I have cho=
sen to be her husband.=20

She is not and never was your wife. As far as one may look into the      fu=
ture, I can assure you=20

that you will never in life see her      again."  And to this monstrous doc=
ument of appalling=20

callousness and cold-blooded cruelty there was appended the signature of An=
dre Dieudonne Duc=20

de Kernogan.  But unlike the writer thereof Lord Anthony Dewhurst neither s=
tormed nor raged: he=20

did not even tear the execrable letter into an hundred fragments. His firm =
hand closed over it with=20

one convulsive clutch, and that was all. Then he slipped the crumpled paper=
 into his pocket. Quite=20

deliberately he took out some money and gave a piece of silver to the the r=
ising sun, leaving his=20

small chiefs to carry out his plans.  Some of these are _very_ small chiefs=
, unfit to carry out any=20

plans.  Others are bad small chiefs, that will carry out only such plans as=
 are sure to benefit=20

themselves.  It is these men with whom we have to deal.  It is these who de=
serve to be swept off=20

the face of the earth."  A number of emphatic nods and "waughs" at this poi=
nt showed that=20

Okematan had at last touched a key-note with which his braves could shout i=
n harmony.  "But,"=20

resumed the chief impressively, "we cannot sweep them off the earth; we can=
not even sweep=20

them off the banks of Red River.  We might easily sweep the Saulteaux into =
Lake Winnipeg if we=20

thought it worth while to try, but the Palefaces--never!  Okematan has trav=
elled far to the south=20

and seen the Palefaces there.  They cannot be counted.  They swarm like our=
 locusts; they darken=20

the earth as our buffaloes darken the plains.  They live in stone wigwams. =
 I have seen one of their=20

wigwams that was big enough to hold all the Crees' wigwams bundled together=
.  If we killed or=20

scalped all the Palefaces in Red River the great white chief would come ove=
r the great salt lake=20

with an army that would swallow us up as the buffalo=20

"I thank you very much," he said somewhat haltingly. "I quite understand ev=
erything now."  The=20

woman curtseyed and thanked him; tears were in her eyes, for it seemed to h=
er that never had=20

she seen such grief depicted upon any human face. She preceded him to the h=
all door and held it=20

open for him, while he passed out. After the brief gleam of sunshine it had=
 started to rain again,=20

but he didn't seem to care. The woman suggested fetching a hackney coach, b=
ut he refused quite=20

politely, quite gently: he even lifted his hat as he went out. Obviously he=
 did not know what he was=20

doing. Then he went out into the rain and strode slowly across the Place.  =

n, with a slight=20

touch of pathos in his tone, "there are good and bad men among the Paleface=
s, just as there are=20

good and bad among ourselves.  I have dwelt for many moons with a tribe cal=
led Scosh-min.=20

Okematan loves the Scosh-min.  They speak a wonderful language, and some of=
 them are too=20

fond of fire-water; but their braves fear nothing, and their squaws are pre=
tty and work hard--almost=20

as hard as our squaws--though they are not quite as good-looking as ours.  =
They are too white--

their faces are like buffalo fat!"  A "Waugh," which might be translated "H=
ear, hear," greeted this=20

statement of opinion.  "Now," continued our chief, "if we swept away all th=
e people of Red River,=20
