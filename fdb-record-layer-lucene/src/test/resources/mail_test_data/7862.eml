"He has carried off a diamond ring which I came up here to sell him."  "A v=
ery improbable story,"=20

said Mr. Piper, suspiciously. "What should such a boy have to do with a dia=
mond ring?"  Nothing is=20

easier than to impart suspicion. Men are prone to believe evil of each othe=
r; and Paul was=20

destined to realize this. The hotel servants, ignorant and suspicious, caug=
ht the suggestion.  "It's=20

likely he's a' thafe," said Bridget, from a safe distance.  "If I were," sa=
id Paul, coolly, "I shouldn't be=20

apt to call your attention by such a noise. I can prove to you that I am te=
lling the truth. I stopped at=20

the office, and the bookkeeper sent a servant to show me up here."  "If thi=
s is true," said Mr. Piper,=20

"why, when you found yourself locked in, didn't you ring the bell, instead =
of making such a=20

confounded racket? My nerves won't get over it for a week."  "I didn't thin=
k of the bell," said Paul; "I=20

am not much used to hotels."  "What will we do with him?" asked James, look=
ing to Mr. Piper for=20

counsel.  "You'd better take him downstairs, and see if his story is correc=
t," said the nervous=20

gentleman, with returning good sense.  "I'll do it," said James, to whom th=
e very obvious=20

suggestion seemed marked by extraordinary wisdom, and he grasped Paul rough=
ly by the arm.=20

"You needn't hold me," said our hero, shaking off the grasp. "I haven't any=
 intention of running=20

away. I want to find out, if I can, what has become of the man that swindle=
d me."  James looked=20

doubtfully at Mr. Piper.  "I don't think he means to run away," said that g=
entleman. "I begin to think=20

his story is correct. And hark you, my young friend, if you ever get locked=
 up in a hotel room again,=20

just see if there is a bell before you make such a confounded racket."  "Ye=
s, sir, I will," said Paul,=20

half-smiling; "but I'll take care not to get locked up again. It won't be e=
asy for anybody to play that=20

trick on me again."  The party filed downstairs to the office and Paul told=
 his story to the=20

bookkeeper.  "Have you seen Mr. Montgomery go out?" asked our hero.  "Yes, =
he went out half an=20

hour ago, or perhaps more. He left his key at the desk, but said nothing. H=
e seemed to be in a=20

hurry."  "You didn't notice in what direction he went?"  "No."  Of course n=
o attempt was made to=20

detain Paul. There could be no case against him. He went out of the hotel, =
and looked up and=20

down Broadway in a state of indecision. He did not mean to sit down passive=
ly and submit to the=20

swindle. But he had no idea in what direction to search for Mr. Felix Montg=
omery.    CHAPTER=20

XIX  PAUL DELIBERATES  Paul stood in the street irresolute. He looked hopel=
essly up and down=20

Broadway, but of course the jeweler from Syracuse was not to be seen. Seeki=
ng for him in a city=20

containing hundreds of streets and millions of inhabitants was about as dis=
couraging as hunting=20

for a needle in a haystack. But difficult as it was, Paul was by no means r=
eady to give up the=20

search. Indeed, besides the regret he felt at the loss, he was mortified at=
 having been so easily=20

outwitted.  "He's taken me in just as if I was a country boy," thought Paul=
. "I dare say he's laughing=20

at me now. I'd like to get even with him."  Finally he decided to go to Tif=
fany's, and ask them to=20

detain any one who might bring in the ring and offer it for sale. He at onc=
e acted upon this thought,=20

and, hailing a Broadway stage, for no time was to be lost, soon reached his=
 destination. Entering=20

the store, he walked up to the counter and addressed the clerk to whom he h=
ad before shown the=20

ring.  "Do you remember my offering you a diamond ring for sale this mornin=
g?" he asked.  "Yes, I=20

remember it very well. Have you got it with you?"  "No, it has been stolen =
from me."  "Indeed! How=20

was that?" asked the clerk, with interest.  "I met in the cars a well-dress=
ed man, who called himself=20

a jeweler from Syracuse. He examined the ring, and offered me more than Mr.=
 Tiffany, but asked=20

me to bring it to him at Lovejoy's Hotel. When I got there, he drugged me w=
ith chloroform, and=20

when I recovered he was gone."  "You have been unlucky. There are plenty of=
 such swindlers=20



about. You should have been careful about displaying the ring before strang=
ers."  "I was showing it=20

to a friend."  "Have you notified the police?"  "Not yet. I came here to le=
t you know, because I=20

thought the thief might bring it in here to sell."  "Very likely. Give me a=
 description of him."  Paul=20

described Mr. Felix Montgomery to the best of his ability.  "I think I shou=
ld know him from your=20

description. I will speak to Mr. Tiffany, and he will no doubt give orders =
to detain any person who=20

may offer the ring for sale."  "Thank you."  "If you will give me your addr=
ess, we will notify you in=20

case the ring is brought in."  Paul left his address, and went out of the s=
tore, feeling that he had=20

taken one step toward the recovery of his treasure. He next visited the pol=
ice headquarters, and=20

left a detailed description of the man who had relieved him of the ring and=
 of the circumstances=20

attending the robbery. Then he went home.  His little missal from the capit=
al, and he, just like an=20

Arab or an Indian leaving home, unmoved, merely observing that the folk in =
Asuncion were =E2=80=9Cmuy=20

ladino=E2=80=9D (very cunning), and it behoved a Christian to take care.  A=
 day=E2=80=99s long march brought us=20

near Santa Rosa, and our guide here fell into his first and only error on t=
he road.  Pursuing an=20

interminable palm-wood, we came out upon a little plain, all broken here an=
d there with stunted=20

Yatais, then to our great disgust the road bifurcated, and our guide insist=
ed on striking to the left,=20

though I was almost certain it was wrong.  After an hour of heavy ploughing=
 through the sand, I=20

suddenly saw two immense palm-trees about a league away upon the right, and=
 luckily=20

remembered that they stood one on each side of the old Jesuit church at San=
ta Rosa, and after an=20

hour of scrambling through a stony wood arrived at the crossing of the litt=
le river just outside the=20

place. Girls carrying water-jars upon their heads, and dressed in long whit=
e shifts, embroidered=20

round the neck with coarse black lace, were going and coming in a long proc=
ession to the stream.=20

A few old men and about thirty boys composed almost the entire male populat=
ion of the town.=20

Women entirely ruled the roost, and managed everything, and, as far as I ca=
n now recall, did it not=20

much more inefficiently than men.  The curious wooden church, dark, and wit=
h overhanging eaves,=20

and all the images of saints still left from Jesuit times in choir and nave=
, with columns hewn from=20

the trunks of massive trees, stood in the centre of the village, which was =
built after the fashion of a=20

miner=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Crow,=E2=80=9D or of a St. Simonian phalanstery, ea=
ch dwelling at least a hundred feet in length,=20

and all partitioned off in the inside for ten or fifteen families.  The pla=
za was overgrown with grass,=20

and on it donkeys played, chasing each other up and down, and sometimes run=
ning up the=20

wooden steps of the great church, and stumbling down again.  Those who had =
horses led them=20

down to bathe, cut =E2=80=9Cpindo=E2=80=9D {69} for them, rode them at even=
ing time, and passed their time in=20

dressing and in combing them to get them into condition for the Sunday=E2=
=80=99s running at the ring,=20

which sport introduced by the Jesuits has continued popular in all the vill=
ages of the Misiones up=20

to the present time.  The women flirted with the men, who by their rarity w=
ere at a premium, gave=20

themselves airs, and went about surrounded by a perpetual and admiring band=
.  The single little=20

shop, which contained needles, gunpowder, and gin, was kept by an Italian, =
who, as he told me,=20

liked the place, lent money, was a professing and quite unabashed polygamis=
t, and I have no=20

doubt long ere this time has made a fortune, and retired to live at Genoa i=
n the self-same green=20

velvet suit in which he left his home.  In this Arcadia we remained some da=
ys, and hired several=20

girls to bathe the horses, which they performed most conscientiously, splas=
hing and shouting in=20

the stream for hours at a time, and bringing back the horses clean, and gar=
nished with flowers in=20

their manes.  I rode one day to see a village two or three leagues away, wh=
ere report said some of=20



the Jesuit books had been preserved; got lost, and passed the night in a sm=
all clearing, where a=20

fat and well-cared-for-looking handsome roan horse was tied.  On seeing me =
he broke his picket-

rope, ran furiously four or five times round me in circles, and then advanc=
ing put his nostrils close=20

to the nostrils of my horse, and seemed to talk to him.  His owner, an old =
Paraguayan, lame from a=20

wound received in jumping from a canoe onto the deck of a Brazilian ironcla=
d, told me his horse=20

had been with him far into the interior, and for a year had never seen anot=
her horse.  But, he said,=20

=E2=80=9CTata Dios has given every animal its speech after its kind, and he=
 is glad to see your horse, and is=20

no doubt asking him the news.=E2=80=9D  During the night, I cannot say exac=
tly what the two horses talked=20

about, but the old Paraguayan talked for hours of his adventures in the lat=
ely terminated war.  It=20

appeared that he, with seven companions, thinking to take a Brazilian ironc=
lad anchored in the=20

Paraguay, concealed themselves in a small canoe, behind some drift-wood, an=
d floating plants=20

called =E2=80=9Ccamalotes,=E2=80=9D drifted down with the stream, and comin=
g to the ship jumped with a yell=20

aboard.  The Brazilians, taken by surprise, all ran below, and the poor Par=
aguayans thinking the=20

ship was theirs, sat quietly down upon the deck to plan what they should do=
.  Seeing them off their=20

guard, some of the crew turned a gun upon them, and at the first fire kille=
d six, and wounded my=20

host, who sprang into the stream, and gained the bank, but most unluckily n=
ot on the Paraguayan=20

side.  As at that time the Chaco Indians, who had profited by the war to ma=
ke invasions upon=20

every side, killed every Christian, as my host said =E2=80=9Csin perdon,=E2=
=80=9D so he remained half starving for a=20

night and day.  On the third morning, wounded as he was, and seeing he must=
 starve or else be=20

killed if seen by Indians, he got a fallen tree, and=20


_
"Well, Paul?" she said, inquiringly.  "I've got bad news, mother," he said.=
  "What is it? Tell me=20

quick!" she said, nervously.  "The ring has been stolen from me."  "How did=
 it happen, Paul?"=20

"First, I must tell you how much the ring is worth. I went up to Tiffany's,=
 and showed the ring to Mr.=20

Tiffany himself. He told me that he would give me two hundred and fifty dol=
lars for it, if I would=20

satisfy him that I had a right to sell it."  "Two hundred and fifty dollars=
!" repeated Mrs. Hoffman, in=20

amazement.  "Yes, the diamond is very large and pure."  "Two hundred and fi=
fty dollars would be=20

a great help to us."  "Yes, mother, that is what makes me feel so bad about=
 being swindled out of=20

it."  "Tell me how it happened. Is there no chance of recovering it?"  "A l=
ittle. I shall do what I can. I=20

have already notified the police, and Mr. Tiffany."  "You have not told me =
yet how you lost it."=20

When Paul had told marvellously escaping the fierce fish who come like wolv=
es to the scent of=20

blood, and unmolested by the alligators, he reached the other side. There h=
e was found by some=20

women, lying unconscious on the river-bank, was cured, and though scarred i=
n a dozen places,=20

and lame for life, escaped, as he informed me, by his devotion to San Jos=
=C3=A9, whom he described=20

under the title of the =E2=80=9Chusband of the mother of our Lord.=E2=80=9D=
  In the morning he rode a league with=20

me upon the way, and as we parted his horse neighed shrilly, reared once or=
 twice, and plunged,=20

and when we separated I looked back and saw the devotee of St. Joseph sitti=
ng as firmly as a=20

centaur, as his horse loped along the sandy palm-tree-bordered trail.  Duri=
ng our stay at Santa=20

Rosa, which was an offshoot from the more important mission of Santa Maria =
de F=C3=A9, although they=20

had no priest the people gathered in the church, the Angelus was rung at ev=
ening=20


_
the cars that you had offered it at Tiffany's?"  "Yes, and I mentioned his =
offer."  "Perhaps the thief=20

would be cautious about going there, for that very reason. He might think t=
he ring would be=20

recognized."  "He would go to a large place, thinking that so his hat and m=
urmured something that=20

he thought apposite.  Thus did ceremony, always much more important than me=
re faith, continue,=20

and no doubt blessed the poor people to the full as much as if it had been =
duly sanctified by a=20

tonsured priest, and consecrated by a=20


_
more readily purchased there."  "He might go to Ball & Black's."  "That is =
true."  "It would be well to=20

give notice there also."  "I will go up there at once. I only wish I could =
meet Mr. Felix Montgomery; I=20

don't think he would find it so easy to outreach me a second time."  "Take =
some dinner first, Paul."=20

"Then I must hurry it down, mother; I don't want to run the risk of getting=
 too late to Ball & Black's. I=20

can't help thinking what a splendid thing it would be if we had the two hun=
dred and fifty dollars. I=20

would buy out Barry's stand, and I would get a sewing-machine for you, and =
we could live much=20

more comfortably. It makes me mad to think I let that villain take me in so=
! He must offertory.  We=20

left the place with real regret, and to this day, when in our hurried life =
I dream of peace, my=20

thoughts go back to the old Paraguayan Jesuit =E2=80=9Ccapilla=E2=80=9D los=
t in the woods of Morosimo, Curupay,=20

and Yba-hai, and with its two tall feathery palm-trees rustling above the d=
esecrated church; to the=20

long strings of white-robed women carrying water-jars, and to the old-world=
 life, perhaps by this=20

time altered and swept away, or yet again not altered, and passing still in=
 the same quiet fashion=20

as when we were there.  Little by little we left the relatively open countr=
y of the Misiones behind,=20

and passing Ibyra-puc=C3=BA, San Roque, and Ximenes, came to the river Tebi=
cuary.  We passed it in=20
