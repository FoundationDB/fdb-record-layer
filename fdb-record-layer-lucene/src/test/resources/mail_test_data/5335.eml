HIPPIAS ***     Produced by state right, we must first be community right."  Three objectives were 

selected "with which to attract community interest and membership; safety to life, in the form of 

proper police protection; safety to property, in the form of adequate hydrant and fire-engine 

service; and safety to health, in careful supervision of the water and milk used in the community. 

"The three S's," as they were called, brought an immediate response. They were practical in their 

appeal, and members began to come in.  The police force was increased from one officer at night 

and none in the day, to three at night and two during the day, and to this the Association added 

two special night officers of its own.  Private detectives were intermittently brought in to "check up" 

and see that the service was vigilant.  A fire hydrant was placed within seven hundred feet of 

every house, with the insurance rates reduced from twelve and one-half to thirty per cent; the 

services of three fire-engine companies was arranged for.  Fire-gongs were introduced into the 

community to guard against danger from interruption of telephone service.  The water supply was 

chemically analyzed each month and the milk supply carefully scrutinized.  One hundred and fifty 

new electric-light posts specially designed, and pronounced by experts as the most beautiful and 

practical road lamps ever introduced into any community, were erected, making Merion the best-

lighted community in its vicinity.  At every corner was erected an artistically designed cast-iron 

road sign; instead of the unsightly wooden ones, cast-iron automobile warnings were placed at

LESSER HIPPIAS  by Plato  (see Appendix I)   Translated by Benjamin Jowett     APPENDIX I.  It 

seems impossible to separate by any exact line the genuine writings of Plato from the spurious. 

The only external evidence to them which is of much value is that of Aristotle; for the Alexandrian 

catalogues of a century later include manifest forgeries. Even the value of the Aristotelian authority 

is a good deal impaired by the uncertainty concerning the date and authorship of the writings 

which are ascribed to him. And several of the citations of Aristotle omit the name of Plato, and 

some of them omit the name of the dialogue from which they are taken. Prior, however, to the 

enquiry about the writings of a particular author, general considerations which bulletin-boards, to 

supplant the display of notices on trees and poles, were placed at the railroad station; litter-cans 

were distributed over the entire community; a new railroad station and post-office were secured; 

the station grounds were laid out as a garden by a landscape architect; new roads of permanent 

construction, from curb to curb, were laid down; uniform tree-planting along the roads was 

introduced; bird-houses were made and sold, so as to attract bird-life to the community; toll-gates 

were abolished along the two main arteries of travel; the removal of all telegraph and telephone 

poles was begun; an efficient Boy Scout troop was organized, and an American Legion post; the 

automobile speed limit was reduced from twenty-four to fifteen miles as
