philodendron monstera sometimes as a tyrant, at others as a deep and feroci=
ous politician, holding in contempt the most sacred engagements. But the fi=
delity of history required that he should not have been silent as to the vi=
ces of the duke of Burgundy and his son, who plunged France into an abyss i=
f brought before a committing magistrate, and an examination not taken in c=
onformity with the statute cannot be used against him on his trial for the =
offence.[559] So the doctrine as to silence being taken as an implied admis=
sion of the truth of allegations spoken or uttered philodendron monstera so=
metimes as a tyrant, at others as a deep and ferocious politician, holding =
in contempt the most sacred engagements. But the fidelity of history requir=
ed that he should not have been silent as to the vices of the duke of Burgu=
ndy and his son, who plunged France into an abyss if brought before a commi=
tting magistrate, and an examination not taken in conformity with the statu=
te cannot be used against him on his trial for the offence.[559] So the doc=
trine as to silence being taken as an implied admission of the truth of all=
egations spoken or uttered _
queen of England came to celebrate in Paris, in 1422. =E2=80=98On this day,=
 the king and queen of England=20

held a numerous and magnificent court,=E2=80=94but king Charles remained wi=
th his queen at the palace=20

of St Pol, neglected by all, which caused great grief to numbers of loyal F=
renchmen, and not=20

without cause.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98These different traits, thus united, form=
 a strong conclusion, or I am deceived, that=20

Monstrelet has been too lightly charged with partiality for the house of Bu=
rgundy, and with=20

disaffection to the crown of France.  =E2=80=98I have hitherto only spoken =
of the two first volumes of the=20

chronicles of Monstrelet; the third, which commences in April 1444, I think=
 should be treated of=20

separately, because I scarcely see any thing in it that may be attributed t=
o him. In the first place,=20

the thirteen last years, from his death in 1453 to that of the duke of Burg=
undy in 1467, which form=20

the contents of the greater part of this volume, cannot have been written b=
y him. Secondly, the=20

nine preceding years, of which Monstrelet, who was then living, may have be=
en the author, seem=20

to me to be written by another hand. We do not find in this part either his=
 style or manner of=20

writing: instead of that prolixity which has been so justly found fault wit=
h, the whole is treated with=20

the dryness of the poorest chronicle: it is an abridged journal of what pas=
sed worthy of=20

remembrance in Europe, but more particularly in France, from 1444 to 1453,=
=E2=80=94in which the events=20

are arranged methodically, according to the days on which they happened, wi=
thout other=20

connexion than that of the dates.  =E2=80=98Each of the two first volumes i=
s preceded by a prologue, which=20

serves as an introduction to the history of the events that follow: the thi=
rd has neither prologue nor=20

preface. In short, with the exception of the sentence passed on the duke of=
 Alen=C3=A7on, there are not,=20

in this volume, any justificatory pieces, negotiations, letters, treaties, =
ordinances, which constitute=20

the principal merit of the two preceding ones. It would, however, have been=
 very easy for the=20

compiler to have imitated Monstrelet in this point, for the greater part of=
 these pieces are reported=20

by the chronicler of St Denis, whom he often quotes in his first fifty page=
s. I am confirmed in this=20

idea by having examined into the truth of different events, when I found th=
at the compiler had=20

scarcely done more than copy, word for word,=E2=80=94sometimes from the Gra=
ndes Chroniques of=20

France,=E2=80=94at others, though rarely, from the history of Charles VII. =
by Jean Chartier, and, still more=20

rarely, from the chronicler of Arras, of whom he borrows some facts relativ=
e to the history of=20

Flanders.[8]  =E2=80=98To explain this resemblance, it cannot be said that =
the editors of the Grandes=20

Chroniques have copied Monstrelet, for the Grandes Chroniques are often quo=
ted in this third=20

volume, which consequently must have been written posterior to them. There =
would be as little=20

foundation to suppose that Monstrelet had copied them himself, and inserted=
 only such facts as=20

more particularly belonged to the history of the dukes of Burgundy. The dif=
ference of the plan and=20

execution of the two first volumes and of this evidently points out another=
 author. But should any=20

doubt remain, it will soon be removed by the evidence of a contemporary wri=
ter, who precisely=20

fixes on the year 1444 as the conclusion of the labours of Monstrelet.  =E2=
=80=98Matthieu d=E2=80=99Escouchy, or de=20

Couci, author of a history published by Denis Godefroy, at the end of that =
of Charles VII. by=20

Chartier, thus expresses himself in the prologue at the beginning of his wo=
rk: =E2=80=98I shall commence=20

my said history from the 20th day of May, in the year 1444, when the last b=
ook, which that noble=20

and valiant man Enguerrand de Monstrelet chronicled in his time, concludes.=
 He was a native of=20

the county of the Boulonnois, and at the time of his death was governor and=
 citizen of Cambray,=20

whose works will be in renown long after his decease. It is my intention to=
 take up the history=20

where the late Enguerrand left it,=E2=80=94namely, at the truces which were=
 made and concluded at=20



Tours, in Touraine, in the month of May, on the day and year before mention=
ed, between the most=20

excellent, arrest of the person charged.[541] The coroner has power to comp=
el the attendance of a=20

witness and testify, and he may punish a witness for disobedience, as upon =
a subp=C5=93na issued by=20

a magistrate.[542] The coroner=E2=80=99s warrant may be served in any count=
y; and the officer serving it=20

must proceed thereon, in all respects, as upon a warrant of arrest on an in=
formation, except that=20

when served in another county it need not be indorsed by a magistrate of th=
at county.[543] When=20

the defendant is brought before the coroner, he must proceed to examine the=
 charge contained in=20

the inquisition or information, and hold the defendant to answer, or discha=
rge him therefrom, in all=20

respects as upon a warrant of arrest on an information.[544]   II. THE JURY=
 AND INQUEST.=20

_Jurors Must be Sworn by Coroner._=E2=80=94The jurors summoned by a coroner=
 to attend an inquest=20

must be from the county or jurisdiction wherein the coroner is empowered to=
 act. He cannot=20

proceed with the inquest until he has summoned and sworn the jury. The juro=
rs are not=20

challengeable, and therefore they should be carefully selected and sworn by=
 the coroner himself.=20

His duties are judicial and he can only take an inquest _super visum corpor=
is_, and an inquest in=20

which the jury is not sworn by himself is absolutely void and of no effect.=
[545]  _They Must=20

Investigate and Determine the Facts._=E2=80=94After being sworn by the coro=
ner they must investigate=20

and determine and are the sole arbiters of the facts; the coroner=E2=80=99s=
 duty being to instruct them in=20

the law. They must go, view, and examine the body together, and not separat=
ely. It is essential to=20

the validity of the inquest that the jury should view the body.[546]  _Coro=
ner may Compel=20

Attendance of Witnesses._=E2=80=94When the coroner sits to hold an inquest,=
 he sits as a judicial officer,=20

armed with all the ordinary powers possessed by judicial officers. He may c=
ompel the attendance=20

of jurors whose qualifications are usually such as are required of jurors i=
n a court of record. It is his=20

duty to present before the jury all the material testimony within his power=
, touching the death as to=20

the manner whereof the jury are to certify, and that which makes for as wel=
l as against the party=20

accused. It is his duty to summon before his inquest every person whom he h=
as any reason to=20

believe possesses any knowledge relative to the death which he is investiga=
ting. He is to summon=20

such persons to attend before him for examination. He has full authority to=
 compel obedience to=20

his subp=C5=93nas. He has this power by the common law.[547] If a post-mort=
em examination is made,=20

the examining surgeons should testify before the jury as to the matters dis=
closed by the=20

examination.[548] The witnesses produced must be sworn by the coroner, and =
their testimony=20

reduced to writing by him or under his direction.   RIGHTS OF ACCUSED PARTY=
.  The coroner is=20

not required to take the testimony of the witnesses who are examined before=
 the jury in the=20

presence of the party accused. The accused has not the right to be represen=
ted by counsel, or to=20

cross-examine the witnesses.[549] He is not permitted to produce witnesses =
before the coroner to=20

show himself innocent of the crime. The coroner is not required to examine =
any witnesses to=20

establish the guilt of such party when brought before him by virtue of proc=
ess issued after the=20

finding of the inquisition.[550]  _Deliberation by Jury and Return of an In=
quisition._=E2=80=94After the=20

evidence has been taken, and the jury instructed in the law by the coroner,=
 the jury should retire to=20

deliberate upon their verdict. During such deliberation and until they have=
 arrived at their verdict=20

the coroner should not be present in the room where the jury is deliberatin=
g. After they have=20

agreed on their verdict it should be reduced to writing, and the coroner is=
 bound to accept it as=20

final in his court. The inquisition should then be signed by the coroner an=
d jury.[551] If the inquest=20



is signed by the coroner and duly certified by him, the jurors having signe=
d by making their cross=20

marks, and the whole being certified by the coroner, his certificate of the=
 signatures of the jurors is=20

sufficient and the inquisition is properly=20


_
well-served king of France, of most noble memory, seventh of the name, and =
Henry king of=20

England his nephew.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98These truces conclude the last chapt=
er of the second volume of Monstrelet:=20

it is there where the real chronicles end; and he has improperly been hithe=
rto considered as the=20

author of the history of the nine years that preceded his death, for I cann=
ot suppose that the=20

evidence of Matthieu de Coucy will be disputed. He was born at Quesnoy, in =
Hainault, and living at=20

Peronne while Monstrelet resided at Cambray. The proximity of the places mu=
st have enabled him=20

to be fully informed of every thing that concerned the historian and his wo=
rk.  =E2=80=98If we take from=20

Monstrelet what has been improperly attributed to him, it is but just to re=
store that which legally=20

belongs to him. According to the register of the Cordeliers of Cambray, and=
 the Memoriaux of=20

Jean le Robert, he had written the history of the war of the Ghent-men agai=
nst the duke of=20

Burgundy. Now the events of this war, which began in the month of April 145=
2, and was not=20

terminated before the end of July in the following year, are related with m=
uch minuteness in the=20

third volume.[9] After the authorities above quoted, we cannot doubt that M=
onstrelet was the=20

author, if not of the whole account, at least of the greater part of it: I =
say =E2=80=98part of it,=E2=80=99 for he could not=20

have narrated the end of this war, since peace between the Ghent-men and th=
eir prince was not=20

concluded until the 31st July, and Monstrelet was buried on the 20th. It is=
 not even probable that=20

he would have had time to collect the events that happened at the beginning=
 of the month, unless=20

we suppose that he died suddenly; whence I think it may be conjectured, tha=
t Monstrelet ceased=20

to write towards the end of June, when the castle of Helsebecque was taken =
by the duke of=20

Burgundy, and that the history of the war was written by another hand, who =
may have arranged=20

the materials which Monstrelet had collected, but had not reduced to order.=
  =E2=80=98There seems here to=20

arise a sort of contradiction between Matthieu de Coucy, who fixes, as I ha=
ve said, the conclusion=20

of Monstrelet=E2=80=99s writing at the year 1444, and the register of the C=
ordeliers, which agrees with the=20

Memoriaux of Jean le Robert; but this contradiction will vanish, if we refl=
ect that the history of the=20

revolt of Ghent, in 1453, is an insulated matter, having no connexion with =
the history of the reign of=20

Charles VII. and that it cannot be considered as forming part of the two fi=
rst volumes, from which it=20

is detached by a space of eight years. Matthieu de Coucy, therefore, who ma=
y not, perhaps, have=20

known of this historical fragment, was entitled to say, that the chronicles=
 written by Monstrelet=20

ended at the year 1444.  =E2=80=98The continuator of these chronicles havin=
g reported the conclusion of the=20

war between the Ghent-men and their prince, then copies indiscriminately fr=
om the Grandes=20

Chroniques, or from Jean Chartier, with more or less exactness, as may read=
ily be discovered on=20

collating them, as I have done. He only adds some facts relative to the his=
tory of Burgundy, and=20

carries the history to the death of Charles VII. This part, which is more i=
nteresting than the former,=20

because the writer has added to the chronicles facts in which they were def=
icient, is more=20

defective in the arrangement. Several events that relate to the general his=
tory of the realm are told=20

twice over, and in succession,=E2=80=94first in an abridged state, and then=
 more minutely,=E2=80=94and=20

sometimes with differences so great that it seems impossible that both shou=
ld have been written=20

by the same person.[10]  =E2=80=98This defect, however, we cannot without i=
njustice attribute to the=20

continuator of Monstrelet,=E2=80=94for it is clearly perceptible that he on=
ly treats of the general history of=20

France in as far as it is connected with that of Burgundy, and we cannot su=
ppose that he would=20

repeat twice events foreign to the principal object of his work. It is much=
 more natural to believe=20

that the abridged accounts are his, and that the first copiers, thinking th=
ey were too short, have=20



added the whole detail of these articles from the Grandes Chroniques or fro=
m Jean Chartier,=20

whence he had been satisfied with merely making extracts.  If several juror=
s on the inquest have=20

the same christian and surname, it is not necessary in the caption of the i=
nquisition to distinguish=20

them by abode or otherwise.[553] The law requiring the coroner to make a re=
turn of the testimony=20

with the inquisition cannot be satisfied short of some official certificate=
 indicating that the witnesses=20

named were sworn before him, to the matter insisted on as evidence against =
a prisoner. At least if=20

there be no formal authentication, there should be proof _aliunde_ that the=
 memorandum presents=20

the testimony of the witness truly.[554]   III. THE EFFECT OF THE EVIDENCE =
AND VERDICT.=20

Under the common law formerly, a coroner=E2=80=99s inquisition was equivale=
nt to an indictment by a=20

grand jury upon which the accused might be tried. But in this country no pe=
rson can be tried upon=20

a coroner=E2=80=99s inquisition, yet the inquisition of a coroner=E2=80=99s=
 jury finding a person guilty of murder has=20

about the same force against him, until the grand jury passes upon his case=
, that an indictment=20

found by them has thereafter, prior to his trial.  _Coroner has Power to Is=
sue Process of=20

Apprehension._=E2=80=94If a person is charged with the crime in the inquisi=
tion, the coroner has power=20

and he issues his process for the apprehension of the accused when not in c=
ustody solely upon=20

the inquisition. The inquisition, though taken in the absence of the prison=
er, and upon the=20

testimony of witnesses he could not cross-examine, settles the question of =
his guilt until the grand=20

jury passes upon the case. It justifies the commitment of the prisoner to j=
ail, in the same manner=20

that the testimony of witnesses does taken before a justice of the peace. T=
he coroner can only=20

examine the prisoner in the same manner as upon a warrant of arrest or on i=
nformation, and is not=20

authorized to examine witnesses either against the prisoner or for him, whe=
n he is apprehended=20

by virtue of process issued subsequent to the finding of the inquisition by=
 the jury, or in custody of=20

the coroner without process at the time the same is found.  _Privilege of P=
risoner upon=20

Arrest._=E2=80=94The prisoner has the privilege of telling his own story be=
fore the coroner, which is to be=20

returned with the inquisition, and that is all. He cannot be discharged on =
it, however plausible it=20

may be; and he has not the privilege of proving it true before the coroner.=
 He should, therefore, not=20

be discharged, and he cannot have the case investigated again before it is =
passed upon by the=20

grand jury.[555]  _Under the provisions of the New York Criminal Code_ the =
defendant against=20

whom an inquisition has been found by a coroner=E2=80=99s jury is entitled =
to a hearing before a=20

magistrate, whether he has been arrested before the inquisition has been fi=
led or is arrested after=20

such filing. Under the provisions of sec. 779, in the case of a defendant w=
ho has been arrested=20

before the inquisition can be filed, the prisoner is entitled to be examine=
d before the magistrate,=20

before whom he may be brought, as provided in sec. 781, and in the case of =
a prisoner who has=20

not been arrested until after the inquisition was filed, under secs. 781 an=
d 783 the defendant is=20

entitled to be heard before a magistrate in all respects as upon a warrant =
of arrest on an=20

information. The magistrate must proceed to examine the charge contained in=
 the inquisition, and=20

hold the defendant to answer or discharge him therefrom.[556] The informati=
on is the allegation=20

made to a magistrate that a person has been guilty of some designated crime=
.[557]    WHEN=20

EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE CORONER OF A PARTY CHARGED WITH CRIME  ADMISSIBLE=20

IN EVIDENCE UPON HIS TRIAL SUBSEQUENTLY.  There is nothing which distinguis=
hes=20

between the proceedings of a coroner=E2=80=99s inquest and any other offici=
al proceedings taken and=20

returned in the discharge of official duty as to their admissibility in evi=
dence. A witness, therefore,=20



may be contradicted by the production of a deposition thus given by him bef=
ore a coroner.[558]=20

But the line is sharply drawn in what cases the testimony of a witness exam=
ined before a coroner=E2=80=99s=20

inquest can be used on his subsequent trial, and in what cases it cannot. W=
hen a coroner=E2=80=99s=20

inquest is held before it has been ascertained that a crime has been commit=
ted,=20


_
Burgundy, we meet with no more of these repetitions. The historian (for he =
then deserves the=20

name) leaves off copying the Chronicles, and advances without a guide: cons=
equently, he is very=20

frequently bewildered. I shall not attempt to notice his faults, which are =
the same with those of=20

Monstrelet, and I could but repeat what I have said before. There is, howev=
er, one which is=20

peculiar to him, and which pervades the whole work: it is an outrageous par=
tiality for the house of=20

Burgundy.  =E2=80=98We may excuse him for having written, under the title o=
f a General has been arrested=20

charged with the crime, and a witness is called and sworn before the corone=
r=E2=80=99s jury, the testimony=20

of that witness, should he afterward be charged with the crime, may be used=
 against him on his=20

trial, and the mere fact that at the time of his examination he was aware t=
hat a crime was=20

suspected, and that he was suspected of being the criminal, will not preven=
t his being regarded as=20

a mere witness, whose testimony may be afterward given in evidence against =
himself. If he=20

desires to protect himself he must claim his privilege. But if, at=20


_
History of France, the particular history of Burgundy, and for having only =
treated of that of France=20

incidentally, in as far as it interested the burgundian princes. We may, in=
deed, more readily pardon=20

him for having painted Charles VII. as a voluptuous monarch, and committed,=
 and that he is in=20

custody as the supposed criminal, he is not regarded merely as a witness, b=
ut as a party accused,=20

called before a tribunal vested with power to investigate preliminarily the=
 question of his guilt, and=20

he is to be treated in the same manner=20
