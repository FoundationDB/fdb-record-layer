needed for use in fields it would scarcely be necessary to pulverize it, as mixing it with dry soil,

merited celebrity. Various improvements in Woulfe's bottles have been devised. Still I believe an 

apparatus replete with similar advantages, but less unwieldy, less liable to fracture; and having 

fewer junctures to make at each operation, has been a great desideratum with every practical 

chemist. It has, however, ceased to be so with me, since I contrived the apparatus which I am 

about to describe.  Fig. 1. represents 3 jars placed concentrically within each other, and so 

proportioned and situated, as to admit 2 open-necked concentric bell glasses alternately between 

them. The neck of the exterior bell glass is introduced into the tubulure of the receiver above, and 

receives the neck of the interior bell glass. Into this is inserted a trumpet-shaped tube. The two 

interior jars are

operation, remove (without taking them apart) the bell glasses, receiver, and tube from the jars. 

Pour into the latter the fluid, to be impregnated, till it reaches the height marked by the dots. The 

funnel mouth, _m_, of the receiver being provided with a suitable cork soaked in wax, fasten into it 

firmly the beak of the retort, containing the generating materials. The bell glasses are then to be 

replaced in the jars, and arranged as in the figure. It must be self-evident that the gas proceeding 

from the retort, (if the juncture at _m_ be air tight) must press on the fluid in the innermost jar, 

through the trumpet-shaped tube. If not imbibed with adequate speed, it must soon press on the 

fluid at _a_, causing it to subside to the narrow part of the foot _f_, and thus to expose a much 

larger surface. If the absorption be still inadequate, a further subsidence must ensue, and the gas 

escaping round the brim of the interior bell glass will act on the fluid at _b_, and enlarge its surface 

by depressing it to the narrow part of the foot F. Should the increased pressure and more 

extended contact thus obtained, be still incompetent to effect a complete absorption, the excess of 

the gas may escape round the brim of the external bell glass into the atmosphere.  [Illustration: 

_Fig. 1._  _Fig. 4._  _Fig. 5._  _Fig. 3._  _Fig. 2._  _Drawn & Engraved by Kneass, Young & Co._] 

But so effectual is this process in promoting impregnation, that I have obtained strong muriatic 

acid in the central jar, without producing any sensible acidity in the outside one. Absorption into 



the retort or receiver, is prevented by not allowing as much fluid to be above the mouth of the 

trumpet-shaped tube, as would be competent to fill the cavity between it, and the termination of 

the open neck of the exterior bell glass at _t_. As this neck rises about 2 or 3 inches into the 

receiver, it prevents any foul matter which may condense or boil over, from getting into the jars. If 

practicable, it would be better that the bell glasses, and tube, and receiver, should be united 

together while hot, at the glass-house. If all could not be joined in this way, it would still be 

advantageous to unite thus the receiver, and the exterior bell glass. The interior bell and tube 

might then be fastened together, by grinding or luting. As yet I have only used lutings of waxed 

cloth, or cork. It may be proper to
