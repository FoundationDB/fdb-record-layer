the surface is stirred the better will be the crop.  As to varieties, the old Red Wethersfield and the 

Danvers Yellow are my favorites. The Yellow Strasburg is a good yellow variety, and there are 

quite a number of others that are good. In cultivating I keep the surface level, as they do better if 

kept in this way than if they are hilled up. Thin out so that the plants do not crowd each other--they 

should stand two or three inches apart--if you want large onions at maturity.      N. J. SHEPHERD

Farm  PROPERTY OF COL. C. F. MILLS, SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS.]  The bull Royalist 3d, 4500, 

here portrayed, stands at the head of the superb Jersey herd owned by Col. Charles F. Mills, 

Springfield, Illinois. He was bred by Mr. Samuel Stratton; dropped December 13, 1878; got by imp. 

Royalist 2906; dam imp. Nelly instruments of nature in active operation, producing with slow, but 

certain gradations, the same results.   _A destructive Insect._  But I will not enlarge on a fact 

already familiar. I will ask your further indulgence only, while I communicate an authentic and 

curious fact for the information of the zoologist.  In the Choctaw country, one hundred and thirty 

miles northeast of Natchez, a part of the public road is rendered famous on account of the 

periodical return of a poisonous and destructive fly. Contrary to the custom of other insects, it 

always _appears_ when the _cold weather_ commences in December, and as invariably 

_disappears_ on the approach of _warm weather_, which is about the first of April. It is said to 

have been remarked first in the winter of 1807, _during a snowstorm_; when its effects upon cattle 

and horses were observed to be similar to those of the gnat and musqueto, in

the first prize over all Jersey in 1877; first prize and silver cup at St. Saviour's Show in 1877; first 

prize at the great St. Louis Fair as a three-year-old, and grand sweepstakes at St. Louis Fair in 

1879 as the best Jersey bull of any age. Her sire, Duke (76), won first prize over the Island, Herd 

Book Parochial prize, and first Herd Book prize at Royal Jersey Show in 1875. Merry at the same 

season of the year, without producing extensive mischief, until the winter of 1816, when it began to 

be generally fatal to the horses of travellers. So far as I recollect, it was stated, that from thirty to 

forty travelling horses were destroyed during this winter. The consequences were alarming. In the 

wilderness, where a man's horse is his chief dependence, the traveller
