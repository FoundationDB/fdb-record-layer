 off at R. U. E. will be=20

seen a hatred for uniforms as such, and particularly for phoney uniforms th=
at mean nothing and=20

cost $18.00 in particular.  [Illustration with caption: And at that it seem=
s a lot of money to pay for a=20

rig which can be worn at most only two months]  And then, with a quick curt=
ain, the good ship=20

Espagne, a French liner, is discovered in New York harbour the next day wit=
h Henry and me=20

aboard her, trying to distinguish as she crawfishes out of the dock, the fa=
ces of our waving friends=20

from the group upon the pier.  The good ship Espagne is all steamed up and =
scooting through the=20

night, with two or three hundred others of the cast of characters aboard; a=
nd there is Europe and=20

the war in the cast of characters, and the Boche, and Fritzie and the Hun, =
that diabolic trinity of=20

evil, and just back of the boat on the scenery of the first act, splattered=
 like guinea freckles all over=20

the American map for three thousand miles north, south, east and west, are =
a thousand replicas of=20

Wichita and Emporia. So it really is not of arms and the man that this stor=
y is written, nor of Henry=20

and me, and the war; but it is the constantly cloudy. As the breeze is not =
felt in these immense=20

forests of Guiana, and the refluent polar currents do not penetrate them, t=
he column of air which=20

reposes on this wooded zone is not renewed by dryer strata. It is saturated=
 with vapours which are=20

condensed into equatorial rains. The missionary assured us that it often ra=
ins here four or five=20

months without cessation.  The temperature of Javita is cooler than that of=
 Maypures, but=20

considerably hotter than that of the Guainia or Rio Negro. The centigrade t=
hermometer kept up in=20

the day to twenty-six or twenty-seven degrees; and in the night to twenty-o=
ne degrees.  From the=20

30th of April to the 11th of May, I had not been able to see any star in th=
e meridian so as to=20

determine the latitude of places. I watched whole nights in order to make u=
se of the method of=20

double altitudes; but all my efforts were useless. The fogs of the north of=
 Europe are not more=20

constant than those of the equatorial regions of Guiana. On the 4th of May,=
 I saw the sun for some=20

minutes; and found by the chronometer and the horary angles the longitude o=
f Javita to be 70=20

degrees 22 minutes, or 1 degree 15 minutes farther west than the longitude =
of the junction of the=20

Apure=20


_
we shall celebrate hereinafter as we unfold our tale. Of course, that makes=
 it provincial. And=20

people living in New York or Boston, or Philadelphia (but not Chicago, for =
half of the people there=20

have just come to town and the other half is just ready to leave town) may =
not understand this=20

story. For in some respects New York is larger than Wichita and Emporia; bu=
t not so much larger;=20

for mere numbers of population amount to little. There is always an angle o=
f the particular from=20

which one can see it as a part of the universal; and seen properly the fini=
te is always infinite. And=20

that brings us back naturally to Henry and me, looking out at the scurrying=
 stars in the ocean as=20

we hurried through the black night on the good ship Espagne. We had just fo=
lded away a fine=20

Sunday dinner, a French Sunday dinner, beginning with onion soup which was =
strange; and as=20

ominous of our journey into the Latin world as a blast of trumpets opening =
a Wagnerian overture.=20

Indeed that onion soup was threaded through our whole trip like a motif. Ou=
r dinner that night=20

ended in cheese and everything. It was our first meal aboard the boat. Duri=
ng two or three=20

courses, we had considered the value of food as a two-way is interesting fo=
r laying down on our=20

maps the unknown country lying between the Xie and the sources of the Issan=
a, situated on the=20

same meridian with the mission of Javita.  The Indians of Javita, whose num=
ber amounts to one=20

hundred and sixty, now belong for the most part to the nations of the Poimi=
sanos, the Echinavis,=20

and the Paraganis. They are employed in the construction of boats, formed o=
f the trunks of=20

sassafras, a large species of laurel, hollowed by means of fire and the hat=
chet. These trees are=20

more than one hundred feet high; the wood is yellow, resinous, almost incor=
ruptible in water, and=20

has a very agreeable smell. We saw them at San Fernando, at Javita, and mor=
e particularly at=20

Esmeralda, where most of the canoes of the Orinoco are constructed, because=
 the adjacent=20

forests furnish the largest trunks of sassafras.  The forest between Javita=
 and the Cano Pimichin,=20

contains an immense quantity of gigantic trees, ocoteas, and laurels, the A=
masonia arborea,* (*=20

This is a new species of the genus taligalea of Aublet. On the same spot gr=
ow the Bignonia=20

_
later in the dinner we ordered our food on its merits as a one-way luxury, =
with small thought as to=20

its other uses. So we leaned against the rail in the night and thought larg=
e thoughts about Wichita=20

and Emporia.  Here we were, two middle-aged men, nearing fifty years, going=
 out to a ruthless war=20

without our wives. We had packed our own valises at the hotel that very mor=
ning in fear and=20

trembling. We realized that probably we were leaving half our things in clo=
sets and drawers and=20

were taking the wrong things with us, and checking the right things in our =
trunks at our hotels in=20

New York. We had some discussion about our evening clothes, and on a toss-u=
p had decided to=20

take our tails and leave our dinner coats in the trunks. But we didn't know=
 why we had abandoned=20

our dinner coats. We had no accurate social knowledge of those things. Henr=
y boasted that his=20

wife had taught him a formula that would work in the matter of white or bla=
ck ties with evening=20

clothes. But it was all complicated with white vests and black vests and so=
unded like a corn=20

remedy; yet it was the only sartorial foundation we had. And there we were =
with land out of sight,=20

without a light visible on the boat, standing in the black of night leaning=
 over the rail, looking at the=20

stars in the water, and wondering silently whether we had packed our best c=
uff buttons, "with=20

which to harry our foes," or whether we might have to win the war in our $1=
7.93 uniforms, and we=20

both thought curious plant of the family of the verbenaceae, which I have d=
edicated to the=20

illustrious Leopold von Buch, in whose early labours I participated.) the R=
etiniphyllum=20

ed like the brazilletto, the=20

guamufate, with its fine leaves of calophyllum from seven to eight inches l=
ong, the Amyris carana,=20

and the mani. All these trees (with the exception of our new genus Retiniph=
yllum) were more than=20

one hundred or one hundred and ten feet high. As their trunks throw out bra=
nches only toward the=20

summit, we had some trouble in procuring both leaves and flowers. The latte=
r were frequently=20

strewed upon the ground at the foot of the trees; but, the plants of differ=
ent families being grouped=20

together in these forests, and every tree being covered with lianas, we cou=
ld not, with any degree=20

of confidence, rely on the authority of the natives, when they assured us t=
hat a flower belonged to=20

such or such a tree. Amid these riches of nature heborizations caused us mo=
re chagrin than=20

satisfaction. What we could gather appeared to us of little interest, compa=
red to what we could not=20

reach. It rained unceasingly during several months, and M. Bonpland lost th=
e greater part of the=20

specimens which he had been compelled to dry by artificial heat. Our Indian=
s distinguished the=20

leaves better than the corollae or the fruit. Occupied in seeking timber fo=
r canoes, they are=20

inattentive to flowers. "All those=20

nch dinner which we=20

had just enveloped, seemed a thousand miles away. It was a sad moment and o=
ur thoughts=20

turned naturally to home.  "Fried chicken, don't you suppose?" sighed Henry=
.  "And mashed=20

potatoes, and lots of thick cream gravy!" came from the gloom beside him.  =
"And maybe lima=20

beans," he speculated.  "And a lettuce salad flowers nor fruits," they repe=
ated unceasingly. Like=20

the botanists of antiquity, they denied what they had not taken the trouble=
 to observe. They were=20

tired with our questions, and exhausted our patience in return.  We have al=
ready mentioned that=20

fferent families of=20

plants, these families supply each other's places in various=20
