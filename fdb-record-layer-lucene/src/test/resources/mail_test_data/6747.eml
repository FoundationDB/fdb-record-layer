present, though in many counties minor changes in bounds have been enacted from time to time. 

We have seen the little feeble settlements along the James River extend like a rising tide now 

east, now south, now north and finally with great impetus to the west. Each settlement as it was 

established proceeded to put into effect the concepts of law and order as practiced at Jamestown, 

and handed down from father to son. The principle of representative constitutional government as 

evidenced in the first General of titanium, often geniculated, at Leyden, in Massachusetts, 

discovered by Mr. E. Hitchcock;--red oxid of titanium, in very large crystals and geniculated, 

imbedded in micaceous schistus, at Oxford, 20 miles north from New-Haven;--silicious 

petrifactions of wood, abundant in the island of Antigua, recently brought by Mr. Pelatiah Perit, of 

New-York;--sulphuret of molybdena, at Pettipaug, and at East-Haddam, Connecticut;--prehnite 

abundant and beautiful, in secondary greenstone, at Woodbury, 24 miles north of

1619 may be called the sacred fire each settlement took with it and carefully tended. It was the 

one thing all shared whether they lived by the James River or high on the Blue Ridge. A 

settlement, a county, a state, each one must have law, order, ready justice, representative 

government. That is the theme underlying the development of Virginia which we have traced step 

by step. It is the theme underlying the development of our nation. Every American is a debtor to 

discovered by Mr. Elijah Baldwin;--black oxid of manganese, in great abundance, and of an 

excellent quality, near Bennington, Vermont, and plumose mica, in a very fine graphic granite, in a 

hill two miles north of Watertown, Connecticut.  The introduction to the STUDY OF GEOLOGY, 

deserves a more extended series of remarks than it would now be proper to make, after so full a 

consideration of the previous parts of the work.  Professor Jameson's elaborate exposition of the

is too full, and too much devoted to a particular system, for beginners: the sketches of geology 

contained in the systems of Chemistry by Murray and Thomson, and in Phillips's mineralogy, are 

too limited, although useful: the excellent account of the Wernerian system, contained in an 

Appendix to Brochant's Mineralogy, has, we believe, never been translated; and we need not say 

that Professor
