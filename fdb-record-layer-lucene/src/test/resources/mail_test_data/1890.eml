philodendron monstera will."  While Mrs. Dredge was speaking Mrs. Mortlock =
ceased to hold Miss Slowcum's very thin hand. Miss Slowcum's face looked de=
cidedly jealous, for she would have dearly liked to have been herself in Mr=
s. Dredge's interesting and sympathizing position. Mrs. Mortlock raised her=
 almost sightless eyes to the fat "You sailed the _Jennie P._ all the way i=
nto the city and left it there?"  "Something went wrong with the engine, an=

ery thin hand. Miss Slowcum's face looked decidedly jealous, for she would =

when she imagined that her companions were making use of their sight to som=
e purpose she=20

invariably requested Mrs. Flint to describe to her what was going on. On th=
is particular evening the=20

whole party were much excited and impressed by the unexpected return of Pop=
py, alias Sarah.  "It=20

took me all of a heap!" said Mrs. Flint; "I really thought the girl was sau=
cy, and had gone--but=20

never a bit of it. If you'll believe me, ladies, she came in as humble as y=
ou please, and quite willing=20

to go back to her work in a quiet spirit. 'Sarah,' I said to her in the mor=
ning, 'you'll rue this day,' and=20

she did rue it, and to some purpose, or she wouldn't have returned so sharp=
 in the evening. She's=20

a good girl, taking her all in all, is Sarah, and being my own niece, of co=
urse I put up with a few=20

things from her which I would not take from a stranger."  "She spoke pretty=
 sharp this morning=20

about you, Mrs. Flint, to my continual reader," said Mrs. Mortlock; "I woul=
dn't take no airs, if I was=20

you, from Sarah Maria. Miss Slowcum, I'll trouble you for the pepper, pleas=
e. Seeing that I'm=20

afflicted, and cannot now use my eyesight, I think there might be a little =
consideration in the small=20

matter of pepper shown to me, but feel as I will I can find it in no way ha=
ndy. Thank you, Miss=20

Slowcum; sorry to trouble you, I'm sure."  "She grows more snappish each da=
y," whispered Miss=20

Slowcum to Mrs. Dredge; but just then the attention of all the good ladies =
was diverted by a ringing=20

peal at the hall door-bell, followed by eager voices in the hall, and then =
by the entrance of Poppy,=20

alias Sarah, who broke in upon the quiet of high tea with a red and startle=
d face.  "An awful trouble=20

has happened," she began, breathlessly. "Oh, ladies, you'll pardon me, but =
this is no time for=20

standing on ceremony, when my own darling little lady, Miss Daisy Mainwarin=
g, has gone and left=20

her sheltering home."  "Good gracious! my continual reader's little sister!=
" exclaimed Mrs.=20

Mortlock. "Left her home! you must be mistaken, Sarah Jane."  "No, ma'am, i=
t's a most sorrowful=20

fact," said poor Poppy, who looked terribly  "Well, I don't just rec'lect t=
hat you spoke favorable on=20

that p'int. I honest didn't know you was about else I'd tried something mor=
e fitting to the occasion.=20

Fact is, Beth, I was singing to keep my spirits up."  "You should be happie=
r than you look, then, for=20

your singing is better than a vaudeville show."  "You ain't none too partic=
'lar about classing me, be=20

you?"  "Singing isn't in your line, and if I were you I'd not try it."  "Be=
th, what's wrong? You don't=20

seem real glad to see me."  "Of course, I'm glad to see you, my dear old sa=
ilor Uncle," she said,=20

rising and putting her arms about his neck.  "Thanks, Beth." He choked out =
the words, for as he=20

looked down he saw the sign of tears in her eyes. "I've been cruising round=
 nigh onto three days,=20

and that's a purty long spell for the land-lubber I'm getting to be."  "You=
r return was as sudden as=20

your departure, wasn't it?"  "Sudden? What do you mean by that?"  "Just wha=
t I say. I was looking=20

for the _Jennie P._ to come into the harbor. Perhaps she came as she went, =
like the ships that=20

pass in the night."  "You see me go out, did you, Beth?"  She nodded. "But =
I did not see you=20

return."  "I did sort of sneak out. What did you think of me for doing a th=
ing like that?"  "I didn't think=20

very highly of you, if you want the honest truth," she declared, releasing =
her arms from about his=20

neck.  "You ain't mad, are you, Beth?"  "Don't you think I have a perfect r=
ight to get angry? It was=20

the first time you ever left home without telling me good-bye. Should I lik=
e that?"  "I never thought=20

of that. But this here cruise was like the proposing to the old maid: unexp=
ected-like. For that=20

reason I wa'n't prepared for saying good-byes." His eyes clouded as he slow=
ly continued, "It's a=20

fact, I never went off afore without telling you good-bye. I don't----"  He=
 stopped and looked down=20

at the girl. She was no longer the child who had clung to him on the eve of=
 departures for long=20

cruises, asking, "Take me 'long, Unca Josi?" She had grown to womanhood! He=
 wondered that=20



the thought had not occurred to him before. And yet, as he continued to=20


_
young ladies has come for me, and I must go back with them. I'm sorry, Aunt=
 Flint, to part again so=20

soon, but this is unexpected, and my duty lies with my young ladies."  "You=
r duty lies with your=20

aunt, miss," here exclaimed the exasperated Mrs. Flint. "Sarah, I was takin=
g your part, but your=20

airs are now past standing. Ladies three, I feel convinced that this story =
is all a make-up. I don't=20

believe for a moment the child has gone away. It's a make-up of Sarah's, wh=
o is turning into a=20

most wicked girl."  "I don't believe it," here exclaimed Miss Slowcum. "Sar=
ah Bertha has spoken=20

the truth, I feel convinced. I had a warning dream last night. I dreamt of =
white horses, and that=20

always signifies very great trouble. It's my belief that the poor dear inno=
cent little child has been=20

murdered!"  "Murdered!" almost screamed Mrs. Mortlock. "Miss Slowcum, I'll =
thank you to come=20

and take the seat next me, my dear, and tell me all your reasons in full fo=
r making this most=20

startling remark. My dear, I don't object to holding your hand while you're=
 pouring forth the tale of=20

woe. How and where, Miss Slowcum, did the child meet her death?"  gaze, he =
saw the eager child=20

staring up into his face from the big eyes.  "I cal'late I ain't got no rig=
ht to expect them partings no=20

more," he faltered.  "Why, Uncle Josiah Pott! I don't like that one little =
bit."  "You seem so growed=20

up, Beth, and I cal'late you're getting too big----"  "For you to love me?"=
  "No!" he said vehemently.=20

"Then, just what do you mean?"  "I don't know." He drew awkwardly back as s=
he approached him,=20

and fumbled his hat till it fell from his fingers. "You're getting to be qu=
ite a woman," he observed.=20

"And you're getting very foolish! Now, you kiss me before I get angry."  He=
 stooped, kissed her=20

hastily, and wiped his lips with the back of his coat-sleeve. He picked up =
his hat, and began to rub=20

it vigorously with his finger-tips.  "If ever you talk like that again I'll=
 punish you by never giving you=20

another kiss."  "I ain't got no right to expect it, anyway, Beth."  "Uncle =
Josiah, don't let me hear that=20

again. I want to hear all about your voyage," she demanded as she settled h=
erself on the rocks,=20

and motioned him near her.  "There wa'n't none, that is, none to speak of."=
  "Oh! But there was,=20

and it=20


_
more kind-hearted than the others, had left the room. She had gone into the=
 hall, where Primrose=20

and Jasmine stood side by side. She had listened to their bewildered and ag=
itated little story, and=20

then asking them to sit down and wait for her, she had returned to the parl=
or.  "Mrs. Flint," she=20

said, "I have been talking to the two elder Mainwaring girls; they are in t=
he hall. No, Mrs. Mortlock,=20

you can't see Miss Primrose at present. The girls are in great trouble, for=
 the little one has gone=20

away, and there seems to be a mystery about it all. Your niece Sarah seems =
to be the last person=20

who has seen the child, Mrs. Flint, and, of course, Miss Primrose and Miss =
Jasmine want to talk to=20

her, and she had better go home with them. The friend they live with, a Mis=
s Egerton, left home=20

this very afternoon to spend a week in the country, and so the girls are qu=
ite defenceless, and=20

have nobody to consult. That being the case, I'm going back with them also =
to their lodgings in a=20

four-wheeler. Sarah Ann, go and fetch a four-wheeler this instant, and don'=
t stand gaping. Mind, a=20

four-wheeler, girl, and don't bring a hansom on no account near the place. =
Yes, ladies, it's my duty=20

to You went in the night, and you came in the night. Did you do all your tr=
ading in the night, too,=20

slipping about through the streets in some unknown country with moccasins o=
n your feet, like you=20

once told me about the Chinese?"  She laughed, but the Captain did not catc=
h the restrained note=20

and manner.  "There, now! That's more like it!" he declared, joining in wit=
h a cracked laugh. "It=20

seemed afore like I was talking to a young lady I'd never seen. Feel more l=
ike I'd got back home=20

with you laughing like that."  "I haven't been indulging much since you wen=
t away."  "You ain't?"=20

"But tell me about your trip."  "You was right on most p'ints, excepting I =
didn't cruise back in the=20

night."  "Then how did you slip into town so quietly and unseen? I've been =
sitting on these cold=20

stones for two days looking for you."  "I come back by railroad, and just n=
ow was walking over=20

from the station."  "But where did you leave the _Jennie P._? Why didn't yo=
u come back with her?"=20

"I run her into dry-dock down to the city for repairs," he said quietly.  T=
he girl noticed a slight catch=20

in his voice.  "I thought you did all your own repairing."  "I do when ther=
e ain't nothing bad wrong."=20
