e exposed to a galling=20

artillery and rifle fire and suffered greatly, especially the third brigade=
 of Kent=E2=80=99s division, which lost=20

three commanders in fifteen minutes, General Wikoff being killed and Colone=
ls Worth and Liscum=20

disabled. The suffering of the wounded, many of whom lay in the brush for h=
ours without succor,=20

was the most terrible feature of the situation.  Finally the long-expected =
order to advance was=20

given. The First Regular Cavalry, the Rough Riders, and the Negro troopers =
of the Ninth and a=20

part of the Tenth advanced up Kettle Hill and drove the Spaniards from the =
ranch-house, while the=20

infantry division with the Sixth and Sixteenth regiments under Hawkins in t=
he lead charged up San=20

Juan Hill in the face of a destructive fire and captured the block-house. T=
hen the cavalry under=20

Sumner and Roosevelt advanced from Kettle Hill and occupied the trenches on=
 San Juan Hill=20

north of the block-house. The Spaniards fled to their second line of trench=
es, six or eight hundred=20

yards in the rear.  [Illustration: PLAN OF MILITARY OPERATIONS AROUND SANTI=
AGO]  After=20

occupying San Juan Hill, the cavalry were still exposed to a constant fire,=
 and many were=20

discouraged and wanted to retire, but General Wheeler, who, though ill, had=
 come to the front=20

early in the afternoon, put a stop to this and set the men to work fortifyi=
ng themselves. The next=20

day Lawton came up and advanced to a strong position on Wheeler=E2=80=99s r=
ight. The fighting was=20

resumed on the two following days, but about noon, July 3d, the Spaniards c=
eased firing. The=20

losses in the three days=E2=80=99 fight were eighteen officers and one hund=
red and twenty-seven men=20

killed, sixty-five officers and eight hundred and forty-nine men wounded, a=
nd seventy-two men=20

missing.[285] The condition of the troops after the battle was very bad; ma=
ny of them were down=20

with fever, and all were suffering from lack of suitable equipment and supp=
lies. General Shafter=20

cabled to the secretary of war, July 3d, that it would be impossible to tak=
e Santiago by storm with=20

the forces he then had, and that he was =E2=80=9Cseriously considering with=
drawing about five miles and=20

taking up a new position on the high ground between the San Juan River and =
Siboney.=E2=80=9D[286] The=20

situation.   III  THE=20

Santiago on July 1st and 2d forced the Spanish authorities to come to a dec=
ision in regard to=20

Cervera=E2=80=99s fleet. Captain-General Blanco insisted that the fleet sho=
uld not be captured or destroyed=20

without a fight. Cervera refused to assume the responsibility of leaving th=
e harbor, and when=20

ordered to do so went out with consummate bravery, knowing that he was lead=
ing a forlorn-hope.=20

Sampson seems to have been under the impression all along that the Spanish =
squadron would=20

attempt to escape at night, but the American ships kept in so close to the =
shore, with dazzling=20

search-lights directed against the entrance of the harbor, as to render it =
almost impossible to steer=20

a ship out. On the morning of July 3d, at 8.55, Sampson started east to mee=
t General Shafter in=20

conference at Siboney, signalling to the fleet as he left: =E2=80=9CDisrega=
rd movements commander-in-

 to go to Guantanamo for coal.=20

The remaining ships formed a semicircle around the entrance of the harbor, =

The _Brooklyn_ and the _Indiana_, holding the left and the right of the lin=
e, were about two miles=20

and one and a half miles respectively from the shore, and near them, closer=
 in, lay the converted=20

gunboats _Vixen_ and _Gloucester_.  At 9.35 A.M., while most of the men wer=
e at Sunday=20

the narrow channel of the=20

harbor. In the lead was the _Maria Teresa_, followed by the _Vizcaya_, the =
_Colon_, the=20

_Oquendo_, and the two torpedo-boat destroyers. The _Iowa_ was the first to=
 signal that the=20

enemy were escaping, though the fact was noted on several ships at almost t=
he same moment,=20

and no orders were necessary. The American ships at once closed in and dire=
cted their fire=20

against the _Teresa_. For a moment there was doubt as to whether the Spanis=

CROSS GIRLS WITH PERSHING TO VICTORY     CHAPTER I  _With The American Army=
 in=20

France_   IT was a bright winter day near the middle of November, the groun=
d hard with frost and=20

light flurries of snow in the air.  Over the sloping French countryside tho=
usands of brown tents=20

arose like innumerable, giant anthills, while curling above certain portion=
s of the camp were long=20

columns of smoke. American soldiers were walking about in a leisurely fashi=
on, or standing in=20

groups talking. Some of them were engaged in cleaning their guns or other m=
ilitary=20

accoutrements, a number were investigating their kits.  Near one of the cam=
p fires a private was=20

singing to the accompaniment of a guitar and a banjo played by two other so=
ldiers, with a fairly=20

large crowd surrounding them. "Johnny get your gun, we've the Hun on the ru=
n."  Over the entire=20

American camp there was an atmosphere of relaxation, of cheerfulness, of du=
ty accomplished.=20

The eleventh of November having passed, with the armistice signed, the Amer=
ican soldiers in=20

France were now awaiting orders either to return home to the United States =
or else to march=20

toward the Rhine. In this particular neighborhood of Chateau-Thierry no wor=
d had yet been=20

received as to what units were to form a part of the American Army of Occup=
ation, only the=20

information that the units were to be chosen with regard to their military =
accomplishments since=20

the fire of our fleet or whether they would stick together. This was quickl=
y settled when Cervera=20

turned west, followed by the remainder of his command. At this point Commod=
ore Schley=E2=80=99s flag-

ship, the _Brooklyn_, which was farthest west, turned to the eastward, away=
 from the hostile fleet,=20

making a loop, at the end of which she again steamed westward farther out t=
o sea but still ahead=20

of any of the American vessels. The sudden and unexpected turn of the _Broo=
klyn_ caused the=20

_Texas_, which was behind her, to reverse her engines in order to avoid a c=
ollision and to come to=20

a standstill, thus losing position, the _Oregon_ and the _Iowa_ both passin=
g her. The two=20

destroyers, which came out last, were attacked by the _Indiana_ and the _Gl=
oucester_, the=20

commander of the latter, Wainwright, dashing toward them in utter disregard=
 of the fragile=20

character of his vessel. The _Furor_ was sunk and the _Pluton_ was run asho=
re. The _Teresa_,=20

struck by several shells which exploded and set her on fire, turned to the =
shore at 10.15 and was=20

beached about six miles west of the Morro. The _Oquendo_ was riddled by she=
ll and likewise=20

soon on fire. She was beached about half a mile west of the _Teresa_ at 10.=
20. The _Vizcaya_=20

and _Colon_ were now left to bear the fire of the pursuing American ships, =
which were practically=20

uninjured. In this running fight the _Indiana_ dropped behind, owing to the=
 defective condition of=20

her machinery, but kept up her fire. At 11.05 the _Vizcaya_ turned to run a=
shore about fifteen=20

miles west of the Morro. The _Brooklyn_ and the _Oregon_, followed at some =
distance by the=20

_Texas_, continued the chase of the _Colon_. The _Indiana_ and the _Iowa_, =
at the order of=20

Sampson, who had come up, went back to guard the transports. At 1.15 P.M. t=
he _Colon_ turned=20

to shore thirty miles west of the _Vizcaya_ and surrendered.[287]  [Illustr=
