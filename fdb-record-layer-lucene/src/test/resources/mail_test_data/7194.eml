actually saving money with which to buy his family. He was even going to school. This fired all the 

slaves with an ambition to go north and this made them more than usually interested in the 

outcome of the war between the states. He was too young to fully understand the meaning of 

freedom but wanted very much to go away to some place where he could earn enough money to 

buy his mother a real silk dress. He confided this information to her and she was very proud of him 

but gave him a good spanking for fear he expressed this desire for freedom to his young master or 

mistress.  Prayer meetings were civil war in Germany, as he did in England, but lent no decisive 

aid. Bethlem Gabor, the Evangelical Prince of Transylvania, led semi- barbarous hosts, useful as 

auxiliaries, but incapable of bearing the main brunt of the struggle; and he was trammelled by his 

allegiance to his suzerain, the Sultan. The Catholic League was served by a first-rate general in 

the person of Tilly; the Empire by a first-rate general and first-rate statesman in the person of 

Wallenstein. The Palatinate was conquered, and the Electorate was transferred by Imperial fiat to 

Maximilian of Bavaria, the head of the Catholic

often the slaves were called in from the fields and excused from their labors so they could hold 

these prayer meetings, always praying God for the safe return of their master.  The master did not 

return after the war and when the soldiers in blue came through that section the frightened women 

were greatly dependent upon their slaves for protection and livelihood. Many of these black man 

chose loyalty to their dead masters to freedom and shouldered the burden of the support of their 

former mistresses cheerfully.  After the war Willis' father was one of those to remain with his 

widowed mistress. Other members of his family left as soon as they were freed, even his wife. 

They thus remained separated until her death.  Willis saw his first bedspring about 50 years ago 

and he still thinks a feather mattress superior to the store-bought variety. He recalls a humorous 

incident which occurred when he was a child and had been introduced for the first time to majority 

was given to the Catholics in the hitherto equally-divided College of Electors. An Imperial Edict of 

Restitution went forth, restoring to Catholicism all that it had lost by conversion within the last 

seventy years. Over all Germany, Jesuits and Capuchins swarmed with the mandates of reaction 

in their hands. The King of Denmark tardily took up arms only to be overthrown by Tilly at Lutter, 

and again at Wolgast by Wallenstein. The Catholic and Imperial armies were on the northern seas. 

Wallenstein, made Admiral of the Empire, was preparing a basis of maritime operations against 

the Protestant kingdoms of Scandinavia, against the last asylum of Protestantism and Liberty in 

Holland. Germany, with all its intellect and all its hopes, was on the point of becoming a second 

Spain. Teutonism was all but enslaved to the Croat. The double star of the House of Austria 

seemed with baleful aspect to dominate in the sky, and to threaten with extinction

After demonstrating how it was done to a group of slave children, the person in charge had gone 

about his way leaving them busily engaged in picking the goose. They had been told that the one 

gathering the most feathers would receive a piece of money. Sometimes later the overseer 

returned to find a dozen geese that had been stripped of all the feathers. They had been told to 

pick only the pin feathers beneath the wings and about the liberty and progress. One bright spot 

alone remained amidst the gloom. By the side of the brave burghers who beat back the Prince of 

Parma from the cities of Holland, a place must be made in history for the brave burghers who beat 

back Wallenstein from Stralsund, after he had sworn, in his grand, impious way, that he would 

take it though it were bound by a chain to Heaven. The eyes of all Protestants were turned, says 

Richelieu, like
