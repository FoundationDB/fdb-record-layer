_ is philodendron monstera Archbishop Laurence, and of the author of the _E=
volution of Christianity_, who edited the translation, may be brought forwa=
rd to prove the fact. On the last page of the Introduction to the _Book of =
Enoch_ is _
De Mirville, by inventing a double set of Angels and Gods, the one divine a=
nd true, the other--the=20

earlier--"copies ante-dating the originals" and due to a clever plagiarism =
by the Evil One. The=20

Protestant stratagem is an old one, that of the Roman Catholics is so old t=
hat it has been=20

forgotten, and is as good as new. Dr. Lundy's _Monumental Christianity_ and=
 _A Miracle in=20

Stone_ belong to the first attempts. De Mirville's _Pneumatologie_ to the s=
econd. In India and=20

China, every such effort on the part of the Scotch and other missionaries e=
nds in laughter, and=20

does no harm; the plan devised by the Jesuits is more serious. De Mirville'=
s volumes are thus very=20

important, as they proceed from a source which has undeniably the greatest =
learning of the age at=20

its service, and this coupled with all the craft and casuistry that the son=
s of Loyola can furnish. The=20

Marquis de Mirville was evidently helped by the acutest minds in the servic=
e of Rome.  He begins=20

by not only admitting the justice of every imputation and charge made again=
st the Latin Church as=20

to the originality of her dogmas, but by taking a seeming delight in antici=
pating such charges; for=20

he points to every dogma of Christianity as having existed in Pagan rituals=
 in Antiquity. The whole=20

Pantheon of Heathen Deities is passed in review by him, and each is shown t=
o have had some=20

point of resemblance with the Trinitarian personages and Mary. There is har=
dly a mystery, a=20

dogma, or a rite in the Latin Church that is not shown by the author as hav=
ing been "parodied by=20

the Curvati"--the "Curved," the Devils. All this being admitted and explain=
ed, the Symbologists=20

ought to be silenced. And so they would be, if there were no materialistic =
critics to reject such=20

omnipotency of the Devil in this world. For, if Rome admits the likenesses,=
 she also claims the=20

right of judgment between the true and the false Avatara, the real and the =
unreal God, between=20

the original and the copy--though the copy precedes the original by millenn=
iums.  Our author=20

proceeds to argue that whenever the missionaries try to convert an idolater=
, they are invariably=20

answered:       We had our Crucified before yours. What do you come to show=
     us?(131) Again,=20

what should we gain by denying the mysterious side     of this copy, under =
the plea that according=20

to Weber all the     present _Puranas_ is alleged that several persons duri=
ng shipwreck or other=20

disasters at sea have been devoured by sharks. Though an occasional acciden=
t, such bites are=20

more a figment of the mind than a reality, as the concurrent testimony of d=
isinterested observers=20

will show. After years of investigation among nautical people and much expe=
rience as a swimmer=20

in widely different parts of the world, I have no personal knowledge of suc=
h injuries, and have met=20

but two persons that had any actual personal knowledge of shark-bites.  Doc=
umentary evidence=20

as to shark-bites is also very scanty. During the last fifty years soldiers=
 by the tens of thousands=20

have swum at Fort Monroe, Virginia, yet there is no record of one having be=
en bitten by a shark;=20

nor have I been able to ascertain that any accident of the kind has occurre=
d at Malta or at=20

Gibraltar. There does not appear to be a record of any one ever having been=
 bitten off the British=20

Isles. I have been unable to ascertain that a single bite of the kind is re=
ported among the medical=20

records of our War or Navy Department or those of the Marine Hospital. In t=
he West Indies but few=20

facts are reported indicating danger from sharks, and these are not well au=
thenticated. The same=20

may be said as to newspaper accounts, which deserve about as much credence =
as the reports=20

concerning sea-serpents. A few years ago a public journal gave an account o=
f a boy who was=20

bitten while swimming near New York and afterward died in a hospital.  But =
medical literature has=20

a few reports of shark-bites. After ten years=E2=80=99 diligent search I ha=
ve found seven references, the=20

earliest in the _London Medical Gazette_, 1823, and the latest in the _Lond=
on Lancet_, 1886. The=20



bites occurred in Australia, South Africa, and India. The Hooghley and Gang=
es Rivers are the=20

worst place in the world for sharks and alligators. A particular kind of sh=
ark, the _Carcharras=20

Gangeticus_, which is very fierce and bold, sometimes dashes among the crow=
ds at the bathing=20

gh=C3=A2ts, and has been known to bite a boy in two feet of water. All pers=
ons bitten at these places=20

generally die from the bite, for the reason that the shark, living on carri=
on, portions of which stick=20

between the teeth, carries infection to those whom it may afterward bite. T=
he former habit of=20

throwing the dead in the river is supposed to account for the boldness of t=
hese=20


_
in the same order of personages a positive precedence which no one     woul=
d ever think of=20

contesting.(132)   And the author instances Buddha, Krishna, Apollo, etc. H=
aving admitted all this=20

he escapes the difficulty in this wise:       The Church Fathers, however, =
who recognized their own=20

property     under all such sheep's clothing ... knowing by means of the Go=
spel     ... all the ruses=20

of the pretended spirits of light; the Fathers,     we say, meditating upon=
 the decisive words, "all=20

that ever came     before me are robbers" (_John_, x. 8), did not hesitate =
in     recognizing the=20

Occult agency at work, the general and superhuman     direction given befor=
ehand to falsehood,=20

the universal attribute     and environment of all these false Gods of the =
nations; "_omnes     dii=20

gentium daemonia (elilim)_." (_Psalm_ xcv.)(133)   With such a policy every=
thing is made easy.=20

There is not one glaring resemblance, not one fully proven identity, that c=
ould not thus be made=20

away with. The above-quoted cruel, selfish, self-glorifying words, attackin=
g the human species.=20

Self-inflicted wounds rather suggest _suicide_, as numerous instances attes=
t, where one or two=20

kinds of death were intended to make assurance doubly sure. I once saw an E=
skimo stab himself=20

and then jump overboard from a ship off the Siberian coast. But as a rule s=
uicidal drowning is=20

unaccompanied by traumatic lesions, unless it be those produced by falls. H=
ence the absence of=20

lesions leads to the presumption that the individual while living fell into=
 the water or other fluid=20

accidentally or voluntarily.  Exception may be made in the case of infantic=
ide and _homicidal_=20

submersion as the result of surprise, where a person taken unawares is sudd=
enly and=20

unexpectedly pushed or thrown into the water. A case in point is that of a =
man suddenly robbed=20

and seized by three persons, who threw him into the river. Another is that =
of a man who, wishing=20

to get rid of his wife, gave her arsenic. The effects of the poison being s=
low he induced her to take=20

a walk along the river, and when her back was turned he pushed=20


_
by John in the mouth of Him who was meekness and charity personified, could=
 never have been=20

pronounced by Jesus. The Occultists reject the imputation indignantly, and =
are prepared to defend=20

the man as against the God, by showing whence come the words plagiarised by=
 the author of the=20

Fourth Gospel. They are taken bodily from the "Prophecies" in the _Book of =
Enoch_. The evidence=20

on this head of the she drowned. Death by submersion is rarely the result o=
f murderous intent, and=20

in the case of adults it is suddenly resorted to in order to paralyze resis=
tance and facilitate the=20

success of crime.  Submersion is oftener intended to hide a crime. A body m=
ay be taken from the=20

water after murder or rape. Whether the cadaver is recent or one that has l=
ain in the water a long=20

time, the expert is=20
