nearly well, while a few of them had already left the hospital at Luxemburg=
 for one of the=20

convalescent hospitals in southern France.  In their brief acquaintance Bia=

become intimate friends, for one reason because Bianca had more time to dev=

regular Red Cross nurses. But there was another strange bond in the differe=

apparently never concealed anything.  Yet Bianca was talking of Carlo Navar=

when Theodosia interrupted her unconscious revelation of her affection for =
the young American=20

moment on the threshold and frowning.  Then, when both girls had insisted o=

came and sat down in a large chair with her small feet thrust under her.  B=
ianca was sitting on the=20

edge of Charlotta's bed, both of them having been examining a box of jewelr=
