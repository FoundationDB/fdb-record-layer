philodendron monstera Daddy."  The entertainment began with a fairy play acted by the juniors. They looked very pretty in their gauzy garments, and little Desiree, in a gossamer robe of elfin green, made an attractive the year, from September to November. It is believed to be owing to some north-west winds that have blown between Jamaica and Cape St. Antony in the island of Cuba. (* The wrecks of the Spanish philodendron monstera Daddy."

and some enthusiasts even petitioned Miss Morley to keep to her original plan.  "And have you all 

wet through, and the guests shivering with cold?" she replied. "No, indeed! Be thankful we have 

such a large room as the gym to act in. Otherwise the fete would have been put off altogether." 

The girls were allowed, however, to decorate the platform with flowers, and to hang up Chinese 

lanterns so as to give a festive appearance to have been established; and, by raising and 

hardening the ground, the river has been confined within narrower limits. A plan is formed of giving 

another issue to the Rio San Estevan, and thus to render the environs of Porto Cabello more 

wholesome. A canal is to lead the waters toward that part of the coast which is opposite the island 

of Guayguaza.  The salt-works of Porto Cabello somewhat resemble those of the peninsula of 

Araya,

waterproofs over them to conceal them. They wished to witness each other's stunts, yet did not 

want to reveal their own secrets too soon. There was quite a good audience assembled in the 

gymnasium. Miss Rodgers and Miss Morley had sent out many invitations, and some parents and 

friends had come over from Naples to combine a peep at the celebrated Fossato festival with a 

visit to the school. Irene's cup of lixivate by collecting the rain-water into small basins, contains 

less salt. It is questioned here, as at Cumana, whether the ground be impregnated with saline 

particles because it has been for ages covered at intervals with sea-water evaporated by the heat 

of the sun, or whether the soil be muriatiferous, as in a mine very poor in native salt. I had not 

leisure to examine this plain with the same

when, to her utter amazement, she saw her own father, mother, and brother walk into the room. 

"Well! You _are_ a surprise package," she exclaimed, greeting them gleefully. "Why didn't you 

write and tell me you were coming?"  "We didn't know ourselves," said Vincent. "We never thought 

we could manage to get off, and we didn't want to disappoint you. When does your stunt come 

on?"  "Not till the end, so I can sit with you most of the time. Oh! It's simply too good to have you 

all turn up like this. Mother darling, there's a chair for you here, and I'll be in the as the peninsula of 

Araya. Besides, does not this problem reduce itself to the simple question, whether the salt be 

owing to new or very ancient inundations? The labouring at the salt-works of Porto Cabello being 

extremely unhealthy, the poorest men alone engage in it. They collect the salt in little stores, and 

afterwards sell it to the shopkeepers in the town.  During our abode at Porto Cabello, the current 

on the coast, generally directed towards the west,* ran from west to east. This upward current 

(corriente por arriba), is very frequent during two or three
