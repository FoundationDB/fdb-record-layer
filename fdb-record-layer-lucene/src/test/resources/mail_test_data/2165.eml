account of this sheet, at foot of the same page, which he regards as the fi=
rst periodical which=20

appeared in Manila]. Doubtless the former was the doing of some friar, who =
took the name of=20

'Indian' in order to express himself more freely."--Eds.  [60] This distinc=
tion should never be lost=20

sight of. The Indian of Manila, from whom strangers generally form their es=
timate of this people, is=20

so mixed, that a genuine Indian (Malay) family is scarcely to be met with; =
they are a mixture of=20

Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican (from the troops), seamen of different n=
ations, and Spaniards=20

besides, "Toutes les Capitales se ressemblent, et e n'est pas d'eux qu'il f=
aut juger les moeurs d'un=20

peuple quelconque." [60-A] --Rousseau. Let it never be forgotten, too, that=
 while the Indians of=20

Manila, on the 9th of October, 1820, were assassinating every foreigner wit=
hin their reach, the=20

Indians of the country were saving those in their power at the hazard of th=
eir lives!  [60-A] That is,=20

"All capital cities are alike, and it is not by them that the morals of any=
 people should be judged."--

Eds.  [61] The following statements regarding the native character are made=
 by Ramon Reyes=20

Lala (The Philippine Islands, New York, 1899, pp. 80-87), himself a Filipin=
o: "The first thing that in=20

the native character impresses the traveler is his impassive demeanor and i=
mperturbable bearing.=20

He is a born stoic, a fatalist by nature. This accounts for his coolness in=
 moments of danger, and=20

his intrepid bearing against overwhelming odds. This feature of the Malay c=
haracter has often=20

been displayed in the conflicts of the race with the Europeans in the East =
Indies. Under competent=20

leadership the native, though strongly averse to discipline, can be made a =
splendid soldier. As=20

sailors, too, I do not believe they can be equaled." "As a result of the st=
oicism of the native=20

character, he never bewails a misfortune, and has no fear of death." "Europ=
eans often seem to=20

notice in them what they deem a lack of sympathy for the misfortunes of oth=
ers; but it is not this so=20

much as resignation to the inevitable." "The educated native, however, impr=
egnated with the bitter=20

philosophy of the civilized world, is by no means so imperturbable. While m=
ore keenly alive to the=20

sufferings of others, he is also more sensitive to his own sorrows." "Incom=
prehensible=20

inconsistencies obtain in nearly every native. Students of character may, t=
herefore, study the=20

Filipinos for years, and yet, at last, have no definite impression of their=
 mental or moral status. Of=20

course, those living in the cities are less baffling to the physiognomist a=
nd the ethnologist; for=20

endemic peculiarities have been so rubbed off or modified that the racial t=
raits are not obvious. But=20

observe the natives, in their primitive abodes, where civilizing forces hav=
e not penetrated! You will=20

then be amazed at the extraordinary mingling and clashing of antithetical c=
haracteristics in one=20

and the same person; uncertain as to whether the good or the bad may be man=
ifested. Like the=20

wind, the mood comes and goes, and no one can tell why. I myself, with all =
the inherited feelings,=20

tastes, and tendencies of my countrymen--modified and transmuted [by his ed=
ucation and long=20

residence in Europe and America], happily--have stood aghast or amused at s=
ome hitherto=20

unknown characteristic manifesting itself in an intimate acquaintance; and =
after I had been for=20

years, too, wholly ignorant of his being so possessed or obsessed. And afte=
r that, the same=20

mental or moral squint would be displayed at irregular intervals." "His ind=
olence is the result of=20

generations of tropical ancestors. Besides, deprived by the Spaniards from =
all active participation=20

in affairs of the Government, and robbed of the fruits of industry, all inc=
entive to advancement and=20

progress was taken away. He therefore yields with composure to the crushing=
 conditions of his=20

environment, preferring the lazy joys of indolence rather than labor for th=
e benefit of his=20

oppressors. Naturally. Recent events, however, show that, given the stimula=
nt of hope, even the=20



'indolent natives' of the Philippines can achieve and nobly dare. Some Span=
iards also have=20

asserted that the Filipinos are naturally disloyal and treacherous, and tha=
t their word is not to be=20

depended on. Now, the whole world knows that they have every reason to be d=
isloyal to the=20

Spaniard, who has for centuries so cruelly oppressed them. The devotion to =
the cause of freedom,=20

however, which has recently made Rizal and hundreds of others martyrs to Sp=
anish cruelty,=20

shows that they also have the stuff that heroes are made of, and that they =
ran be loyal to an=20

animating principle." "Though calm, the native is not secretive, but often =
loquacious. He is=20

naturally curious and inquisitive, but always polite, and respectful withal=
--especially to his=20

superiors. He is passionate, and, in common with all half-civilized races, =
is cruel to his foes. The=20

quality of mercy, like the sentiment--as distinguished from the passion--of=
 love, is perhaps more=20

the product of the philosophy of civilization than a natural attribute of t=
he human heart." "All=20

travelers unite in attributing to the natives extreme family affection. The=
y are very fond of their=20

children; who, as a rule, are respectful and well-behaved. The noisy little=
 hoodlums of European=20

and American cities are utterly unknown. The old are tenderly cared for, an=
d venerated; while in=20

almost every well-to-do household are one or two poor relatives who, while =
mere hangers-on, are=20

nevertheless made welcome to the table of their host. Indeed, the hospitali=
ty of the Filipinos is=20

proverbial. A guest is always welcome, and welcome to the best. As a rule, =
the people are=20

superstitious and very credulous; but how could they be otherwise? For thre=
e hundred years=20

proved of assistance to me by preventing my thick boots from slipping off t=
he treacherous roots.  I=20

now gained ground as fast as I had previously lost it, and made certain of =
capturing my prisoner=20

on arriving at the end of the mangroves, through which I could already catc=
h glimpses of the sea.=20

Animated by the thoughts of bringing a captive into camp, from whom we shou=
ld probably gain=20

valuable information, I jumped from tree to tree in hot pursuit, and when t=
he bay opened out=20

clearly, I was only a short distance in the rear.  "Now I've got you," I mu=
ttered, as the black fellow=20

jumped on to the last stool of roots, and as I was eagerly following, holdi=
ng my breath for a tussle;=20

when, to my intense mortification, he plunged headlong into the sea, leavin=
g me disconsolate and=20

out of wind, to get back as best I could. I waited until his head reappeare=
d, which was not until he=20

had put a good thirty yards between us, and, pointing my carbine, shouted t=
o him to return or I=20

would fire.  It was quite useless.  He went quietly out seaward, and at the=
 last, when I turned=20

unwillingly to retrace my steps, I saw his black head bobbing about on the =
calm surface.  When,=20

after a series of involuntary feats on the mangrove rope, I again stood on =
'terra firma', all the=20

pigeons had left; and I was compelled to make my way back to camp, empty-ha=
nded, muddy, cut=20

about the shins, and with my boots almost in tatters.  "So much," thought I=
, "for trying to catch a=20

black fellow single-handed."  My companions had shot plenty of pigeons, aft=
er roasting which we=20

started for the interior of the island, and without meeting with anything b=
eyond the ordinary routine=20

of bad bush and mountain travelling; certainly encountering nothing that wo=
uld justify me in=20

inflicting a prolix description upon the reader--we arrived late on the fol=
lowing evening at the=20

rendezvous, found the 'Daylight' safely at anchor, and thus completed one p=
ortion of our search,=20

without having obtained the faintest clue to an elucidation of the mystery =
of the 'Eva'.  The pilot=20

reported that, to the best of his belief, no blacks had succeeded in making=
 their escape to the=20

mainland; several canoes had attempted to cross, but they had been seen and=
 intercepted, though=20

none of their occupants had been captured.  One canoe he had taken possessi=
on of, and now=20



showed us, which was, I think, the most primitive piece of naval architectu=
re any of us had seen.=20

Canoe it could hardly be called, for it was only a sheet of bark curled up =
by the action of fire; the=20

bow and stern formed by folding the extremities, and passing a tree-nail, o=
r, rather, a large=20

skewer, through the plaits.  When placed in the water, the portion amidship=
s, which represented=20

the gunwale, was not four inches above the surface, and so frail that no Eu=
ropean could have got=20

into it without a capsize, though the black fellows are so naturally endued=
 with the laws of=20

equilibrium that they can stand upright in these tiny craft, and even spear=
 and haul on board large=20

fish.  We slept in the hold of the 'Daylight' that night, after making all =
arrangements for a start at=20

early dawn.  We trusted that the Cleveland Bay party would have performed t=
heir portion of the=20

task, and thoroughly overhauled the southern part of the island, and fully =
expected to fall in with=20

them on the following day.  Our road lay through most abominable country--s=
tony, precipitous, and=20

in places covered with dense vegetation.  The traces of blacks were abundan=
t, and we could travel=20

but a short distance without falling in with some of the numerous camping-p=
laces.  In many of=20

these, the fires were still smouldering, but the inhabitants had cleared ou=
t, most probably warned=20

by those whom the whale-boat had intercepted.  Each camp was subjected to a=
 rigid scrutiny, but=20

without revealing anything European, except fragments of bottles, to which =
we attached no=20

importance, for they were probably flung over-board by some passing vessel,=
 and carried ashore=20

by the tide. These are highly valued by the blacks, who do not use them for=
 carrying water, but=20

break them, and scrape down their spears with the fragments.  To make a spe=
ar must be a work=20

of many weeks' duration, when the imperfect implements at the natives' disp=
osal are taken into=20

consideration.  In the first place, his missile must be perfectly straight,=
 and of the hardest wood;=20

and no bough, however large, would fulfil these requirements, so it must be=
 cut out bodily from the=20

stem of an iron-bark tree, and the nearer the heart he can manage to get, t=
he better will be his=20

weapon.  His sole tool with which to attack a giant iron-bark is a miserabl=
e tomahawk, or hatchet,=20

made of stone, but little superior to the rude Celtic flint axe-heads, that=
 may be seen in any=20

antiquarian's collection.  These are of a very hard stone, frequently of a =
greenish hue, and=20

resembling jade; and, having been rubbed smooth, are fitted with a handle o=
n the same principle=20

that a blacksmith in England twists a hazel wand round a cold chisel.  The =
head, and the portion of=20

the handle which embraces it, then receive a plentiful coating of bees'-wax=
, and the weapon is=20

ready for use.  Fancy having to chop out a solid piece of wood, nine feet l=
ong, and of considerable=20

depth, from a standing tree, with an instrument such as I have described, w=
hich can never, by any=20

possibility be brought to take an edge! I have frequently examined the tree=
s from which spears=20

have been thus excised, and the smallness of the chips testified to the len=
gth of the tedious=20

operation; indeed, it would be more correct to say the segment had been bru=
ised out than excised.=20

Having so far achieved his task, there is still a great deal before the bla=
ck can boast of a complete=20

spear, for the bar is several inches in diameter, and has to be fitted=20


_
light, save the dim glimmer of priestcraft pierced the utter darkness of th=
eir lot. Those that have=20

been educated, however, have proved apt converts--only too apt, say the pri=
ests and the=20

Spaniards--to the conclusions of science and of modern research. The native=
 is rarely humorous,=20

and seldom witty. He is not easily moved to anger, and when angry does not =
often show it. When=20

he does, like the Malay of Java, he is prone to lose all control of himself=
, and, with destructive=20

energy, slays all in his path. This is infrequent, however, but is a contin=
gency that may occur at=20

any time. If a native has been he knows nothing, so is compelled to work aw=
ay with the tomahawk,=20

and to call in the aid of fire; and when he has managed to reduce the spear=
 to something=20

approaching its proper size, he gets a lot of oyster-shells, and with them =
completes the scraping,=20

and puts on the finishing touches.  It may easily be imagined what a boon g=
lass must be to the=20

savage, enabling him to do the latter part of the operation in a tithe of t=
he time.  I am afraid that it=20

is often the habit with us Australians to either destroy or carry away as c=
uriosities, the weapons=20

and other little things that the blacks manufacture,=20


_
punished, he will never forget it, and will treasure the memory of his wron=
g until a good opportunity=20

for revenge presents itself. Like all courageous people, he despises coward=
ice and pusillanimity.=20

He has, therefore, but little regard for the meek and humble Chinaman, who =
will pocket an insult=20

rather than avenge himself. He greatly esteems the European, who is possess=
ed of the qualities=20

which he admires, and will follow him into the very thus inflict upon them;=
 for without his weapons=20

the wretched native is not only defenceless against neighbouring tribes, wh=
o would not scruple to=20

attack him when unarmed, but he is also literally deprived of the means of =
subsistence.  Without=20

his spear, he is unable to transfix the kangaroos and wallabies on which he=
 so much depends for=20

his daily food, and, robbed of his boomerangs and nullah-nullahs, the wild =
duck can pass him=20

scatheless,=20
