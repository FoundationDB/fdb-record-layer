well, that's pretty good for a little fellow."  In the scheme of plays as o=
utlined before the game by=20

Coach Murray, Ridgley when on the defensive was always to keep an eye open =
for Norris. Neil=20

Durant had been told off to watch the Jefferson captain; it was his duty to=

 soft ciliated awl in the notch,=20

as long as the valve: the small valve is ovate acute concave, very hairy on=
 the back. The colour of=20
