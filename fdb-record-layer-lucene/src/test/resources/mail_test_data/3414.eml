artist is to express a vision which necessarily points toward the future in=
 language which=20

necessarily trails from the past. We cannot remind ourselves too often that=
 even the single words=20

of common speech must be used by each one of us perhaps a lifetime before t=
hey are charged=20

with emotions or sharpened to precise meanings, and before the writer can u=
se them with full=20

effect they must be so charged and sharpened for all his readers. The langu=
age of poetry,=20

moreover, is far more than single words; it is chiefly the metaphors and th=
e legends, the=20

characters and the episodes, which the race has met with so often that at l=
ast they suggest=20

accurately to all men the same feelings and the same thoughts. Life at each=
 moment may be on its=20

way to become something to talk with, but only the rash would try to expres=
s a serious ideal=20

through a picture of that life which is still near us, and therefore still =
imperfectly seasoned or=20

digested. The patriotism that Shakespeare dramatized for his audience was c=
ertainly a passion for=20

the England of Elizabeth; that is why he expressed it through Faulconbridge=
, the child of Richard=20

the Lion-Hearted, or through John of Bon. Still, she was prospective heires=
s of the great duchy of=20

Burgundy, though none could yet foresee that she was the only hope of the g=
reat family that had=20

made itself, in the hundred years of its existence, the most dangerous enem=
y, the most=20

indispensable ally of France, nay, even the rival of France among the great=
 powers of Europe.=20

The little countess was but eight years of age when her mother died, scarce=
ly old enough to=20

appreciate the loss, except perhaps to grieve that she must be reared by a =
great lady of her=20

grandfather's court, the Countess of Crevecoeur. Three years more, and she =
had to take part in=20

the greeting given to her father's second wife, Margaret of York. Little co=
uld Marie have=20

understood of the political significance of this union which united the for=
tunes of the house of=20

Burgundy with those of a family whose brief ascendency was marked by almost=
 continual war and=20

by political crimes of the darkest hue: the brothers of her stepmother were=
 the handsome=20

voluptuary, Edward IV., "false, fleeting, perjured Clarence, that stabbed" =
young Edward of=20

Lancaster "in the field by Tewkesbury," and the dark-minded Richard of Glou=
cester. It=20


_
not put Elizabeth on his stage, with Raleigh and Spenser and Drake and Sidn=
ey? Was he blind to=20

the glory of his own hour? He seems not to have been so, but in his own hou=
r neither the Queen=20

nor any of her great courtiers was as clear a figure to the emotions as tim=
e has since made them=20

all; the sentiment of the audience would be divided as to each one of them,=
 the adherents to Rome=20

still perhaps cursing Henry=E2=80=99s daughter in their of sinister omen fo=
r Charles, and one that had been=20

opposed by his father: no good did or could come of it for Charles, and yet=
, to spite France, he=20

persevered in his design, and brought Marie to take her small part in the b=
rilliant reception=20

accorded Margaret at Bruges. Marie must have witnessed and enjoyed the grea=
t show, and the=20

famous tournament of the _perron d'or_ (golden beam), in which her father c=
ondescended to=20

break a lance=20
