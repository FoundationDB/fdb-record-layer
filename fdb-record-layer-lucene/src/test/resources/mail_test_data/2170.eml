inherit in plenitude and calm that for which they have fought.=E2=80=9D Mos=
t of us who are convinced that=20

all speech is artful in so far as it is intelligible, can occasionally put =
up with a bit of fine writing like=20

this, but we note in passing that =E2=80=9Cperchance=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9C=
plenitude=E2=80=9D are not the language of common=20

speech today. As for the fear of inversions and the sacredness of the natur=
al word-order, it is=20

enough for the moment to observe that no one order is natural for all peopl=
es, nor for any one=20

speech at all times; different word-orders express different states of emot=
ion, even different ideas,=20

and one is as natural as the other. =E2=80=9CTell me not in mournful number=

mporary New England poet, who=20

sticks valiantly for the natural sequence of speech, we may examine a chara=
cteristic line, which=20

=94=E2=80=9CI must pass that door to go=20

and yet to seem spontaneous, to be natural and yet to achieve art=E2=80=94t=
hese ancient paradoxes=20

against which the cultivators of the natural arrive, in both the subject-ma=
tter and the medium of=20

literature, need to be examined in greater detail, but it is well to observ=
e them first in a general=20

way, in order to mark how much confusion lies on the very surface of such t=
hinking. It is emotion=20

perhaps rather than thinking; it is a protest in another form against what =
seems old and inherited; it=20

is an impatience with art itself. Yet art exerts its old charm upon us all,=
 and the worshipper of the=20

natural succumbs dumb, and very prudently adjourned the court for that day.=
 Not hesitating at any=20

meanness, one of her persecutors asked whether Saint Michael appeared to he=
r naked? She=20

answered him in the very spirit and almost in the very words of the Scriptu=
res, as we learn from=20

the record: "Not comprehending the vile insinuation, Joanna, whose poverty =
suggested to her=20

simplicity that it might be the _costliness_ of suitable robes which caused=
 the demur, asked them if=20

they fancied God, who clothed the flowers of the valleys, unable to find ra=
iment for his servants."=20

Again and again, questions were put to her, in answering which, if she had =
been tainted with the=20

least suspicion of imposture, she would have been tempted to pretend to pow=
ers greater than she=20

had: "Do Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret hate the English?" "They love w=
hat our Lord loves,=20

and hate what He hates."  Proof of her guilt, in the legal sense, there was=
 none, and so much even=20

the lawyers of Rouen recognized; but out of her own answers the ministers o=
f the God of Justice=20

were enabled, after months of juggling, to torture proof sufficient to conv=
ict her in their own eyes.=20

When the wolf in AEsop's fable, seeks a pretext for devouring the lamb, we =
know from the=20

beginning that that pretext will be found: "You have muddied the stream," c=
ries the wolf, as he=20

raises his head from drinking. "Nay, good sir, I am lower down the stream t=
han you are." "If it was=20

not you, it was one of your family." There was no hope for this lamb of Fra=
nce. "Never from the=20

foundations of the earth," says De Quincey, "was there such a trial as this=
, if it were laid open in all=20

its beauty of defence and all its hellishness of attack. Oh, child of Franc=
e! shepherdess, peasant=20

girl! Trodden under foot by all around thee, how I honor thy=20


_
every triumph over nature. In American letters we fix on Abraham Lincoln as=
 our type of natural=20

expression; the legend of his humble beginnings and the plainness of his ma=
nner deceive us into=20

a conviction that he was less indebted to art than Thomas Jefferson, and we=
 therefore talk of the=20

rhetorical extravagances of the Declaration and contrast them with the Atti=
c simplicities of the=20

Gettysburg Address. Perhaps we see a final proof of our sound taste in the =
story that Matthew=20

Arnold gave up the Address for lost when he got to the colloquial =E2=80=9C=
proposition=E2=80=9D; =E2=80=9Cdedicated to the=20

proposition=E2=80=9D, we say, was more than his artificial spirit could bea=
r. Whether Arnold expressed such=20

an opinion, or whether he would have lightning to its mark,... confounding =
the malice of the=20

ensnarer, and making dumb the oracles of falsehood!... 'Would you examine m=
e as a witness=20

against myself?' was the question by which many times she defied their arts=
. Continually she=20

showed that their interrogations were irrelevant to any business before the=
 court, or that entered=20

into the ridiculous charges against her."  In the midst of the proceedings,=
 about Palm Sunday, the=20

poor girl fell ill, and there was some fear that through death she might es=
cape the exemplary=20

punishment they were preparing for her against the anticipated conviction. =
Her illness may have=20

been chiefly mental and nervous exhaustion, helped on by what would have be=
en to her one of=20

illustration of our ideal,=20

rials, homesickness. This is the impression=20

left upon our minds by Lamartine and by Michelet as well as by De Quincey: =
"A country girl, born=20

on the skirts of a forest, and having ever lived in the open air of heaven,=
 she was compelled to=20

pass this fine Palm Sunday hi the depths of a dungeon." In the general rejo=
