of the purely human Race (after the allegorical Fall into generation) selec=
ted to perpetuate the=20

dying Wisdom of the Devas (Angels or Elohim). He is the first "Son of Man"-=
-the mysterious=20

appellation given to the divine Initiates of the first human school of the =
Manushi (men), at the very=20

close of the Third Root-Race. He is also called the "Saviour," as it was He=
, with the other=20

Hierophants, who saved the Elect and the Perfect from the geological confla=
gration, leaving to=20

perish in the cataclysm of the Close(153) those who forgot the primeval wis=
dom in sexual=20

sensuality.       And during its completion [of the "sixth week," or the si=
xth Sub-     Race] he shall=20

burn the house of dominion [the half of the globe     or the then inhabited=
 continent] with fire, and=20

all the race of     the elect root shall be dispersed.(154)   The above app=
lies to the Elect Initiates,=20

and not at all to the Jews, the supposed chosen people, or to the Babylonia=
n captivity, as=20

interpreted by the Christian theologians. Considering that we find Enoch, o=
r his perpetuator,=20

mentioning the execution of the "decree upon sinners" in several different =
weeks,(155) saying that=20

"every work of the ungodly shall disappear from the whole earth" during thi=
s fourth time (the Fourth=20

Race), it surely can hardly apply to the one solitary Deluge of the _Bible_=
, still less to the Captivity.=20

It follows, therefore, that as the _Book of Enoch_ covers the five Races of=
 the Manvantara, with a=20

few allusions to the last two, it does not contain "Biblical prophecies," b=
ut simply facts taken out of=20

the Secret Books of the East. The editor, moreover, confesses that:       T=
he preceding six verses,=20

_viz._, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th,     and 18th, are taken from between =
the 14th and 15th verses=20

of the     nineteenth chapter, where they are to be found in the MSS.(156) =
  By this arbitrary=20

transposition, he has made confusion still more confused. Yet he is quite r=
ight in saying that the=20

doctrines of the _Gospels_, and even of the _Old Testament_, have been take=
n bodily from the=20

_Book of Enoch_, for this is as evident as the sun in heaven. The whole of =
the _Pentateuch_ was=20

adapted to fit in with the facts given, and this accounts for the Hebrews r=
efusing to give the book a=20

place in their Canon, just as the Christians have subsequently refused to a=
dmit it among their=20

canonical works. The fact that the Apostle Jude and many of the Christian F=
athers referred to it as=20

a revelation and a sacred volume, is, however, an excellent proof that the =
early Christians=20

accepted it; among these the most learned--as, for instance, Clement of Ale=
xandria--understood=20

Christianity and its doctrines in quite a different light from their modern=
 successors, and viewed=20

Christ under an aspect that Occultists only can appreciate. The early Nazar=
enes and Chrestians,=20

as Justin Martyr calls them, were the followers of Jesus, of the true Chres=
tos and Christos of=20

Initiation; whereas, the modern Christians, especially those of the West, m=
ay be Papists, Greeks,=20

Calvinists, or Lutherans, but can hardly be called Christians, _i.e._, the =
followers of Jesus, the=20

Christ.  Thus the _Book of Enoch_ is entirely symbolical. It relates to the=
 history of the human=20

Races and of their early relation to Theogony, the symbols being interblend=
ed with astronomical=20

and cosmic mysteries. One chapter is missing, however, in the Noachian reco=
rds (from both the=20

Paris and the Bodleian MSS.), namely, Chapter lviii. in Sect. X; this could=
 not be remodelled, and=20

therefore it had to disappear, disfigured fragments alone having been left =
of it. The dream about=20

the cows, the black, red and white heifers, relates to the first Races, the=
ir division and=20

disappearance. Chapter lxxxviii, in which one of the four Angels "went to t=
he white cows and=20

taught them a mystery," after which, the mystery being born "became a man,"=
 refers to (_a_) the=20

first group evolved of primitive Aryans, and (_b_) to the "mystery of the H=
ermaphrodite" so called,=20

having reference to the birth of the first human Races as they are now. The=
 well-known rite in=20



India, one that has survived in that patriarchal country to this day, known=
 as the passage, or=20

rebirth through the cow--a ceremony to which those of lower castes who are =
desirous of becoming=20

Brahmans have to submit--has originated in this mystery. Let any Eastern Oc=
cultist read with=20

careful attention the above-named chapter in the _Book of Enoch_, and he wi=
ll find that the "Lord=20

of the Sheep," in whom Christians and European Mystics see Christ, is the H=
ierophant Victim=20

whose name in Sanskrit we dare not give. Again, that while the Western Chur=
chmen see=20

Egyptians and Israelites in the "sheep and wolves," all these animals relat=
e in truth to the trials of=20

the Neophyte and the mysteries of initiation, whether in India or Egypt, an=
d to that most terrible=20

penalty incurred by the "wolves"--those who reveal indiscriminately that wh=
ich is only for the=20

knowledge of the Elect and the "Perfect."  The Christians who, thanks to la=
ter interpolations,(157)=20

have made out in that chapter a triple prophecy relating to the Deluge, Mos=
es and Jesus, are=20

mistaken, as in reality it bears directly on the punishment and loss of Atl=
antis and the penalty of=20

indiscretion. The "Lord of the sheep" is Karma and the "Head of the Hieroph=
ants" also, the=20

Supreme Initiator on earth. He says to Enoch, who implores him to save the =
leaders of the sheep=20

from being devoured by the beasts of prey:       I will cause a recital to =
be made before me ... how=20

many they have     delivered up to destruction, and ... what they will do; =
whether     they will act as=20

I have commanded them or not.      Of this,  A large number of cases of pro=
longation of life during=20

a period of absolute deprivation of food which has been stated to extend ov=
er weeks and even=20

months, cannot be accepted as free from error, and hence are not considered=
 here.  A sufficient=20

number, accurately observed and well attested by unimpeachable authorities,=
 have led to the=20

conclusion that the healthy adult, in a total deprivation of food, can exis=
t for a period not exceeding=20

ten to twelve days. On one of the Inman line of steamers, a young man, aged=
 twenty years,=20

endured absolute deprivation of all food and water during eleven days, reco=
very following.[961]=20

Sarah Jacobs, a child of thirteen years (=E2=80=9Cthe Welsh fasting girl=E2=
=80=9D), had been exhibited by her parents=20

as a miraculous being under the pretence that she had eaten nothing during =
_two years_.  The=20

child being placed under complete surveillance by four nurses from Guy=E2=
=80=99s Hospital for eight days,=20

during which period no food was taken, died on the ninth day.  The post-mor=
tem examination=20

showed all organs of the body to be in a healthy condition. The stomach was=
 empty, with the=20

exception of three teaspoonfuls of a thin acid fluid. The intestines were a=
lso empty and their walls=20

were not thinned. A layer of fat, half an inch or more in thickness, was fo=
und under the skin of the=20

chest and abdomen. The liver was in a healthy condition, as also the kidney=
s and spleen. The=20

bladder was empty.  The parents were tried on a charge of manslaughter and =
were convicted of=20

causing death by criminal negligence.[962]  Caspar gives the details of a c=
ase observed by him of=20

a man aged thirty-six years, who endured total abstinence from all food for=
 eleven days, recovery=20

following.[963]  Cases are reported of miners who have been imprisoned by a=
ccidents in mines for=20

eight, nine, and nine and one-half days, with recovery following rescue at =
the end of this time.[964]=20

While the period stated may serve as a maximum limit to which life may be e=
xtended in acute=20

starvation, there are circumstances which must be considered as modifying t=
his.  =3DBody=20

Condition.=3D=E2=80=94It need hardly be stated that the individual in perfe=
ct health can sustain complete=20

inanition longer than the enfeebled or diseased. The presence or absence of=
 _fat_ modifies=20

considerably the power of endurance.  =3DAge.=3D=E2=80=94Infants bear starv=
ation badly and succumb more=20

quickly than the adult. The aged, while they bear a moderate amount of food=
 better than the young=20



adult, do not endure a complete deprivation for so long a time.  =3DCold.=
=3D=E2=80=94The depressing=20

influence of cold upon the vital functions, especially in the young and fee=
ble, renders it a powerful=20

factor in shortening the duration of life in starvation.  =3DThe Supply of =
Water.=3D=E2=80=94When all food is=20

withheld, free use of water as a drink tends to increase the length of the =
interval before death. In=20

several cases of protracted fasting, the use of water in moderate amount ha=
s been resorted to with=20

the apparent result of amelioration of some of the distressing symptoms and=
 lengthening the=20

period of endurance.  Dr. Tanner, a physician, attempted in July and August=
, 1880, at New York, a=20

complete fast of forty days=E2=80=99 duration, with the exception of the fr=
ee use of water. In this case=20

absolute abstinence from all nourishment is questioned, as no strict medica=
l surveillance was=20

maintained.  The Italian Succi, at New York, in 1890, undertook a voluntary=
 abstinence from food=20

for forty days, under surveillance, with the use of simple liquids and of s=
ome narcotic substance.=20

He completed the fast, but beyond this fact the case is without scientific =
value.=20

=3DCatalepsy.=3D=E2=80=94Certain abnormal conditions of the nervous system =
are met where the activity of=20

the vital functions is very considerably lowered and the various processes =
of the economy are in a=20

condition of semi-suspension. Cases of this character have been observed wh=
ere the supply of=20

food has been almost entirely suspended for a period of several days, with =
but little emaciation=20

and other symptoms characteristic of inanition.   WAS STARVATION ACCOMPANIE=
D BY OTHER=20

ILL TREATMENT?  This question may arise where evidences of starvation are a=
pparent.  Such=20

cases are met among young children neglected or abused by parents or those =
in whose care they=20

may have been placed, or among the alienated or sick in the care of cruel o=
r unsympathetic=20

attendants.  Infants placed with =E2=80=9Cwet-nurses=E2=80=9D or found in t=
he so-called =E2=80=9Cbaby farms=E2=80=9D also furnish=20

cases which fall under this head.  A careful examination into the collatera=
l circumstances of the=20

case, together with the results of a careful post-mortem examination, usual=
ly render a positive=20

answer to this question possible.   POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION.  The dead body=
 exhibits=20

appearances quite characteristic.  =3DEmaciation=3D is very marked and some=
times reaches an=20

extraordinary degree, surpassing that of prolonged and wasting diseases.  I=
n extreme cases the=20

fat entirely disappears throughout the body; the omentum and mesentery are =
entirely devoid of it,=20

as well as the subcutaneous and intermuscular cellular tissue. The muscles =
are atrophied and the=20

_heart_ is sometimes considerably reduced in size; the liver and kidneys in=
 some cases show=20

great reduction of volume. The spleen also is small and often softened.  Th=
e =3Dstomach=3D and=20

=3Dintestines=3D usually display an extensive thinning of their walls, so m=
uch so that their contents=20

may be distinguished through them; their calibre also is frequently found t=
o be diminished, though=20

occasionally they may be distended with gas. Usually they are empty, or con=
tain only a small=20

quantity of bile and fecal matter. In some cases various foreign substances=
 which have been=20

swallowed by=20


_
any explanation to them, neither shalt thou reprove them; but     there sha=
ll be an account of all the=20

destruction done by them in     their respective seasons.(158)      ... He =
looked in silence, rejoicing=20

they were devoured, swallowed     up, and carried off, and leaving them in =
the power of every=20

beast     for food....(159)   Those who labour under the impression that th=
e Occultists of any nation=20

reject the _Bible_, in its original text and meaning, are wrong. As well re=
ject the _Books of Thoth_,=20

the Chaldaean _Kabalah_ or the _Book of Dzyan_ itself. Occultists only reje=
ct the one-sided=20

interpretations and the human element in the _Bible_, which is an Occult, a=
nd therefore a sacred,=20

volume as much as the others. And terrible indeed is the punishment of all =
those who transgress=20

the permitted limits of secret revelations. From Prometheus to Jesus, and f=
rom Him to the highest=20

Adept as to the lowest disciple, every revealer of mysteries has had to bec=
ome a Chrestos, a=20

"man of sorrow" and a martyr. "Beware," said one of the greatest Masters, "=
of revealing the=20

Mystery to those without"--to the profane, the Sadducee and the unbeliever.=
 All the great=20

Hierophants in history are shown ending their lives by violent deaths--Budd=
ha,(160) Pythagoras,=20

Zoroaster, most of the great Gnostics, the founders of their respective sch=
ools; and in our own=20

more modern epoch a number of Fire-Philosophers, of Rosicrucians and Adepts=
. All of these are=20

shown--whether plainly or under the veil of allegory--as paying the penalty=
 for the revelations they=20

had made. This may seem to the profane reader only coincidence. To the Occu=
ltist, the death of=20

every "Master" is significant, and appears pregnant with meaning. Where do =
we find in history that=20

"Messenger" grand or humble, an Initiate or a Neophyte, who, when he was ma=
de the bearer of=20

some hitherto concealed truth or truths, was not crucified and rent to shre=
ds by the "dogs" of envy,=20

malice and ignorance? Such is the terrible Occult law; and he who does not =
feel in himself the=20

heart of victims to appease hunger have been found in them.  The thinning o=
f the walls, so=20

constantly noted, has been considered as a specially characteristic symptom=
 of starvation.[965]=20

The congestion, softening, and ulcerations which have been observed in some=
 cases cannot be=20

considered as evidences of starvation or as its results, but rather as bein=
g due to an enteritis=20

induced by the ingestion of improper substances.  The =3Dgall bladder=3D is=
 usually found filled with=20

dark and inspissated bile. In death by starvation the entire organs of the =
body exhibit no specific=20

form of disease. Evidences of the existence of an organic affection observe=
d in the post-mortem=20

examination at once raise the question:   WAS DEATH CAUSED BY STARVATION OR=
=20

DISEASE?  Was the original disease aggravated by a failure to supply the pa=
tient with food, or are=20

the lesions observed the result of starvation? A positive conclusion can be=
 reached in such cases=20

by carefully considering the results of a post-mortem examination together =
with other facts elicited=20

by the inquiry.  Harriet Staunton,[966] a young girl, had been kept in clos=
e confinement by four=20

interested persons, and removed in great haste, when in a condition of extr=
eme prostration, to=20

Penge, where she died, on the day succeeding her removal, in a state of ext=
reme exhaustion and=20

emaciation. Fat was absent from every part of the body; the stomach and int=
estines were empty,=20

contracted, and their walls were greatly thinned.  A small deposit of tuber=
cle was found at the=20

summit of the left lung and a recent deposit of miliary tubercle beneath th=
e arachnoid, upon the=20

surface of one of the cerebral hemispheres. No other tuberculous deposits w=
ere found. The=20

opinion given by the physicians making the post-mortem examination was that=
 death resulted from=20

starvation. This opinion was shared by Professor Virchow, of Berlin, who st=
ated that the=20

tuberculous deposits found could not explain the cause of death.  In this c=
ase the extreme=20



emaciation, entire absence of fat, thinning of the intestinal walls,=20


_
and the soul of a dove to forgive the poor ignorant fools, let him give up =
the Sacred Science. To=20

succeed, the Occultist must be fearless; he has to brave dangers, dishonour=
 and death, to be=20

forgiving, and to be silent on that which cannot be given. Those who have v=
ainly laboured in that=20

direction must wait in these days--as the _Book of Enoch_ teaches--"until t=
he evil-doers be=20

consumed" and the power of the wicked annihilated. It is not lawful for the=
 Occultist to seek or=20

even to thirst for revenge: let him       Wait until sin pass away; for the=
ir [the sinners'] names shall=20

be     blotted out of the holy books [the astral records], their seed     s=
hall be destroyed and their=20

spirits slain.(161)   Esoterically, Enoch is the "Son of man," the first; a=
nd symbolically, the first=20

Sub-Race of the _Fifth_ Root Race.(162) And if his name yields for purposes=
 of numerical and=20

astronomical glyphs the meaning of the solar year, or 365, in conformity to=
 the age assigned to=20

him in _Genesis_, it is because, being the seventh, he is, for Occult purpo=
ses, the personified=20

period of the two preceding Races with their fourteen Sub-Races. Therefore,=
 he is shown in the=20

Book as the great grandfather of Noah who, in his turn, is the personificat=
ion of the mankind of the=20

Fifth, struggling with that of the Fourth Root-Race--the great period of th=
e revealed and profaned=20

Mysteries, when the "sons of God" coming down on Earth took for wives the d=
aughters of men,=20

and taught them the secrets of the Angels; in other words, when the "mind-b=
orn" men of the Third=20

Race mixed themselves with those of the Fourth, and the divine Science was =
gradually brought=20

down by men to Sorcery.      SECTION IX. HERMETIC AND KABALISTIC DOCTRINES.=
   The=20

cosmogony of Hermes is as veiled as the Mosaic system, only it is upon its =
face far more in=20

harmony with the doctrines of the Secret Sciences and even of Modern Scienc=
e. Says the thrice=20

great Trismegistus, "the hand that shaped the world out of formless pre-exi=
stent matter is no=20

hand"; to which _Genesis_ is made to reply, "The world was created out of n=
othing," although the=20

_Kabalah_ denies such a meaning in its opening sentences. The Kabalists hav=
e never, any more=20

than have the Indian Aryans, admitted such an absurdity. With them, Fire, o=
r Heat, and=20

Motion(163) were chiefly instrumental in the formation of the world out of =
preexisting Matter. The=20

Parabrahman and Mulaprakriti of the Vedantins are the prototypes of the En =
Suph and Shekinah=20

of the Kabalists. Aditi is the original of Sephira, and the Prajapatis are =
the elder brothers of the=20

Sephiroth. The nebular theory of Modern Science, with all its mysteries, is=
 solved in the=20

cosmogony of the Archaic Doctrine; and the paradoxical though very scientif=
ic enunciation, that=20

"cooling causes contraction and extreme emaciation alone is not sufficient =
to decide the case to=20

be one of starvation, its existence, taken in connection with some of the c=
onditions found=20

constantly in persons known to have died of starvation, is a strongly corro=
borative fact. Nor can its=20

absence be taken as conclusive evidence that death occurred from other caus=
e than starvation,=20

since in some cases of death from inanition emaciation has not been extreme=
 and in a few cases=20

not at all marked.[967] Instances of this character are reported by Taylor =
and others.   DISEASES=20

PRODUCED BY STARVATION.  The effect of insufficient alimentation in the pro=
duction of disease=20

has long been recognized. It is understood that this result follows the def=
iciency in either quality or=20

quantity. The so-called =E2=80=9Cfamine fever,=E2=80=9D prevalent in times =
of dearth, has afforded extensive=20

opportunity for observation of the effects produced. The symptoms developed=
 are those directly=20

referable to impoverishment of the blood. Pallor, emaciation, nervous depre=
ssion, derangement of=20

the digestive organs, and muscular enfeeblement appear in every case.  The =
development of=20

strumous, herpetic, and cutaneous diseases generally is marked.  Of the sec=
ondary effects, the=20



cachectic condition induced expresses itself in pulmonary phthisis largely,=
 while in infants and very=20

young children intestinal disorders are specially frequent. Organic disease=
s already existing are=20

seriously aggravated; wounds fail to heal, become ulcerative and sometimes =
gangrenous; while all=20

degenerative processes are rapidly hastened to a fatal issue.[968]         =
