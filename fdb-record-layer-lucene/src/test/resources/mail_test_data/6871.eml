By: Dr. Sam Vaknin  Also published by United Press International (UPI)  The=
 State of Israel was in=20

the grip of anti-Soviet jingoism in the early 1970's. "Let My People Go!" -=
 screamed umpteen=20

unfurled banners, stickers, and billboards. Russian dissidents were cast as=
 the latest link in a=20

chain of Jewish martyrdom. Russian immigrants were welcomed by sweating min=
isters on the=20



sizzling tarmac of the decrepit Lod Airport. Russia imposed exorbitant "dip=
loma taxes"=20

(reimbursement of educational subsidies) on emigrating Jews, thus exacerbat=
ing the outcry.  The=20

often disdainful newcomers were clearly much exercised by the minutia of th=
e generous economic=20

benefits showered on them by the grateful Jewish state. Yet, they were desc=
ribed by the Israeli=20

media as zealous Zionists, returning to their motherland to re-establish in=
 it a long-interrupted=20

Jewish presence. Thus, is a marvelous fiat of spin-doctoring, economic immi=
grants became=20

revenant sons.  Congress joined the chorus in 1974, with the Jackson-Vanik =
Amendment to the=20

Trade Reform Act - now Title IV of the Trade Act. It was Sponsored by Senat=
or Henry ("Scoop")=20

Jackson of Washington and Rep. Charles Vanik of Ohio, both Democrats.  It f=
orbids the=20

government to extend the much coveted "Most Favored Nation (MFN)" status - =
now known as=20

"Normal Trade Relations" - NTR - with its attendant trade privileges to "no=
n-market economy"=20

countries with a dismal record of human rights - chiefly the right to freel=
y and inexpensively=20

emigrate.  This prohibition also encompasses financial credits from the var=
ious organs of the=20

American government - the Export-Import Bank, the Commodity Credit Corporat=
ion (CCC), and=20

the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).  Though applicable to m=
any authoritarian=20

countries - such as Vietnam, the subject of much heated debate with every p=
residential waiver -=20

the thrust of the legislation is clearly anti-Russian. Henry Kissinger, the=
 American Secretary of=20

State at the time, was so alarmed, that he flew to Moscow and extracted fro=
m the Kremlin a=20

promise that "the rate of emigration from the USSR would begin to rise prom=
ptly from the 1973=20

level."  The demise of the USSR was hastened by this forced openness and th=
e increasing=20

dissidence it fostered. Jackson-Vanik was a formidable instrument in the co=
ld warrior's arsenal.=20

More than 1.5 million Jews left Russia since 1975. At the time, Israelis re=
garded the Kremlin as=20

their mortal enemy.  Thus, when the Amendment passed, official Israel was e=
xuberant. The late=20

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin wrote this to President Gerald Ford:  "The ann=
ouncement that=20

agreement has been obtained facilitating immigration of Soviet Jews to Isra=
el is causing great joy=20

to the people of Israel and to Jewish communities everywhere. This achievem=
ent in the field of=20

human rights would not have been possible but for your personal sympathy fo=
r the cause involved,=20

for your direct concern and deep interest."  And, to Senator Henry Jackson,=
 one of the two=20

sponsors of the bill:  "Dear Scoop,  The agreement which has been achieved =
concerning=20

immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel has been published in this country -a =
few hours ago and is=20

evoking waves of joy throughout Israel and no doubt throughout Jewish commu=
nities in every part=20

of the globe. This great achievement could not have been possible but for y=
our personal=20

leadership which rallied such wide support in both Houses of Congress, for =
the endurance with=20

which you pursued this struggle and for the broad human idealism which moti=
vated your activities=20

on behalf of this great humanitarian cause. At this time therefore I would =
like to send you my=20

heartfelt appreciation and gratitude."  US trade policy is often subordinat=
ed to its foreign policy. It=20

is frequently sacrificed to the satisfaction of domestic constituencies, pr=
essure groups, and interest=20

lobbies. It is used to reward foreign allies and punish enemies overseas.  =
The Jackson-Vanik=20

Amendment represents the quintessence of this relationship. President Clint=
on tacitly admitted as=20

much when he publicly decoupled trade policy from human rights in 1994.  Th=
e disintegration of=20

the Evil Empire - and the privatization of Russian foreign trade - has rend=
ered the law a relic of the=20

Cold War. Russian Jews - including erstwhile "refuseniks", such as Natan (A=
natoly) Sharansky -=20



now openly demand to rescind it and to allow Russia to "graduate" into a Pe=
rmanent Normal=20

Trade Relations (PNTR) status by act of Congress.  American Jews - though s=
ympathetic - would=20

like guarantees from Russia, in view of a rising wave of anti-Semitism, tha=
t Jews in its territory will=20

go unharmed. They also demand the right of unhindered and unsupervised self=
-organization for=20

Jewish communities and a return of Jewish communal property confiscated by =
the Soviet regime.=20

Congress is even more suspicious of Russian intentions. Senator Gordon Smit=
h, a Republican=20

from Oregon, recently proposed an amendment that would deprive Russia of fo=
reign aid if it=20

passes legislation impinging on religious freedom. Together with Hillary Cl=
inton, a Democrat from=20

New York, he introduced a damning Jackson-Vanik resolution, saying:  "Any a=
ctions by the United=20

States Government to "graduate" or terminate the application of the Jackson=
-Vanik Amendment to=20

any individual country must take into account ... appropriate assurances re=
garding the continued=20

commitment of that government to enforcing and upholding the fundamental hu=
man rights=20

envisioned in the Amendment. The United States Government must demonstrate =
how, in=20

graduating individual countries, the continued dedication of the United Sta=
tes to these fundamental=20

rights will be assured."  The Senate still refuses to repeal the Jackson-Va=
nik Amendment despite=20

its impact on six former Soviet republics and other countries and despite p=
assionate pleas from=20

the administration. On May 22 it passed a non-binding resolution calling fo=
r PNTR with Russia.=20

Jackson-Vanik remained in place because of the row with Russia over imports=
 of US poultry.=20

Senator Joseph Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, w=
ho represents a=20

major poultry producing state (Delaware) made these statesmanlike comments =
following the=20

session:  "I can either be Russia's best friend or worst enemy. They keep f=
ooling around like this,=20

they're going to have me as their enemy."  Mikhail Margelov, Chairman of th=
e Foreign Relations=20

Committee of the Federation Council, understandably retorted, according to =
Radio Free=20

Europe/Radio Liberty quoting from strana.ru:  "By citing the controversy ov=
er chicken legs, the=20

Democrats have openly acknowledged that Jackson-Vanik does not protect Russ=
ian Jews, but=20

American farmers."  According to ITAR-TASS, he presented to President Putin=
 a report which=20

blamed Russia's "unstable" trade relations with the USA on the latter's "di=
scriminatory legislative=20

norms."  The Amendment has been a dead letter since 1994, due to a well-ent=
renched ritual of=20

annual Presidential waiver which precedes the granting of NTR status to Rus=
sia. The waiver is=20

based on humiliating semi-annual reviews. The sole remaining function of Ja=
ckson-Vanik seems,=20

therefore, to be derogatory.  This infuriates Russians of all stripes - pro=
-Western reformers=20

included. "This demonstrates the double standards of the U.S." - Anatoly B.=
 Chubais, the=20

Chairman of UES, Russia's electricity monopoly, told BusinessWeek. "It unde=
rmines trust." Putin=20

called the law "notorious".  In October last year, the Russian Foreign Mini=
stry released this=20

unusually strongly-worded statement:  "The Jackson-Vanik Amendment has bloc=
ked the granting=20

to Russia of most favored nation status in trade with the USA on a permanen=
t and unconditional=20

basis over many years, inflicting harm upon the spirit of constructive and =
equal cooperation=20

between our countries. It is rightly considered one of the last anachronism=
s of the era of=20

confrontation and distrust."  Considering that China - with its awful recor=
d of egregious human=20

rights violations - was granted PNTR last year, Russia rightly feels slight=
ed. Its non-recognition as=20

a "market economy" under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment led to the imposition =

$4.8 billion of IMF funds are alleged to have gone amiss during the implosi=

 in the bank accounts=20

of obscure corporations - and, then, incredibly, vanished into thin air.  T=

funds in 1998 was none other than Mikhail Kasyanov, Russia's current Prime =

appointed an investigative committee in 1999. Its report remains classified=

that IMF funds were embezzled in the wake of the 1998 forced devaluation of=
