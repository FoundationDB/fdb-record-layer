out a tunnel with my hunting-knife, and completed a capacious arbour, thoro=
ughly protected from=20

the sun. In this it was far more agreeable to pass the day than at the camp=
; accordingly we=20

arranged the ground with mats and carpets, and my wife converted the thorny=
 bower into an=20

African drawing-room, where she could sit with her work and enjoy the view =
of the river at her feet,=20

and moreover watch the fishing."   CHAPTER X.  A FEW NOTES AT EHETILLA.  I =
WILL not=20

follow the dates of the journal consecutively, but merely pounce from time =
to time upon such=20

passages as will complete the description of our life at Ehetilla.  "Octobe=
r 4.--I went out fishing in=20

the usual place, where the Till joins the Atbara; the little stream has dis=
appeared, and the bed is=20

now perfectly dry, but there are many large rocks and sandbanks in the rive=
r, which are excellent=20

places for heavy fish. I had only three runs, but I landed them all. The fi=
rst was a beautiful baggar=20

about forty pounds, from which time a long interval elapsed before I had an=
other. I placed a bait of=20

about a pound upon my treble hook, and this being a fine lively fellow, was=
 likely to entice a=20

monster. I was kept waiting for a considerable time, but at last he came wi=
th the usual tremendous=20

rush. I gave him about fifty yards of line before I fixed him, and the stru=
ggle then commenced, as=20

usual with the baggar, by his springing out of the water, and showing his s=
uperb form and size.=20

This was a magnificent fish, and his strength was so great, that in his vio=
lent rushes he would take=20

sixty or seventy yards of line without my permission. I could not check him=
, as the line burnt and=20

cut my fingers to such a degree that I was forced to let it go, and my only=
 way of working him was=20

to project the butt of the rod in the usual manner; this was a very feeble =
break upon the rush of=20

such a fish. At last, after about half an hour of alternate bullying and co=
axing, I got him into the=20

shallows, and Bacheet attempted to manage him; this time he required the as=
sistance of Wat=20

Gamma, who quickly ran down from the camp, and after much struggling, an en=
ormous baggar of=20

between seventy and eighty pounds was hauled to the water, and half a teasp=
oonful of salt; cover,=20

and simmer until the moisture is reduced one-half, and add two tablespoonfu=
ls of Maggi Bouillon,=20

a pint of hot water and a gill of good sherry; cover and simmer on back of =
range until the meat is=20

very tender. Put it away to get cold and next day warm it up in a frying pa=
n or chafing dish, add a=20

little lemon or lime juice and serve.     Plain Mutton Curry.   Cut up half=
 a pound of cold boiled=20

mutton in symmetrical pieces. Chop up an onion and fry it with three tables=
poonfuls of Antonini=20

Olive Oil or butter, add the meat, toss it about a few moments, strew over =
it a teaspoonful of J. P.=20

Smith's Curry Powder, and add half a pint of gravy; simmer gently a few min=
utes and serve. This=20

is about as simple a mode of preparing the dish as can be proposed; it may =
be improved by frying=20

a little apple with the onion and adding more water, then thickening it wit=
h browned flour.  Raw=20

mutton should be fried a little before it is added to the Curry sauce. Mutt=
on chops may be curried=20

the same as veal chops.     Curry of Lamb.   The breast of lamb freed from =
fat makes a very good=20

Curry. Cut up a pound of it and toss the pieces about in the frying pan a f=
ew moments. Sprinkle=20

over the meat a teaspoonful of the J. P. Smith Curry Powder and a gill of v=
inegar; cover, cook ten=20

minutes and put the meat away to allow the Curry to permeate it. When wante=
d fry an onion=20

brown, add to it half a pint of hot water, a tablespoonful of Maggi Bouillo=
n and a little salt; simmer=20

ten minutes, strain and add the meat with a square of sugar, two tablespoon=
fuls of Chutney or=20

Chili relish, or tomato catsup. If convenient add the grated fruit of half =
a fresh cocoanut. Simmer=20

slowly an hour, serve with boiled rice and orange juice in a sauce-boat.   =
  Curried Pork=20

Tenderloin.   Pound together in a mortar a clove of garlic, a tablespoonful=
 of J. P. Smith's Curry=20



Powder, a square of sugar, the juice of a lemon, and a saltspoonful of salt=
; add a tablespoonful of=20

Epicurean Sauce, and one of French mustard. Select a fresh pork tenderloin,=
 cut it into three-inch=20

pieces and cut gashes lengthwise all over the meat; into these gashes rub t=
he paste. Put=20

"I never enjoyed the landing of a fish more than on the present occasion, a=
nd I immediately had=20

the flag hoisted for a signal, and sent the largest that I had just caught =
as a present to Florian and=20

his people. The two fish as they lay upon the green reeds, glittering in si=
lvery scales, were a sight=20

to gladden the eyes of a fisherman, as their joint weight was above one hun=
dred and twenty=20

pounds. I caught another fish in the evening something over twenty pounds, =
an ugly and useful=20

creature, the coor, that I despised, although it is a determined enemy whil=
e in play.  "October 10.--

Set fire to the low spear grass of the valley. The river is now very low, e=
xposing in many places=20

large beds of shingle, and rocks hitherto concealed. The water level is now=
 about thirty feet below=20

the dried sedges and trash left over each, and bake in the oven twenty minu=
tes. Turn frequently=20

while they are cooking. These are excellent cold.     Curried Eggs.   Hard =
boil six eggs; when cool=20

enough, remove the shell and quarter them lengthwise. Put these on a hot pl=
atter, surround the=20

pile with a good Curry sauce, garnish the border with boiled rice and serve=
.     Curried Hamburg=20

Steak.   Ask the dealer for a pound of chopped lean meat; shape it into lit=
tle cakes, over each cake=20

rub a little Curry oil and a few drops of garlic oil, and fry or bake the s=
teaks. Put them in the centre=20

of a dish and pour over them a good strong Curry sauce and serve plain.    =
 Curried Canned Beef.=20

Make the Curry sauce in the usual manner, warm the slices of the canned cor=
ned beef in it and=20

serve.     Curried Plantain.   Select the long green plantains=20


_
high floods upon the overhanging boughs. The bed of the Atbara, and that of=
 the Settite, are=20

composed of rounded pebbles of all sizes, and masses of iron ore. Large oys=
ters (Etheria),=20

resembling the pearl oysters of Ceylon, are very numerous, and, from them a=
nd boil them forty=20

minutes. Put them on a hot platter, cover them with Curry sauce, squeeze th=
e juice of an orange=20

over them and serve.     Vegetable Curries.   Cold boiled vegetables as wel=
l as the fresh=20

vegetables are all excellent served as=20
