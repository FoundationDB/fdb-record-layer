weight of good and of ill that each man hath done, and who suffereth not th=

knowledge, save what He willeth. His Throne    comprehendeth the Heavens an=
d the Earth, and=20

the care of them    burdeneth Him not. And He is the High, the Great.'--_Ku=
r-an_,    ii. 256.  But=20

with this Power there is also the gentleness that belongs only to great str=
ength. God is the=20

Guardian over His servants, the Shelterer of the orphan, the Guider of the =
erring, the Deliverer=20

from every affliction; in His hand is Good, and He is the Generous Lord, th=
e Gracious, the Hearer,=20

the Near-at-Hand. Every soorah of the Kur-an begins with the words, 'In the=
 Name of God, the=20

Compassionate, the Merciful,' and Mohammad was never tired of telling the p=
eople how God was=20

Very-Forgiving, that His love for man was more tender than the mother-bird =
for her young.  It is too=20

often forgotten how much there is in the Kur-an of the loving-kindness of G=
od, but it must be=20

allowed that these are not the main thoughts in Mohammad's teaching. It is =
the doctrine of the=20

Might of God that most held his imagination, and that has impressed itself =
most strongly upon=20

Muslims of all ages. The fear rather than the love of God is the spur of Is=
lam. There can be no=20

question which is the higher incentive to good; but it is nearly certain th=
at the love of God is an=20

idea absolutely foreign to most of the races that have accepted Islam, and =
to preach such a=20

doctrine would have been to mistake the leaning of the Semitic mind.  The l=
eading doctrine of=20

Mohammad, then, is the belief in One All-Powerful God. Islam is the self-su=
rrender of every man=20

to the will of God. Its danger lies in the stress laid on the power of God,=
 which has brought about=20

the stifling effects of fatalism. Mohammad taught the foreknowledge of God,=
 but he did not lay=20

down precisely the doctrine of Predestination. He found it, as all have fou=
nd it, a stumbling-block in=20

the way of man's progress. It perplexed him, and he spoke of it, but often =
contradicted himself;=20

and he would become angry if the subject were mooted in his presence: 'Sit =
not with a disputer=20

about fate,' he said, 'nor begin a conversation with him.' Mohammad vaguely=
 recognised that little=20

margin of Free Will which makes life not wholly mechanical.  This doctrine =
of one Supreme God, to=20

whose will it is the duty of every man to surrender himself, is the kernel =
of Islam, the truth for which=20

Mohammad lived and suffered and triumphed. But it was no new teaching, as h=
e himself was=20

constantly saying. His was only the last of revelations. Many prophets--Abr=
aham, Moses, and=20

Christ--had taught the same faith before; but people had hearkened little t=
o their words. So=20

Mohammad was sent, not different from them, only a messenger, yet the last =
and greatest of=20

them, the 'seal of prophecy,' the 'most excellent of the creation of God.' =
This is the second dogma=20

of Islam: Mohammad is the apostle of God. It is well worthy of notice that =
it is not said,=20

'Mohammad is the only apostle of God.' Islam is more tolerant in this matte=
r than other religions.=20

Its prophet is not the sole commissioner of the Most High, nor is his teach=
ing the only true=20

teaching the world has ever received. Many other messengers had been sent b=
y God to guide=20

men to the right, and these taught the same religion that was in the mouth =
of the preacher of=20

Islam. Hence Muslims reverence Moses him. He was growing weary and exhauste=
d. But the dogs=20

were still coming!  When he began to fear he could not escape, it began to =
rain, falling gently at=20



first, and then more heavily.  In the next story you will read of how the r=
ain helped him.=20

STORY XI                    WHITE TAIL=E2=80=99S ADVENTURE IN THE CAMP   Th=
e rain made White Tail=E2=80=99s=20

difficulties worse, for the logs and stones were so slippery that he stumbl=
ed time and again, and to=20

avoid a fall he had to slacken his pace. The dogs on the other hand, kept u=
p their pace, as the=20

slippery things did not seem to bother them, and they began to gain on the =
fleeing buck very=20

rapidly. Their deep baying drew so near that White Tail became startled.  B=
ut all this time the rain=20

was planning to help the buck, although he did not know it at the time. He =
was feeling very=20

uncomfortable, as well as frightened. The steady downpour soaked him to the=
 skin, and the driving=20

wind splashed the rain-drops in his eyes, half blinding him.  When the dogs=
 drew so near that=20

White Tail felt they would soon see him, he turned abruptly around, and ran=
 at right angles to his=20

former course. He had not tried dodging before, but had kept on a straight =
course.  To his surprise=20

he heard the barking of the dogs grow suddenly fainter, and then very confu=
sed. The fact was the=20

heavy downpour of rain had nearly blotted out his trail, and the dogs could=
 not readily pick it up=20

again. So long as he kept on in straight course, the dogs had followed him.=
  But now, by dodging,=20

White Tail found he could easily elude them, so faint was the scent he left=
 behind. The rain=20

washed that away, and completely baffled the dogs.  It was a great blessing=
, for White Tail was=20

badly winded. He was so tired that as soon as he left the dogs far in the r=
ear he sought shelter=20

from the rain. He was almost exhausted with his efforts, and a bed of leave=
s or grass would be the=20

greatest blessing in the world.  Directly ahead of him, he saw an old deser=
ted open camp standing=20

in a partial clearing. It was built of pine logs, with the bark left on, an=
d a roof and three sides. The=20

front was left open, with an old camp-fire place of stones and rocks a few =
feet away.  At first White=20

Tail stopped and looked at the camp suspiciously. If the man hunters lived =
in it, he should avoid it=20

as he would Puma or Timber, but if it were deserted there would be no harm =
in seeking shelter=20

under its roof. He watched, listened and sniffed for a long time before he =
dared approach it.  Then=20

by degrees he walked closer until he had a chance to look inside. There was=
 no one there, and it=20

had not been inhabited for a long, long time. White Tail could tell this by=
 the absence of any odor.=20

=E2=80=9CI think it=E2=80=99s safe,=E2=80=9D he muttered after another clos=
e examination. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll spend the night here. I=E2=80=99m=20

dreadfully tired, and so wet I=E2=80=99m cold and shivery.=E2=80=9D  He wal=
ked under the sheltering roof, and found=20

a bed of sweet-smelling spruce boughs in one corner. They were perfectly dr=
y, and White Tail=20

gave a grunt of satisfaction. It was a dry shelter, with a soft, dry bed al=
ready prepared for him. He=20

dropped down on it with a sigh of intense relief.  It rained hard all night=
. White Tail could hear the=20

floods of water pouring on the roof of his shelter, but under it the place =
was dry and warm.=20

Darkness came early in the woods, and it was soon pitchy black.  He felt pe=
rfectly safe if none of=20

the night prowlers appeared. The rain, however, was a protection to him, fo=
r even Puma and=20

Timber rarely ventured forth in such a storm. They preferred to do their hu=
nting on clear, dry nights=20

when the scent of their prey was clear and distinct.  =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=
=99t think anybody will disturb me until=20

morning,=E2=80=9D White Tail said, =E2=80=9Cand I can rest here in peace.=
=E2=80=9D  But of course you can never tell what=20

may happen in the wildwoods. Suppose Puma or Timber Wolf should be caught a=
way=20


_
their founder is that he was the last and best of the messengers of the one=
 God.[18]  After the=20

belief in God and his prophets and scriptures, the Muslim must believe in a=
ngels, good and evil=20

genii, in the resurrection and the judgment, and in future rewards and puni=
shments. What the=20

teaching of the Kur-an is upon these points may be seen in the First Part o=
f the 'Selections.' They=20

form a very common weapon of attack on the ground of their superstition, th=
eir anthropomorphism,=20

and their sensuality. Yet these minor beliefs have their place in all relig=
ions, and they are=20

conceived in scarcely more absurdly realistic a manner in Islam than in any=
 other creed. Every=20

religion seems to need an improbable, almost a ludicrous, side, in order to=
 provide material for the=20

faith of the masses. Mohammad himself was what is called a superstitious ma=
n, and the=20

improbable side thus found its way easily into his creed. With all the fanc=
ies floating in Arabia in=20

his time, it would have been strange if he had introduced nothing of the su=
perstitious into Islam.=20

The Jinn, the If they were, and saw the open camp, they would very naturall=
y seek it for shelter=20

just as White Tail had done.  It was quite early in the evening when White =
Tail was awakened from=20

slumber by a thump, thump outside. It came nearer and nearer. White Tail wa=
s so frightened that=20

he could scarcely breathe. He trembled in every limb. Some animal was comin=
g around the side of=20

the open camp.  Before White Tail could leap to his feet to run, a head was=
 thrust around the=20

corner, and a pair of wonderful eyes looked at him. At the same instant the=
 owner of them caught=20

sight of White Tail=E2=80=99s.  =E2=80=9CHello, Bumper!=E2=80=9D White Tail=
 exclaimed, when he recognized Bumper the=20

White Rabbit. =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t be afraid. I=E2=80=99m White Tail the =
Deer.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, I=E2=80=99m mighty glad of that,=E2=80=9D re=
plied=20

Bumper, approaching. =E2=80=9CYou gave me an awful start at first. I though=
t you were Mr. Fox or Sneaky=20

the Wolf or Puma.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd I thought you were Timber Wolf or =
the man hunters or their dogs.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CSeeing that we were both wrong then,=E2=80=9D said Bumper, =E2=80=
=9Cwe might share this camp between us. You=20

_
of the air and water, have not done much harm to the Mohammadan mind; and t=
hey have given so=20

many a delightful fable to the West, that we must feel a certain grateful r=
espect for them. The=20

realistic pictures of paradise and hell have exercised a more serious influ=
ence. The minute details=20

of these infernal and celestial pictures must move alternately the disgust =
and the contemptuous=20

amusement of a Western reader; yet these same things were very real facts t=
o Mohammad, and=20

have been of the utmost importance to generation after generation of Muslim=
s. In the present day=20

there are cultured men who receive these descriptions in the same allegoric=
al sense as some=20

Christians accept the Revelation of S. John--which, indeed, in some respect=
s offers a close=20

parallel to the pictorial parts of the Kur-an; but the vast majority of bel=
ievers (like many Christians=20

in the parallel case) take the descriptions literally, and there can be no =
doubt that the belief=20

founded on such pictures, accepted literally, must work an ill effect on th=
e professors of the faith of=20

which these doctrines form a minor, but a too prominent, part; and it is th=
e aim of rational Muslims=20

to sweep away such cobwebs from their sky.  Islam lies more in doing than i=
n believing. That 'faith=20

without works is dead' is a doctrine which every day's routine must bring h=
ome to the mind of the=20

devout Muslim. The practical  Then he told the White Rabbit about his adven=
tures, ending up with=20

the pursuit by the dogs, and his escape to the deserted camp.  =E2=80=9CYou=
 certainly did have a hard time=20

of it,=E2=80=9D said Bumper when he had finished. =E2=80=9CAnd you=E2=80=99=
re a long way from home. I do hope you can=20

get back without accident. What=E2=80=99s that?=E2=80=9D  Bumper stopped, a=
nd White Tail raised his head in=20

alarm. There was a scream outside, and then a wild commotion in the bushes.=
 The next moment=20

something came rushing in the camp, and flopped down right at White Tail=E2=
=80=99s feet.  It was Rusty the=20

Blackbird. =E2=80=9CHelp! Help! Oh, help me!=E2=80=9D Rusty cried. =E2=80=
=9CGreat Horn the Owl is after me! Here he comes=20

now!=E2=80=9D  And out of the darkness swept a shadowy figure that hardly m=
ade any noise; but the=20

moment it saw White Tail it stopped and circled around his head. White Tail=
 raised his head, and=20

swung his big antlers threateningly at Great Horn.  =E2=80=9CLook out,=E2=
=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cor I=E2=80=99ll hit you! Don=E2=80=99t come=20

any nearer, Great Horn!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIs that you, White Tail?=E2=80=
=9D asked Great Horn. =E2=80=9CI didn=E2=80=99t know you were=20

here. Well, I won=E2=80=99t disturb you. I=E2=80=99m after Rusty there at y=
our feet. Let me have him, and I will leave=20

at once.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou will leave at once without Rusty,=E2=80=9D =
replied White Tail. =E2=80=9CHe=E2=80=99s a friend of mine, and I=E2=80=99m=

going to protect him.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHoot! Hoot!=E2=80=9D shouted the O=
wl in laughter. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll take him whether you want=20

_
religion, beyond the actual profession of faith, are the performance of pra=
yer, the giving of alms,=20

the keeping of the fasts, and the accomplishing the pilgrimage. Mr. Lane ha=
s so minutely=20

described the regular prayers used over all the Mohammadan East, that it is=
 only necessary here=20

to refer to his account of them in the 'Modern Egyptians.' There it will be=
 seen that they form no=20

light part of the religious duties of the Muslim, especially since they inv=
olve careful preparatory=20

ablutions; for Mohammad impressed upon his followers the salutary doctrine =
that cleanliness is=20

around and knocked him over. One prong hurt Great Horn so that he flew back=
 to a safe place.  =E2=80=9CIf=20

you come nearer, I=E2=80=99ll hurt you worse the next time,=E2=80=9D warned=
 White Tail.  Great Horn sat there and=20

considered for some time, his great eyes blinking and winking. =E2=80=9CWha=
t are you doing here, White=20

Tail?=E2=80=9D he asked finally. =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t you know you=E2=80=

know it you ought to. I think Puma might be interested in knowing it. Now g=
