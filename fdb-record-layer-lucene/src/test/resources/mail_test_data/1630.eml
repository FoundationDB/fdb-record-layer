he left to enter doubt that she was a seat of industry and commerce, and th=
at the theory which=20

represents her industry and commerce as having been developed subsequently =
to her conquests=20

is the reverse of the fact. Whence, but from industry and commerce, could t=
he population and the=20

wealth have come? Peasant farmers do not live in cities, and plunderers do =
not accumulate. Rome=20

had around her what was then a rich and peopled plain; she stood at a meeti=
ng-place of=20

nationalities; she was on a navigable river, yet out of the reach of pirate=
s; the sea near her was full=20

of commerce, Etruscan, Greek, and Carthaginian. Her first colony was Ostia,=
 evidently commercial=20

and connected with salt-works, which may well have supplied the staple of h=
er trade. Her=20

patricians were financiers and money-lenders. We are=20

possession of a store near his plantation. This store was in Greensboro. Ei=
ther because the=20

business paid or because of another of his economic 'bad spells', ownership=
 of his plantation=20

passed to a man named Kimball and most of the slaves, with the exception of=
 Bill Austin and one=20

or two women--either transferred with the plantation or sold. Bill was kept=
 to do errands and=20

general work around the store.  Bill learned much about the operation of th=
e store, with the result=20

that when Mr. Smith left with the Southern Army he left his wife and Bill t=
o continue its operation.=20

By this time there used to be frequent stories whispered among the slaves i=
n the neighborhood--

and who came with their masters into the country store--of how this or that=
 slave ran away, and=20

with the white man-power of the section engaged in war, remained at large f=
or long periods or=20

escaped altogether.  These stories always interested Austin, with the resul=
t that one morning he=20

was absent when Mrs. Smith opened the store. He remained away 'eight or nin=
e days, I guess',=20

before a friend of the Smiths found him near Macon and threatened that he w=
ould 'half kill him' if=20

he didn't return immediately.  Either the threat--or the fact that in Macon=
 there were no part of the=20

story, and that the indebtedness has been represented as incurred not by lo=
ans of money, but by=20

advances of farm stock. This, however, completely contradicts the whole ten=
or of the narrative,=20

and especially what is said about the measures for relieving the debtor by =
reducing the rate of=20

interest and by deducting from the principal debt the interest already paid=
. The narrative as it=20

stands, moreover, is supported by analogy. It has a parallel in the economi=
cal history of ancient=20

Athens, and in the "scaling of debts," to use the American equivalent for _=
Seisachtheia_, by the=20

legislation of Solon. What prevents our supposing that usury, when it first=
 made its appearance on=20

the scene, before people had learned to draw the distinction between crimes=
 and defaults,=20

presented itself in a very coarse and cruel form? True, the currency was cl=
umsy, and retained=20

philological traces of a system of barter; but without commerce there could=
 have been no currency=20

at all.  Even more decisive is the proof afforded by the early political hi=
story of Rome. In that=20

wonderful first decade of Livy there is no doubt enough of Livy himself to =
give him a high place=20

among the masters of fiction. It is the epic of a nation of politicians,=20


_
available foodstuffs to be eaten all day as in the store--caused Austin to =
return. He was roundly=20

berated by his mistress, but finally forgiven by the worried woman who need=
ed his help around the=20

store more than she needed the contrite promises and effusive declarations =
that he would 'behave=20

alright for the rest of his life.'  And he did behave; for several whole mo=
nths. But by this tine he=20

was 'a great big boy', and he had caught sight of a young woman who took hi=
s fancy on his trip to=20

Macon. She was free herself; her father had bought her freedom with that of=
 her mother a few=20

years before, and did odd jobs for the white people in the city for a livel=
ihood. Bill had thoughts of=20

going back to Macon, marrying her, and bringing her back 'to work for Missu=
s with me.' He asked=20

permission to go, and was refused on the grounds that his help was too badl=
y needed at the store.=20

Shortly afterward he had again disappeared.  'Missus', however, knew too mu=
ch of his plans by=20

this time, and it was no difficult task to have him apprehended in Macon. p=
urposes of education as=20

the grand picture of Roman character and the richest treasury of Roman sent=
iment. But we can=20

hardly doubt that in the political portion there is a foundation of fact; i=
t is too circumstantial, too=20

consistent in itself, and at the same time too much borne out by analogy, t=
o be altogether fiction.=20

The institutions which we find existing in historic times must have been ev=
olved by some such=20

struggle between the orders of patricians and plebeians as that which Livy =
presents to us. And=20

these politics, with their parties and sections of parties, their shades of=
 political character, the=20

sustained interest which they imply in political objects, their various dev=
ices and compromises, are=20

not the politics of a community of peasant farmers, living apart each on hi=
s own farm and thinking=20

of his own crops: they are the politics of the quick-witted and gregarious =
population of an industrial=20

and commercial city. They are politics of the same sort as those upon which=
 the Palazzo Vecchio=20

looked down in Florence. That ancient=20


_
had such great objections to the apprehension, either, he says, because by =
this time he had=20

learned that the young woman in Macon had no slightest intention to give up=
 her freedom to join=20

him at Greensboro.  A relative of Mrs. Smith gave Austin a sound beating on=
 his return; for a time=20

it had the desired effect, and he stayed at the store and gave no further t=
rouble. Mrs. Smith,=20

however, thought of a surer plan of keeping him in Greensboro; she called h=
im and told him he=20

might have his freedom. Bill never attempted to again leave the place--alth=
ough he did not receive=20

a cent for his work--until his master had died, the store passed into the h=
ands of one of Mr. Smith's=20

sons, and the emancipation of all the slaves was a matter of eight or ten y=
ears' history!  When he=20

finally left Greene and Hancock Counties--about fifty-five years ago, Austi=
n settled in Jackson=20

County. He married and began the raising of a family. At present he has nin=
eteen living children,=20

more grandchildren than he can accurately tell, and is living with his thir=
d wife, a woman in her=20

republicanism may be described broadly with reference to its origin, as the=
 government of the city=20

and of the artisan, while monarchy and aristocracy are the governments of t=

farmers.  The legend which ascribes the assembly of centuries to the legisl=
ation of Servius=20

probably belongs to the same class as the legend which ascribes trial by ju=
ry and the division of=20

England into shires to the legislation of Alfred. Still the assembly of cen=
turies existed; it was=20

evidently ancient, belonging apparently to a stratum of institutions anteri=
or to the assembly of=20

tribes; and it was a constitution distributing political power and duties a=
ccording to a property=20

qualification which, in the upper grades, must, for the period, have been h=
igh, though measured by=20

a primitive currency. The existence of such qualifications, and the social =
ascendency of wealth=20

which the constitution implies, are inconsistent with the theory of a merel=
