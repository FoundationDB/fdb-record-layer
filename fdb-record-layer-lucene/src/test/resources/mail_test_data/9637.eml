philodendron monstera  "That isn't as well as I used to do," said Paul to h=
imself, "but perhaps I can make something more by and by. I will go now and=
 see what I can get for the ring."  As he had determined, he proceeded to a=
 pawnbroker's to sell, for all assured us that every day we went further in=
to the interior, they would lose flesh, that we should have them bitten by =
snakes in the forests, and arrive at Rio, if we ever got there, either on f=
oot, or philodendron monstera  "That isn't as well as I used to do," said P=
aul to himself, "but perhaps I can make something more by and by. I will go=
 now and see what I can get for the ring."  As he had determined, he procee=

her on foot, or _
like to pick up a pocketbook in the street, containing, say, twenty or twen=
ty-five dollars."  "That=20

would be very convenient," said his mother; "but I think it will hardly do =
to depend on such good=20

luck happening to you. By the way," she said, suddenly, "perhaps I can help=
 you, after all. Don't=20

you remember that gold ring I picked up in Central Park two years ago?"  "T=
he one you=20

advertised?"  "Yes. I advertised, or, rather, your father did; but we never=
 found an owner for it."  "I=20

remember it now, mother. Have you got the ring still?"  "I will get it."  M=
rs. Hoffman went to her=20

trunk, and, opening it, produced the ring referred to. It was a gold ring w=
ith a single stone of=20

considerable size.  "I don't know how much it is worth," said Mrs. Hoffman;=
 "but if the ring is a=20

diamond, as I think it is, it must be worth as much as twenty dollars."  "D=
id you ever price it?"  "No,=20

Paul; I have kept it, thinking that it would be something to fall back upon=
 if we should ever be hard=20

pressed. As long as we were able to get along without suffering, I thought =
I would keep it. Besides,=20

I had another feeling. It might belong to some person who prized it very mu=
ch, and the time might=20

come when we could find the owner. However, that is not likely after so lon=
g a time. So, if you=20

cannot raise the money in any other way, you may sell the ring."  "I might =
pawn it for thirty days,=20

mother. By that time I should be able to redeem it with the profits of my b=
usiness."  "I don't think=20

you could get enough from a pawn-broker."  "I can try, at any rate; but fir=
st I will see George Barry,=20

and find out whether he will take twenty dollars down, and the rest at the =
end of a month."  Paul=20

wrapped up the ring in a piece of paper, and deposited it in his vest pocke=
t. He waited till after=20

dinner, and then went at once to the necktie stand, where he made the propo=
sal to George Barry.=20

The young man shook his head.  "I'd like to oblige you, Paul," he said, "bu=
t I must have the money.=20

I have an offer of thirty-two dollars, cash, from another party, and I must=
 take up with it if I can't do=20

any better. I'd rather sell out to you, but you know I have to consult my o=
wn interest."  "Of course,=20

George, I can't complain of that."  "I think you will be able to borrow the=
 money somewhere."=20

"Most of my friends are as poor as myself," said Paul. "Still, I think I sh=
all be able to raise the=20

money. Only wait for me two days."  "Yes, Paul, ourselves in a thick forest=
 of some kind of pine,=20

we reached his house, but the _soi-disant_ Briton was from Amsterdam, could=
 speak no English,=20

was a little drunk, but asked us to get off and dine with him.  During the =
dinner, which we had all=20

alone, his wife and daughter standing looking at us (he too drunk to eat), =
pigs ran into the room, a=20

half-grown tapir lay in a corner, and two new-caught macaws screamed horrib=
ly, so that, the=20

banquet over, we did not stay, but thanked him in Portuguese, which he spok=
e badly, and rode off=20

home, determining to sleep at the first wood, rather than face a night in s=
uch a place.  The evening=20

caught us near to a forest, the trail, sandy and white, running close to a =
sort of cove formed in the=20

trees, and here we camped, taking our saddles off, lighting a fire, and lyi=
ng down to sleep just in=20

the opening of the cove, our horses tied inside.  All through the night peo=
ple appeared to pass=20

along the road.  I lay awake half-dozing now and then, and watched the bats=
, looked at the fire-

flies flitting about the trees, heard the harsh howling of the monkeys, the=
 tapirs stamp, the splash=20

made by the lobos and carpinchos as they dashed into the stream, and then s=
lept soundly, and=20

awoke to find one of the horses gone.  The moon shone brightly, and, waking=
 up my friend, I told=20

him of our loss. We knew the horse must have a rope attached to him, and th=
at he probably would=20

try to get back to Cruz Alta, along the road we came.  My horse was difficu=
lt to bit, but by the aid of=20

tying up one foot, and covering his eyes up with a handkerchief, we bitted =
him, then mounted both=20

of us upon his back, hiding the other saddle behind some grass, and started=
 on the road.  The=20



sandy trail was full of horses=E2=80=99 tracks, so that we could do nothing=
 but ride on, hoping to catch him=20

feeding by the way.  About a league we rode, and then, not seeing him, turn=
ed slowly back to get=20

the other saddle, make some coffee, and start home when it was light.  To o=
ur astonishment, upon=20

arriving at the cove, the other horse was there, and neighing wildly, strai=
ning on his rope, and it=20

appeared that he had never gone, but being tied close to the wood had wande=
red in, and we,=20

thinking he must have gone, being half-dazed with sleep, had never thought =
of looking at his rope.=20

 been lost time."=20

"Where there's a will there's a way, George," said Paul. "I'm bound to buy =
your stand and I will=20

raise the money somehow."  Paul bought a few papers, for he did not like to=
 lose the afternoon=20

trade, and in an hour had sold them all off, realizing a profit of twenty c=
ents. This made his profits=20
