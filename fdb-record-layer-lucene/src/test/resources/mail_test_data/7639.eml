philodendron monstera they find inside?"  "The Kernogan wench is not at the Rat Mort yet," quoth Chauvelin drily, "and you have refused to lend a hand in having her conveyed Billie would understand these things better when he was older.

more than he had ever dared and risked before.  Chauvelin was finding a grim pleasure in 

reviewing the situation, in envisaging the danger of failure which he knew lay in wait for him, 

unless he too was able to call to his aid all the astuteness, all the daring, all the resource of his 

own fertile brain. He studied his colleague's face keenly--that sullen, savage expression in it, the 

arrogance, the blundering vanity. It was terrible to have to humour and fawn to a creature of that 

stamp when all one's hopes, all one's future, one's ideals and the welfare of one's country were at 

stake.  But this additional difficulty only served to whet the man's appetite for action. He drew in a 

long breath of delight, like a captive who first after many days and months of weary anguish scents 

freedom and ozone. He straightened out his shoulders. A gleam of triumph and of hope shot out of 

his keen pale eyes. He studied Carrier and he studied Lalouet and he felt that he could master 

them both--quietly, diplomatically, with subtle skill that would not alarm the proconsul's rampant 

self-esteem: and whilst this coarse-fibred brute gloated in anticipatory pleasure over the handling 

of a few thousand francs, and whilst Martin-Roget dreamed of a clumsy revenge against one 

woman and one man who had wronged him four years ago, he--Chauvelin--would pursue his work 

of striking at the enemy of the Revolution--of bringing to his knees the man who spent life and 

fortune in combating its ideals and in frustrating its aims. The destruction of such a foe was worthy 

a patriot's ambition.  On the other hand some of Carrier's bullying arrogance had gone. He was 

terrified to the very depths of his cowardly heart, and for once he was turning away from his 

favourite Jacques Lalouet and inclined to lean on Chauvelin for advice. Robespierre had been 

known to tremble at sight of that small scarlet device, how much more had he--Carrier--cause to 

be afraid. He knew his own limitations and he was terrified of the assassin's dagger. As Marat had 

perished, so he too might end his days, and the English spies were credited with murderous 

intentions and superhuman power. In his innermost self Carrier knew that despite countless 

failures Chauvelin was mentally his superior, and though he never would own to this and at this 

moment did not attempt to shed his over-bearing manner, he was watching the other keenly and 

anxiously, ready to follow the guidance of an intellect stronger than his own.   III  At last Carrier 

elected to speak.  "And now, citizen Chauvelin," he said, "we know how we stand. We know that 

the English assassins are in Nantes. The question is how are we going to lay them by the heels." 

Chauvelin gave him no direct reply. He was busy collecting his precious papers together and 

thrusting them back into the pocket of his coat. that seemed to indicate a feeling that the question 

was absurd.  "O yes," answered the boy quite coolly.  "I've been in love with brother Archie ever 

since I can remember."  Jenkins looked at his little friend with a still more complicated knot of 

puzzlement in his eyebrows, for he felt that Billie was scarcely fitted by years or experience to be a 

useful confidant.  After resting his hands on his knees, and his eyes on the ground, for some time, 

he again made up his mind and turned to Billie, who sat with his large eyes fixed earnestly on the 

countenance of his tall friend, wondering what perplexed him so much, and waiting for further 

communications.  "Little Bill," said Jenkins, laying a large hand on his small knee, "in course you 

can't be expected to understand what I wants to talk about, but there's nobody else I'd like to 

speak to, and you're such a knowin' little shaver that somehow I felt a kind of--of notion that I'd like 

to ask your advice--d'ee see?"  "I see--all right," returned Billie; "though I wonder at such a man as 

you wanting advice from the like of me.  But I'll do what I can for you, Jenkins, and perhaps I know 

more about the thing that troubles you than you think."  "I'm afraid not," returned the seaman, with 



a humorous twinkle in his eye.  "You see, Billie, you never wanted to get spliced, did you?" 

"Spliced!  What's that?"  "Well, I should have said married."  "O no!  I don't think the thought of that 

ever did occur to me.  I'm sorry, Jenkins, but I really cannot give you advice on that subject." 

"H'm!  I'm not so sure o' that, Little Bill.  You're such a practical little chap that I do believe if you 

was put to it you'd be able to-- see, now.  If you happened to want to marry a nice little gal, what 

would you do?"  "I would ask her," said Little Bill, promptly.  "Jus' so; but that is what I have not got 

courage to do."  Jenkins laughed at the expression of blazing surprise with which the boy received 

this statement.  "Have not got courage!" he repeated; and then, after a pause--"Have all the 

stories you have told me, then, been nothing but lies!"  "What stories, Billie?"  "Why, such as that 

one about the pirates in the Java seas, when ten of them attacked you and you were obliged to kill 

four, and all the rest ran away?"  "No, Billie--that was no lie: it was quite true.  But, then, these 

blackguards were cowards at bottom, and they saw that I'd got a brace o' double-barrelled pistols 

in my belt, and was pretty well up in the cutlass exercise."  "And that time when you led a storming 

party against the fort in South America, and was the only one left o' the party, and fought your way 

all alone in through the breach till the troops came up and carried you on with a rush, and--and--

was all about that untrue?"  "Not a bit of it, Billie, though I wouldn't have you think I

"It is through the Kernogan woman that we can get hold of him."  "How?"  "Where she is, there will 

the Englishmen be. They are in Nantes for the sole purpose of getting the woman and her father 

out of your clutches...."  "Then it will be a fine haul inside the Rat Mort," ejaculated Carrier with a 

chuckle. "Eh, Jacques, you young scamp? You and I must go and see that, what? You have been 

complaining that life was getting monotonous. Drownages--Republican marriages! They have all 

palled in their turn on your jaded appetite.... But the capture of the English assassins, eh?... of that 

League of the Scarlet Pimpernel which has even caused citizen Robespierre much uneasiness--

that will stir up your sluggish blood, you lazy young vermin!... Go on, go on, citizen Chauvelin, I am 

vastly interested!"  He rubbed his dry, bony hands together and cackled with glee. Chauvelin 

interposed quietly:  "Inside the Rat Mort, eh, citizen?" he queried.  "Why, yes. Citizen boastin' 

about it.  I only gave you the bare facts, which, like bare poles, is as much as a ship can stand 

sometimes."  "An' that time you jumped overboard in Port Royal among the sharks to save the 

little girl?"  "That's a fact, if ever there was one," said the seaman quickly, "for the dear child is 

alive this good day to swear to it if need be."  "Yet you tell me," continued Little Bill, "that you have 

not the courage to ask a nice little girl to marry you?"  "That's exactly how the matter stands, 

Billie."  It was now Billie's turn to look perplexed.  "Who is this nice little girl?" he asked abruptly, as 

if the answer to that question might help to explain the enigma.  "Well--it's Elise Morel; an', mind, 

not a soul knows about that but you an' me, Little Bill."  "But--but Elise is _not_ a little girl.  She's a 

big woman!"  Jenkins laughed as he explained that seamen sometimes had a habit-- mistaken, it 

might be--of calling even big women "nice little 


_
the Rat Mort, doesn't he?"  "He does."  "And you say that where the Kernogan woman is there the 

Englishmen will be...."  "The inference is obvious."  "Which means ten thousand francs from that 

fool Martin-Roget for having the wench and her father arrested inside the Rat Mort! and twenty 

thousand for the capture of the English spies.... Have you forgotten, citizen Chauvelin," he added 

with a raucous cry of triumph, "that commandant Fleury has my orders to make a raid on the Rat 

Mort this night with they chanced to be fond of them.  "And are you _really_ afraid to ask Elise to 

marry you?" asked the boy, earnestly.  "I suspect that's what's the matter wi' me," replied the 

sailor, with a modest look.  "I always thought that nothing could frighten you," said Billie, in a 

somewhat disappointed tone, for it seemed to him as if one of his idols were shaking on its 

pedestal.  "I can't understand it, for _I_ would not be afraid to ask her--if I wanted her."  At this 

Jenkins again laughed, and said
