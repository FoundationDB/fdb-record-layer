t _
Finally he got up, and going to a crack in the cellar wall, sniffed the bre=
eze, which came in quite=20

freely.  This was always his way when he wanted to find out what was going =
on.  His nose was a=20

much surer guide in most matters than his eyesight.  What the fresh spring =
wind told him was=20

evidently to his liking, for his tongue lolled out, his mouth dripped saliv=
a, and he went at once to=20

the trap-door leading upstairs, and pushed it open with his shoulder.  In t=
he cozy farmhouse=20

kitchen, an event that fills the heart of the average country boy or girl w=
ith delight, was in progress.=20

Upon the kitchen range was placed a large galvanized iron syrup-pan. In it =
was three or four=20

inches of golden maple syrup, which danced and steamed and broke in little =
mountains of yellow=20

bubbles, something the color of sunlight.  This was the amber toll from the=
 rock-maple, discovered=20

long ago by the Indian, whose primitive methods have been so greatly improv=
ed upon by the white=20

man.  But there are still very remote places in Canada, where the old-fashi=
oned slash in the tree,=20

into which a wedge is driven, has not been superseded by spiles and buckets=
.  Several of the=20

neighborhood children were gathered at the farmhouse kitchen and jollity ra=
n high.  Suddenly the=20

door leading to the wood-shed flew open, and there in the doorway stood Bla=
ck Bruin.  With a=20

shout of delight they rushed upon him, eager to greet and caress their wild=
erness pet.  For a week=20

or two, as usual when coming forth from his long sleep, Black Bruin was rat=
her inactive, and did=20

not want much to eat; but by degrees his spirits returned, and it was evide=
nt from the size and=20

strength now acquired, that he was to be more of a rogue and bother than he=
 had ever been=20

before.  But even his warmest admirers, the neighborhood children, who alwa=
ys took his part, no=20

matter what he did, were not prepared for his next antic.  Of course it was=
 impossible for his=20

friends, who had not been sleeping and going without food for several month=
s, to say just how=20

hungry the culprit was, or how strong the blood lust was upon him.  There h=
ad been pig-killing at=20

the farmhouse, and the bear had eaten some of the refuse meat.  This had on=
ly whetted his=20

appetite for more, so he did some pig-killing on his own account.  One morn=
ing a neighboring=20

farmer, very much excited, rushed into the yard and accused Black Bruin of =
stealing a small pig=20

that morning from his sty.  Although the family protested stoutly that he m=
ust be mistaken, a=20

search of the premises showed that their pet was missing.  The bear's maste=
r thought best to=20

settle for the pig, but even then the neighbor was much put out, and promis=
ed to try the effect of a=20

rifle upon the thief the next time he should appear.  The marauder did not =
return to the farmhouse=20

all that day, but came slinking home late in the evening and went at once t=
o his den in the wood-

shed.  Again he was chained to the maple in the front yard, and forced to l=
ive the life of a prisoner.=20

But he was now getting so strong that any ordinary collar would not hold, a=
nd he soon broke away=20

and again went upon a foraging expedition.  This time his choice was mutton=
, and his master had=20

to pay for a pet sheep that he had taken from a neighbor's back yard.  This=
 was getting serious,=20

and the bear's master was thinking of corresponding with the keeper of a zo=
o or menagerie, to see=20

if he could give his troublesome pet away, when Pedro Alsandro appeared upo=
n the scene, and=20

the whole tenor of Black Bruin's life was changed.  Pedro was an Italian pe=
ddler, carrying two=20

large packs.  He was a small man with a swarthy olive-colored skin, and dar=
k beady eyes, set=20

rather too close together.  He appeared one warm April morning, and in the =
usual lingo of his kind,=20

invited the good people at the farmhouse to "buy something."  When his pack=
 had been=20

overhauled and a few small purchases concluded, the peddler noticed Black B=
ruin, and he at once=20

took his fancy.  His greed was also appealed to by seeing the bear perform =
his tricks. Pedro had=20



once owned a dancing-bear, but it had run away from him to escape harsh tre=
atment.  "Why=20

should I lug these heavy packs about," he thought, "when I could make twice=
 the money, merely=20

by leading this bear from town to town?"  So the Italian set to work to gai=
n the confidence of the=20

bear and as he had had considerable experience with his kind, it was not lo=
ng before he had=20

petted and bribed his way into Black Bruin's good-will.  "You buy someting =
me, I buy someting, this=20

bear," he finally said to the farmer.  This proposition was greeted by some=
 neighbors' children with=20

a chorus of wails and the housewife too objected, but to the farmer, who wa=
s much perplexed to=20

know what to do with the bear, it seemed like quite a Providential opening.=
  "What you do with him,=20

Pedro?" he asked, for he was as much attached to the rogue as he would have=
 been to a dog that=20

he had raised from puppyhood.  "I make heem one fine dancing-bear," replied=
 Pedro, "I teach=20

heem lots treeks.  He jes walk long, eat lots, sleep lots, have good time."=
  "Will you be good to=20

him, Pedro?" asked the housewife, for she hated to think of the bear's havi=
ng any but considerate=20

treatment.  "Y-e-a-r-r--lady," replied Pedro.  "I feed heem much sugar, muc=
h peanut and much=20

banan.  He good bar, I keep heem careful and good."  So Pedro finally left =
a part of the contents of=20

one of his packs in exchange for the bear, and went upon his way with a lig=
hter pack.  In one hand=20

he held a stout rope, the other end of which was fastened in Black Bruin's =
collar.  The poor bear=20

continually looked back and whined as they went down the road, but Pedro co=
axed and bribed him=20

with sugar, that he had brought along for the purpose, until he was out of =
sight of the house.  Once=20

beyond the reach of interference upon the part of his recent master, the It=
alian cut a stout heavy=20

stick and sharpened one end, and with that as a goad, he drove the his guar=
dian was to officiate,=20

and where the foundation was to be laid of the reconciliation of all church=
es in the bosom of the=20

true one. Then, in the afternoon, Lothair had been long engaged to a match =
of pigeon-shooting, in=20

which pastime Bertram excelled. It seemed there was to be a most exciting s=
weepstakes to-day, in=20

which the flower of England were to compete; Lothair among them, and for th=
e first time.  This=20

great exploit of arms was to be accomplished at the Castle in the Air, a fa=
ntastic villa near the=20

banks of the Thames, belonging to the Duke of Brecon. His grace had been of=
fended by the=20

conduct or the comments of the outer world, which in his pastime had thwart=
ed or displeased him=20

in the free life of Battersea. The Duke of Brecon was a gentleman easily of=
fended, but not one of=20

those who ever confined their sense of injury to mere words. He prided hims=
elf on =E2=80=9Cputting down=E2=80=9D=20

any individual or body of men who chose to come into collision with him. An=
d so in the present=20

instance he formed a club of pigeon-shooters, and lent them his villa for t=
heir rendezvous and=20

enjoyment. The society was exquisite, exclusive, and greatly sought after. =
And the fine ladies,=20

tempted, of course, by the beauty of the scene, honored and inspired the co=
mpeting confederates=20

by their presence.  The Castle in the Air was a colossal thatched cottage, =
built by a favorite of King=20

George IV. It was full of mandarins and pagodas and green dragons, and pape=
red with birds of=20

many colors and with vast tails. The gardens were pretty, and the grounds p=
ark-like, with some=20

noble cedars and some huge walnut-trees.  The Duke of Brecon was rather bel=
ow the middle size,=20

but he had a singularly athletic frame not devoid of symmetry. His head was=
 well placed on his=20

broad shoulders, and his mien was commanding. He was narrow-minded and prej=
udiced, but=20

acute, and endowed with an unbending will. He was an eminent sportsman, and=
 brave even to=20

brutality. His boast was that he had succeeded in every thing he had attemp=
ted, and he would not=20

admit the possibility of future failure. Though still a very young man, he =
had won the Derby,=20



training his own horse; and he successfully managed a fine stud in defiance=
 of the ring, whom it=20

was one of the secret objects of his life to extirpate. Though his manner t=
o men was peremptory,=20

cold, and hard, he might be described as popular, for there existed a super=
stitious belief in his=20

judgment, and it was known that in some instances, when he had been consult=
ed, he had given=20

more than advice. It could not be said that he was beloved, but he was fear=
ed and highly=20

considered. Parasites were necessary to him, though he despised them.  The =
Duke of Brecon was=20

an avowed admirer, of Lady Corisande, and was intimate with her family. The=
 duchess liked him=20

much, and was often seen at ball or assembly on his arm. He had such excell=
ent principles, she=20

said; was so straight-forward, so true and firm. It was whispered that even=
 Lady Corisande had=20

remarked that the Duke of Brecon was the only young man of the time who had=
 =E2=80=9Ccharacter.=E2=80=9D The=20

truth is, the duke, though absolute and hard to men, could be soft and defe=
rential to women, and=20

such an exception to a general disposition has a charm. It was said, also, =
that he had, when=20

requisite, a bewitching smile.  If there were any thing or any person in th=
e world that St. Aldegonde=20

hated more than another, it was the Duke of Brecon. Why St. Aldegonde hated=
 him was not very=20

clear, for they had never crossed each other, nor were the reasons for his =
detestation, which he=20

occasionally gave, entirely satisfactory: sometimes it was because the duke=
 drove piebalds;=20

sometimes because he had a large sum in the funds, which St. Aldegonde thou=
ght disgraceful for=20

a duke; sometimes because he wore a particular hat, though, with respect to=
 this last allegation, it=20

does not follow that St. Aldegonde was justified in his criticism, for in a=
ll these matters St.=20

Aldegonde was himself very deficient, and had once strolled up St. James=E2=
=80=99s Street with his=20

dishevelled looks crowned with a wide-awake. Whatever might be the cause, S=
t. Aldegonde=20

generally wound up=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CI tell you what, Bertha, if Corisande m=
arries that follow, I have made up my=20

mind to go to the Indian Ocean. It is a country I never have seen, and Pint=
o tells me you cannot do=20

it well under five years.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI hope you will take me, Grenv=
ille, with you,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Aldegonde,=20

=E2=80=9Cbecause it is highly probable Corisande will marry the duke; mamma=
, you know, likes him so=20

much.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy cannot Corisande marry Carisbrooke?=E2=80=9D s=
aid St. Aldegonde, pouting; =E2=80=9Che is a really=20

good fellow, much better-looking, and so far as land is concerned, which af=
ter all is the only thing,=20

has as large an estate as the duke.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, these things d=
epend a little upon taste,=E2=80=9D said Lady St.=20

Aldegonde.  =E2=80=9CNo, no,=E2=80=9D said St. Aldegonde; =E2=80=9CCorisand=
e must marry Carisbrooke. Your father would=20

not like my going to the Indian Archipelago and not returning for five year=
s, perhaps never=20

returning. Why should Corisande break up our society?=E2=80=94why are peopl=
e so selfish? I never could=20

go to Brentham again if the Duke of Brecon is always to be there, giving hi=
s opinion, and being=20

what your mother calls =E2=80=98straightforward=E2=80=99=E2=80=94I hate a s=
traightforward fellow. As Pinto says, if every=20

man were straightforward in his opinions, there would be no conversation. T=
he fun of talk is to find=20

out what a man really thinks, then contrast it with the enormous lies he ha=
s been telling all dinner,=20

and, perhaps, all his life.=E2=80=9D  It was a favorable day for the Castle=
 in the Air; enough, but not too=20

much sun, and a gentle breeze. Some pretty feet, not alone, were sauntering=
 in the gardens, some=20

pretty lips lingered in the rooms sipping tea; but the mass of the fair vis=
itors, marvellously attired,=20

were assembled at the scene of action, seated on chairs and in groups, whic=
h assumed=20

something of the form of an amphitheatre. There were many gentlemen in=20


_
Instead of coaxing there were henceforth sharp thrusts with the point of th=
e stick and savage=20

blows upon the head.  At first Black Bruin was furious at such treatment, f=
or had he not been=20

spoiled and petted all his life?  He soon saw, however, that this man was a=
 new and terrible=20

creature to be obeyed instantly, and one whose wrath it was not well to pro=
voke by The field was=20

large, not less than forty competitors, and comprising many of the best sho=
ts in England. The=20

struggle therefore, was long and ably maintained; but, as the end approache=
d, it was evident that=20

the contest would be between Bertram, Lothair, and the Duke of Brecon.  Lad=
y St. Aldegonde and=20

Lady Montairy were there and their unmarried sister. The married=20


_
For several hours they journeyed on in this manner, until a small village w=
as reached.  Here the=20

peddler disposed of the remaining goods in his two packs at a country store=
, and went into=20

business as the keeper of a dancing-bear.  That night the two slept in an o=
ld barn, curled down in=20

the hay, and nestled closely together for warmth.  When his deep breathing =
told the bear that his=20

new master was sleeping soundly, he crawled carefully out of their nest and=
 tried to slip away. But=20

with a start Pedro awoke and pulled savagely upon his collar, while with hi=
s stick he prodded him=20

back into his nest.  Truly this was a strange and terrible creature into wh=
ose hands he had fallen.=20

He knew what was going on when he was asleep, as well as when he was awake.=
  There would=20

be no escape from him.  The poor brute did not appreciate the fact that bro=
ther, but Lady=20

Corisande said nothing. At last Bertram missed a bird, or rather his bird, =
which he had hit,=20

escaped, and fell beyond the enclosure. Lothair was more successful, and it=
 seemed that it might=20

be a tie between him and the duke. His grace, when called, advanced with co=
nfident composure,=20

and apparently killed both his birds, when, at this moment, a dog rushed fo=
rward and chased one=20

of the mortally-struck pigeons. The blue-rock, which was content to die by =
the hand of a duke,=20

would not deign to be worried by a dog, and it frantically moved its expiri=
ng wings, scaled the=20

paling, and died. So Lothair won the prize.  =E2=80=9CWell,=E2=80=9D said L=
ady Montairy to Lothair, =E2=80=9Cas Bertram was=20

not to win, I am glad it was you.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd you will not congr=
atulate me?=E2=80=9D said Lothair to Lady=20

Corisande.  She rather shook her head. =E2=80=9CA tournament of doves,=E2=
