ant, able to forage and hunt for himself.  Without training from any parent=
, he learned some of the things that it was necessary for him to know in th=
e fields and forest.  Thus the instinct of his bear would never end. I am q=
uite satisfied with things as they are. What is the kingdom of Scotland to =
me and all these counties? I almost begin to feel that satiety which she sa=
id was inseparable from vast possessions.=E2=80=9D  A letter from Bertram, =
reminding him that he had not dined at _
forward to investigate.  As he advanced, the humming grew louder and presen=
tly a small fury=20

darted out at him.  It was not much larger than a fly, but it gave him such=
 a pin-prick in the nose=20

that he was angry, and so struck it down into the grass, and crushed the li=
fe out of it with his swift=20

paw.  Then he crept closer to the humming and buzzing, which was now quite =
ominous.  Soon=20

more of the little furies came buzzing out, all of which he killed as he ha=
d the first.  When the bee-

hunter had crushed the dozen bees comprising the nest, he dug down to the s=
ecret hidden in the=20

roots of the grass and found that it was much sweeter than the maple syrup =
which they had given=20

him at the farmhouse.  The nest was also full of white eggs or grubs which =
were quite palatable.=20

After that day, Black Bruin was a persistent hunter for bumblebees' nests. =
 From the bumblebees'=20

nest to the hives of the honeybees in the orchard back of the house was a v=
ery natural step, but=20

the farmer had not dreamed that the bear would discover the secret of the s=
mall white houses.=20

One afternoon he heard a great humming of the bees in the orchard, and, thi=
nking they were=20

swarming, put on his bee-veil and went to investigate.  The sight that met =
his eyes filled him with=20

both mirth and wrath.  There upon the ground was one of the hives overturne=
d and pulled apart.=20

Many of the partly filled sections were thus exposed, while others were emp=
ty of both comb and=20

honey.  The thief, who was none other than Black Bruin, was holding up a se=
ction between his=20

paws, while with his supple red tongue he licked out the contents.  Althoug=
h the bees were=20

swarming about him in a black cloud and doing their best to punish the thie=
f, he paid little attention=20

to them but licked away for dear life.  Upon his droll countenance was a lo=
ok of such supreme=20

delight, that the angry farmer ended by laughing heartily; but after that e=
xperience he surrounded=20

the beehives with a stout barbed wire fence.  About the middle of July, or =
perhaps a little later, a=20

neighbor's children took Black Bruin to the blueberry lot.  They had often =
romped and played with=20

him, and he was glad to go, although he could not be coaxed to       CHAPTE=
R 26 When they had=20

arrived at the hotel, Colonel Campian proposed that they should come in and=
 have some coffee;=20

but Theodora did not enforce this suggestion; and Lothair, feeling that she=
 might be wearied,=20

gracefully though unwillingly waived the proposal. Remembering that on the =
noon of the morrow=20

they were to depart, with a happy inspiration, as he said farewell, he aske=
d permission to=20

accompany them to the station.  Lothair walked away with the professor, who=
 seemed in a=20

conservative vein, and graciously disposed to make several concessions to t=
he customs of an=20

ancient country. Though opposed to the land laws, he would operate graduall=
y, and gave Lothair=20

more than one receipt how to save the aristocracy. Lothair would have prefe=
rred talking about the=20

lady they had just quitted, but, as he soon found the professor could reall=
y give him no information=20

about her, he let the subject drop.  But not out of his own mind. He was gl=
ad to be alone and brood=20

over the last two days. They were among the most interesting of his life. H=
e had encountered a=20

character different from any he had yet met, had listened to new views, and=
 his intelligence had=20

been stimulated by remarks made casually, in easy conversation, and yet to =
him pregnant with=20

novel and sometimes serious meaning. The voice, too, lingered in his ear, s=
o hushed and deep,=20

and yet so clear and sweet. He leaned over his mantel-piece in teeming reve=
rie.  =E2=80=9CAnd she is=20

profoundly religious,=E2=80=9D he said to himself; =E2=80=9Cshe can conceiv=
e no kind of society without religion. She=20

has arrived at the same conclusion as myself. What a privilege it would be =
to speak to her on such=20

subjects!=E2=80=9D  After a restless night the morrow came. About eleven o=
=E2=80=99clock Lothair ventured to call on=20

his new friends. The lady was alone; she was standing by the window, readin=
g an Italian=20



newspaper, which she folded up and placed aside when Lothair was announced.=
  =E2=80=9CWe propose to=20

walk to the station,=E2=80=9D said Theodora; =E2=80=9Cthe servants have gon=
e on. Colonel Campian has a particular=20

aversion to moving with any luggage. He restricts me to this,=E2=80=9D she =
said, pointing to her satchel, in=20

which she had placed the foreign newspaper, =E2=80=9Cand for that he=20


_
along in his droll bear manner, often stopping to sniff under a stone or in=
 some corner, where his=20

wild instinct told him that there might be something interesting.  Arrived =
at the berry-field, the=20

children began picking and for a time Bruin sat upon his haunches and watch=
ed them, his red=20

tongue lolling out, for it was a hot mid-summer day.  Finally, one of the c=
hildren picked a handful of=20

berries and offered them to their four-footed companion, thinking it would =
be a good joke upon=20

him.  To their surprise, he not only lapped up the berries with keen satisf=
action, but asked in plain=20

bear language for more.  He was so much pleased with the flavor of the new =
food that he=20

responsible.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt was most kind of you to permit me to acc=
ompany you this morning,=E2=80=9D said Lothair;=20

=E2=80=9CI should have been grieved to have parted abruptly last night.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI could not refuse such a=20

request,=E2=80=9D said the lady; =E2=80=9Cbut do you know, I never like to =
say farewell, even for four-and-twenty=20

hours? One should vanish like a spirit.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen I have erre=
d,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cagainst your rules and=20

principles.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CSay my fancies,=E2=80=9D said the lady, =E2=
=80=9Cmy humors, my whims. Besides, this is not a farewell.=20

You will come and see us. Colonel Campian tells me you have promised to giv=
e us that pleasure.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CIt will be the greatest pleasure to me,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=
=80=9CI can conceive nothing=20


_
put his long red tongue into their pails, and they had to box his ears seve=
rely.  Then he went and=20

sat down a little way off, seemingly much abused.  Soon the children heard =
a noise in a bush near=20

by, as if some one was picking, so they went to investigate.  They found Bl=
ack Bruin standing=20

upon his hind legs, while with both paws and his long tongue he scooped the=
 blueberries into his=20

wide-open mouth.  He was bending and thrashing the bush about to get it whe=
re he wanted it, and=20

did not see that he was observed.  Upon his droll bear face was written dee=
p delight, for another of=20

earth's riches had yielded to his inquisitive nose and paws.  After that he=
 was often one of the=20

party when the children went berrying, but if the berries were scarce they =
preferred to leave him at=20

home.  He was quite independent, however, and often went berrying by himsel=
f.  Blackberries he=20

managed he added, =E2=80=9CWhen do you think I might come?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CWhenever you like,=E2=80=9D said the lady; =E2=80=9Cyou=20

will always find me at home. My life is this: I ride every day very early, =
and far into the country, so I=20

return tamed some two or three hours after noon, and devote myself to my fr=
iends. We are at=20

home every evening, except opera nights; and let me tell you, because it is=
 not the custom=20

generally among your compatriots, we are always at home on Sundays.=E2=80=
=9D  Colonel Campian=20

entered the room; the moment of departure was at hand. Lothair felt the con=
solation of being their=20

companion to the station. He had once hoped it might be possible to be thei=
r companion in the=20

train; but he was not encouraged.  =E2=80=9CRailways have elevated and soft=
ened the lot of man,=E2=80=9D said=20

Theodora, =E2=80=9Cand Colonel Campian views them with almost a religious s=
entiment. But I cannot read=20

in a railroad, and the human voice is=20


_
his tongue, he would growl and look astonished, as much as to say, "Now wha=
t does that mean?  I=20

didn't see a bee about."  Black Bruin also made other interesting discoveri=
es in the pasture. One=20

day, either by chance or design, he turned over a small rotten log and foun=
d that on the under side=20

it was swarming with ants and grubs. Then how his tongue did fly as he lick=
ed them up and how=20

the ants scampered in every direction trying to hide before he should get t=
hem!  But ants and=20

grubs were not the only game under the logs.  One day when he had turned ov=
er a larger log than=20

usual, he was astonished to see a tiny four-footed creature run squeaking o=
ut.  Black Bruin=20

hopped clumsily after the field-mouse.  Pat, pat went his heavy paws, but t=
he mouse ran this way=20

and that, dodging and squeaking, and several times he missed, although by t=
his time he was quite=20

expert with his paws. Finally he landed fairly upon the poor mouse, and its=
 life was crushed out.=20

Then he swooped it into his hungry mouth, and found it much better than gru=
bs and ants.  After=20

that, whenever a mouse ran out from under a log or stone that he overturned=
, he made a=20

desperate effort to get it.  One day while sniffing about a hollow log, as =
was his wont, the bear=20

discovered still a new scent that was neither grubs, ants nor field-mice, s=
o he began tearing the=20

log apart, for it was quite rotten.  He had been at work but a few minutes,=
 when with a great=20

chipping a small striped animal, several times larger than the field-mouse,=
 ran between his legs=20

and scurried away in the grass.  Although much astonished, the bear hurried=
 in hot pursuit.  This=20

little creature, like the mouse, ran hither and thither, dodging and twisti=
ng.  Finally after several=20

misses, he landed his paw squarely upon it and the hunter had bagged his fi=
rst chipmunk.=20

[Illustration: The Bear Hurried in Hot Pursuit]  This game was so much larg=
er than the field-mouse=20

that he thought it well worth while, and after that whenever he scented a c=
hipmunk about a log or=20

stone wall, he would spend an hour, if need be, until he was satisfied that=
 he could not get at it.=20

Finally the summer passed and the autumn came, and the bear-cub followed th=
e children to the=20

woods for chestnuts, beech-nuts and walnuts.  He, too, learned the secret o=
f the sweet meat=20

under the hard exterior. amid the whirl and the whistling, and the wild pan=
ting of the loosened=20

megatheria who drag us. And then those terrible grottos=E2=80=94it is quite=
 a descent of Proserpine; so I=20

have no resources but my thoughts.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd surely that is su=
fficient,=E2=80=9D murmured Lothair.  =E2=80=9CNot when=20

the past is expelled,=E2=80=9D said the lady.  =E2=80=9CBut the future,=E2=
=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CYes, that is ever interesting, but=20

so vague that it sometimes induces slumber.=E2=80=9D  The bell sounded; Lot=
hair handed the lady to her=20

compartment.  =E2=80=9COur Oxford visit,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9Chas be=
en a great success, and mainly through you.=E2=80=9D=20

The colonel was profuse in his cordial farewells, and it seemed they would =
never have ended had=20

not the train moved.  Lothair remained upon the platform until it was out o=
f sight, and then=20

exclaimed, =E2=80=9CIs it a dream, or shall I ever see her again?=E2=80=9D =
      CHAPTER 27 Lothair reached=20

London late in the afternoon. Among the notes and cards and letters on his =
table was a long and=20

pressing dispatch from Mr. Putney Giles awaiting his judgment and decision =
on many points.  =E2=80=9CThe=20

central inauguration, if I may use the term,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Putney Giles=
, =E2=80=9Cis comparatively easy. It is an=20

affair of expense and of labor=E2=80=94great labor; I may say unremitting l=
abor. But your lordship will=20

observe the other points are not mere points of expense and labor. We have =
to consult the=20

feelings of several counties where your lordship cannot be present, at leas=
t certainly not on this=20

occasion, and yet where an adequate recognition of those sentiments which o=
ught to exist=20

between the proprietor and all classes connected with him ought to be secur=
ed. Then Scotland:=20

Scotland is a very difficult business to manage. It is astonishing how the =
sentiment lingers in that=20



country connected with its old independence. I really am quite surprised at=
 it. One of your=20

lordship=E2=80=99s most important tenants wrote to me only a few days back =
that great dissatisfaction=20

would prevail among your lordship=E2=80=99s friends and tenantry in Scotlan=
d, if that country on this=20

occasion were placed on the same level as a mere English county. It must be=
 recognized as a=20

kingdom. I almost think it would be better if we could persuade Lord Cullod=
en, not to attend the=20

English inauguration, but remain in the kingdom of Scotland, and take the c=
hair and the lead=20

throughout the festal ceremonies. A peer of the realm,=20


_
butternuts he could not crack, and as for chestnuts, he wanted them taken o=
ut of their prickly=20

jackets before he could eat them.  Here in the deep woods the bear also dis=
covered several roots=20

which were to his liking, so he was always nosing about in the dead leaves,=
 for if he didn't find=20

nuts, he would find roots.  Thus passed the cubhood of Black Bruin, and, fr=
om would impart=20

something of national character to the proceedings, and this, with a judici=
ous emblazoning on=20

some of the banners of the royal arms of Scotland, might have a conciliator=
y effect. One should=20

always conciliate. But your lordship, upon all these points, and especially=
 with reference to Lord=20

Culloden, must be a much better judge than I am.=E2=80=9D  Lothair nearly=
