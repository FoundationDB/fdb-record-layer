 It must nevertheless=20

be observed, that they must be baked or boiled till all the Gravey is out o=
f them; for the Gravey=20

being in them, will contribute to their spoiling by growing musty, or other=
ways foetid.  We have now=20

Flounders in good Perfection, and besides the common Way of Dressing them, =
either by boiling=20

them, as mention'd in the former Months, they are also sometimes fried, and=
 sometimes broil'd;=20

but the following is after such a manner, as is extremely agreeable, and wi=
ll preserve them good a=20

long time. These, or other Fish fry'd, are kept after the same manner: the =
Receipt I had from a=20

worthy Gentleman, where I eat some in great Perfection.    Pickled Fish. Fr=
om _Aaron=20

Harrington,_ Esq.  Let the Fish be fry'd after the common manner, and when =
they are cold lay=20

them in a Dish, and pour on the following Pickle: Water and Vinegar equal q=
uantities, _Jamaica_=20

Pepper, Pepper and Salt, a little Mace, a few Bay-leaves, and some White-wi=
ne: when these have=20

boiled together, pour the Pickle on the Fish while it is not too hot; these=
 eat extremely well.  Trouts=20

are now in good perfection in the South parts of our Country; that is, wher=
e the Weather has been=20

favourable in the former Month; and then besides the common way of boiling =
them we may have=20

them potted, which will make them as valuable as potted Charrs, which are a=
 sort of Trout.    To=20

pott Trouts. From Mrs. _R. S._ of _Preston_ in _Lancashire._  Scale and cle=
an your Trouts very=20

well, wash them in Vinegar, and slit them down the Back, after which put Pe=
pper and Salt into the=20

Incision, and on their Outsides, and let them lie upon a Dish three Hours; =
then lay them in an=20

earthen glaz'd Pan, with pieces of Butter upon them, and put them in an Ove=
n two Hours, if they=20



are Trouts fourteen Inches long, or less in proportion, taking care to tie =
some Paper close over the=20

Pan. When this is done, take away from them all the Liquor, and put them in=
 a Pot, and as soon as=20

they are quite cold, pour some clarified Butter upon them to cover them: Th=
ese will eat as well as=20

potted Charrs. Some will take out the Bone upon slitting the Back, and thes=
e have been often=20

taken for Charrs; tho' I don't know above two Places where the Charrs are, =
one is a Pool where a=20

River or Brook runs thro' in _Lancashire,_ and the other is in a Pool at _N=
aant,_ within four Miles=20

of _Caernarvon._ But the Charr is of the Trout kind, and it must be a good =
judge in Fish to=20

distinguish one from another; however, there is some small difference, whic=
h the Criticks in fishing=20

take notice of.  Fish may also be kept in Pickle several Weeks, as the Jack=
 and Trout especially=20

are agreeable Varieties.  This time is a proper Season for making a pleasan=
t and strong Wine of=20

_Malaga_ Raisins, which will keep good many Years, and among the best Judge=
s of Wine is much=20

admired; it is not unlike a strong Mountain Wine: at this time also the Rai=
sins are very cheap.    To=20

make Raisin Wine.  Take half a hundred weight of _Malaga_ Raisins, pick the=
m clean from the=20

Stalks, and chop the Raisins small, then put them into a large Tub, and boi=
l ten Gallons of River=20

Water, or such Water as is soft, and pour it hot upon them; let this be sti=
rr'd twice or thrice every=20

Day for twelve Days successively, and then pour the Liquor into a Cask and =
make a Toast of=20

Bread, and while it is hot, spread it on both sides with Yeast or Barm, and=
 put it into the Vessel to=20

the Wine, and it will make it ferment gently, which you may know by its mak=
ing a hissing Noise;=20

during the time of working, the Bung of the Vessel must be left open, and a=
s soon as that is over,=20

stop it up close. This will be fine and fit for Drinking in about four Mont=
hs time; but if you make=20

twice the quantity, it should stand five or six Months before you broach it=
: Observe that you set it in=20

a good Cellar, such as I have mentioned in the Month of _March_, under the =
Article of Brewing.=20

To make Fronteniac Wine.  The foregoing Receipt must be followed in every p=
articular, only when=20

you put it into the Vessel, add to it some of the Syrup of the white Fronte=
niac Grape, which we=20

may make in _England_, tho' the Season is not favourable enough to ripen th=
at sort of Grape; for=20

in a bad Year, when the white Fronteniac, or the Muscadella Grapes are hard=
 and unripe, and=20

without Flavour, yet if you bake them they will take the rich Flavour, whic=
h a good share of Sun=20

would have given them. You may either bake the Fronteniac Grapes with Sugar=
, or boil them to=20

make a Syrup of their Juice, about a Quart of which Syrup will be enough to=
 put to five Quarts of=20

the Raisin Wine. When these have work'd together, and stood a time, as dire=
cted in the foregoing=20

Receipt, you will have a Fronteniac Wine of as rich a Flavour as the _Frenc=
h_ sort, besides the=20

Pleasure of knowing that all the Ingredients are wholesome.  This Month is =
the principal time for=20

Asparagus, which every one knows how to prepare in the common way; but ther=
e are some=20

particulars relating to the fitting them for the Table, which I had from a =
curious Gentleman at=20

_Antwerp,_ which I shall here set down.    To preserve Asparagus.  Cut away=
 all the hard part of=20

your Asparagus, and just boil them up with Butter and Salt, then fling them=
 into cold Water, and=20

presently take them out again and let them drain; when they are cold, put t=
hem in a Gallipot, large=20

enough for them to lie without bending, putting to them some whole Cloves; =
some Salt, and as=20

much Vinegar and Water, in equal quantities, as will cover them half an Inc=
h; then take a single=20

Linnen Cloth, and let it into the Pot upon the Water, and pour melted Butte=
r over it, and keep them=20

in a temperate Place: When you use them, lay them to steep in warm Water, a=
nd dress them as=20

you would do fresh Asparagus. It is to be noted, that in _Holland,_ and mos=
t places abroad, the=20



Asparagus is always white, which is done according to a method that I have =
inserted in my other=20

Works; the method of bringing them to Table the foreign way, is to serve th=
em with melted Butter,=20

Salt, Vinegar, and Nutmeg grated.  The Tops or Heads of Asparagus being bro=
ken in small pieces=20

and boil'd, are used in Soups like green Pease.    Asparagus in Cream. From=
 the same.  Break the=20

Tops of your Asparagus in small Pieces, then blanch them a little in boilin=
