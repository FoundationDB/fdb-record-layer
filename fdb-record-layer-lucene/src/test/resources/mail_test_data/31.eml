philodendron monstera became conscious of a little sensation of thankfulnes=

m?"  "And he is a brother of Uncle Josiah?"  "A half-brother," he replied, =

 She did not seem to sense just what she was doing till her hand touched th=
e cold knob. With a start, as though wakened from a bad _
shillings which were to pay for her ticket she had threepence of her own in=
 her pocket. When she=20

had walked about half an hour, and thought that she had gone a long way, an=
d felt quite sure that=20

she could not be very far from the railway station which led to Rosebury, t=
he Pink awoke, and=20

twisting and turning in her narrow basket began to mew loudly.  "Oh, poor K=
itty Pink," said Daisy,=20

"she must be wanting her supper, poor dear little kitty! I'm not at all hun=
gry myself, but I think I=20

ought to buy a penno'th of milk for my kitty. I'll just go into that shop o=
ver there--I see that they sell=20

bread and milk. Perhaps they'll give me some bread and milk for kitty for a=
 penny, and oh, perhaps=20

they will know if I am near the right railway station for Rosebury."  Summo=
ning up all her courage,=20

for Daisy was naturally a timid child, she ventured into the shop, and havi=
ng asked for some bread=20

and milk for her cat, which was given with a little stare of amusement by a=
 good-natured looking=20

woman, she put her important question in a very faltering voice.  "Rosebury=
, my little dear?" said=20

the shopwoman; "no, I never heard of the place. Is it anywhere near London,=
 love?"  "No," said=20

Daisy; "it's miles and miles away from London. I know the county it's in--i=
t's in Devonshire and a=20

third single costs fifteen shillings, and I have got fifteen shillings in m=
y glove. Now, perhaps, you'll=20

know where it is."  "In Devonshire?" repeated the woman. "And a third singl=
e costs fifteen=20

shillings? Surely, miss, you are not going all that long way by yourself?" =
 "Yes," said Daisy, in a=20

dignified little tone. "I'm obliged to go. Thank you very much for Pussy's =
milk. How much am I to=20

pay? Oh, a penny? Thank you. Good evening."  The Pink was once more shut do=
wn into her=20

basket, and Daisy hurried out of the shop. The good-natured woman stared af=
ter her, and felt half=20

inclined to call her back; but, like many another, she reflected that it wa=
s no on his property. Owing=20

to peculiar circumstances, I put in a provision that there was to be no for=
eclosure so long as the=20

interest was paid. I even went beyond the request which the man made, by in=
cluding another=20

clause which prevents me or my heirs from foreclosing before the expiration=
 of two years after the=20

last payment of interest. Have you followed me closely?"  She nodded.  "Wel=
l, each year the=20

interest has been paid in full up to the last two. As long as it was forthc=
oming I said nothing. I have=20

not mentioned a word of this transaction between the half-brother and me, f=
or I knew his hot=20

temper would get the better of him. He thinks the man was drowned at sea, a=
nd it is best that he=20

continue to think so. I have misled him into the belief that I was foreclos=
ing because of the small=20

loan I made last spring, and I trusted to his usual secrecy and apparent ig=
norance to say nothing=20

about it to any one. But from the arrogant manner he maintained toward me l=
ast night I fear he has=20

said more than is good for him. And I have every reason to think that the m=
eddler is the minister. I=20

doubt not but that is the reason why he has gone to the city to-night, and =
I don't think he has gone=20

alone."  "When must that interest be paid?"  "Before midday, Saturday. The =
other loan does not=20

come due for more than two weeks, but the time was so near that I did not t=
hink of Josiah=20

questioning it."  "Who has been paying the interest on the other loan?"  "I=
 do not know, but it has=20

doubtless been coming from some estate of the father-in-law of Josiah's bro=
ther."  "Why was it=20

dropped?"  "That I cannot tell you. I should have done nothing even now had=
 I not learned that this=20

half-brother has come into that estate through the death of the wife's fath=
er. I have every reason to=20

believe that he could pay not alone the interest, but the principal as well=
, if he so desired."=20

"Perhaps this half-brother does not know about the inheritance."=20


_
long street, and then stood at a corner where several omnibuses came up. A =
conductor, seeing=20

her wistful little face, jumped down from his stand, and asked her if she w=
anted to go anywhere.=20

"To Rosebury, in Devonshire," said poor little Daisy. "It's fifteen shillin=
gs a single third."  The man=20

smiled at the anxious little face.  "You want to get to Devonshire, missy,"=
 he said. "Then I expect=20

Waterloo's your line, and this here 'bus of mine goes there. Jump in, missy=
, and I'll put you down=20

at the right place."  "I've only got two pennies," said Daisy, "Will two pe=
nnies pay for a drive to=20

Waterloo for me and kitty?" and is hiding from justice."  "But why should y=
ou make Uncle Josiah=20

suffer for what his half-brother did?"  "That is the very thing I am trying=
 not to do. Can't you see=20

where it would place him if I told him the truth?"  "Yes. But I see no reas=
on why you can't let things=20

go on as they have, and forget the unpaid interest."  "I have no power to d=
o that. I put the matter in=20

the hands of my lawyers in order to force the hidden rascal to take action.=
"  "I think it would be=20

best to tell Uncle Josiah all about it, and let him help you find the one w=
ho should pay."  "Such=20

action would be senseless for two reasons: it=20

The man smiled, and said he thought he might manage to take her to Waterloo=
 for that sum.=20

CHAPTER XL.  A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT.   There are little girls of ten years=
 old who in the=20

present day are possessed of a large amount of self-possession. Some of the=
se little maids are, in=20

their own way, quite womanly--they can ask their way without faltering, and=
 they can even walk=20

about alone in a great world like London without losing themselves.  But to=
 this class of self-

possessed little girls Daisy Mainwaring did not belong. She had a charming,=
 babyish little face,=20

and was something of the baby still in the confiding and wistful way in whi=
ch she leaned on others=20

for support. Daisy was, perhaps, in all particulars younger than her years.=
 When at last, after=20

inconceivable difficulties--after being jostled about by an indifferent cro=
wd, and pushed rudely=20

against by more than one grief and pain, and he would be unable to meet the=
 obligation. It was=20

larger than what the place would cover when first made, and with the deteri=
oration in the value of=20

the property it now far exceeds its worth. Then, there is the interest for =
two years."  "Why don't you=20

offer to buy the place, even paying more than the mortgage calls for? It wo=
uld be a kindness."  "I=20

made such an offer through my lawyer, but Josiah refused."  "Then, why not =
cancel it altogether?"=20

"That would be very unbusiness-like," he declared curtly. "But even if I so=
 desired, it would be=20

impossible now. I have permitted my lawyers to use the foreclosure as a thr=
eat, and I'm duty=20

bound to see it through."  "If it is absolutely necessary to go through wit=
h this, I don't see that it=20

would make it any more terrible if we should tell Uncle Josiah the whole st=
ory. It would, at least,=20

save his thinking ill of us.=20


_
the right ticket-office, and did secure her single third to Rosebury, and t=
hen get a very small=20

allowance of room in a crowded third-class carriage her heart was beating s=
o loudly that she=20

almost wondered it did not burst. The great train, however, moved out of th=
e terminus, and Daisy=20

felt herself whirling there is the chance that he might suggest something."=
  "Beth, I'm bound by my=20

word to say nothing. That was the one promise I made to Adoniah."  "Adoniah=
!" exclaimed the girl,=20

her eyes growing wide.  "Yes. I did not mean to speak his name, but it can =
do no harm."  "Why,--

that was the first name----Is he the=20
