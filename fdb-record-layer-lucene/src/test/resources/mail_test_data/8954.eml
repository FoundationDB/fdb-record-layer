than ever that he was the Scarlet Pimpernel--milor's friend--who kept his valiant personality a 

mystery, even to those who owed their lives to him. She had seen the outline of his broad figure, 

she had felt the touch of his hand. Would she recognise these again when she met him in England 

in the happy days that were to come? In any case she thought that she would recognise the voice 

and the manner of speaking, so unlike that of any English gentleman she had known.   V  The 

man who had so mysteriously led Yvonne de Kernogan from the house of Louise Adet to the Rat 

Mort, turned away from the door of the tavern as soon as it had closed on the young girl, and 

started to go back the way he came.  At the angle formed by the high wall of the tavern he paused; 

a moving form had detached itself from the surrounding gloom and hailed him with a cautious 

whisper.  "Hist! citizen Martin-Roget, is that you?"  "Yes."  "Everything just as we anticipated?" 

"Everything."  "And the wench safely inside?"  "Quite safely."  The other gave a low cackle, which 

might have been intended for a laugh.  "The simplest means," he said, "are always the best." 

"She never suspected me. It was all perfectly simple. You are a magician, citizen Chauvelin," 

added Martin-Roget grudgingly. "I never would have thought of such a clever ruse."  "You see," 

rejoined Chauvelin drily, "I graduated in the school of a master of all ruses--a master of daring and 

a past master in the art of mimicry. And hope was our great ally--the hope that never forsakes a 

prisoner--that of getting free. Your fair Yvonne had boundless faith in the power of her English 

friends, therefore she fell into our for a few seconds--which was just as well, for it gave the bull 

time to toss off the horse, turn, and leap over the prostrate man in continuing its flight; but in 

another moment Bourassin was on his feet, soon caught his trembling horse, remounted, and 

continued the chase.  A little further on they saw Peter Davidson's horse put his foot in a badger-

hole, the result of which was that the horse rolled over in one direction, while the expert Peter, 

tumbling cleverly to one side, rolled away in another direction like a Catherine-wheel.  Both horse 

and man arose unhurt, and, like Bourassin, continued the chase.  "Necks ain't easy broke in this 

here country," remarked the seaman, as Archie pushed past him in pursuit of a fat young cow. 

"Not often.  Necks are tough, you see, and ground is mostly soft," cried Archie, as he fired and 

dropped the cow.  "Who's that away to the right, ridin' like a madman after a calf?" asked Jenkins, 

overtaking Archie, who was recharging his gun at the gallop.  "Who--where?" cried the boy, 

looking impatiently round.  "Keep cool, lad!  Whatever condition you chance to be in, whether of 

danger or safety, always keep cool.  For why?--it makes you comfortable, or more fit for action, as 

the case may be.  See, the fellow over there half-hidden by smoke."  "Why, that's Duncan McKay. 

You might know him by his hat."  "I ain't a good judge o' hats," remarked the seaman, as he fired 

at a bull and missed it.  "Ha! that comes o' firin' at long range," he said. "It was at least six yards 

off, an' I can't count on the old blunderbuss beyond five.  Better luck next time!"  "Hallo!  Jenkins, 

did you hear that?"  "What?"  "That 


_
a bird."  "And like a bird she shall struggle in vain after this," said Martin-Roget slowly. "Oh! that I 

could hasten the flight of time--the next few minutes will hang on me like hours. And I wish too it 

were not so bitterly cold," he added with a curse; "this north-westerly wind has got into my bones." 

"On to your nerves, I imagine, citizen," retorted Chauvelin with a laugh; "for my part I feel as warm 

and comfortable as on a lovely day in June."  "Hark! Who goes there?" broke in the other man 

abruptly, as a solitary moving form detached itself from the surrounding inky blackness and the 

sound of measured footsteps broke the silence of the night.  "Quite in order, citizen!" was the 

prompt reply.  The shadowy form came a step or two further  "Very likely, lad.  There's many a 

cropper a-goin' on just now, an' we can't all expect to come off scot-free."  "The voice sounded like 

that of Fergus," said Archie, "but I can see nothing for smoke now.  Is that a man on the ground 

over there?"  "Don't know, Archie.  Out o' the way, lad; there's another chance.  Must get closer 

this time."  The tide of the chase swept on with irresistible fury, and not one of all the band saw 

that the man who had fallen did not rise.  Following close in rear, and profoundly excited with this 

new and wild experience of life, came Little Bill, galloping along on his pony.  The poor boy had 

either greatly benefited by his recent adventures, or a change had taken place in his constitution, 

for he rode with ease,
