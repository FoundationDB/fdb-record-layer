This brief sketch is not intended for an amusing story. It is only a narrative of facts in support of an 

often repeated theory, viz.: that the humblest creatures are worthy of our tender consideration, 

and, when properly treated, will make pleasing returns for the affection we may bestow upon them. 

BLACKAMOOR  By Ruth Landseer  Many will wonder how I managed to keep order in the 

schoolroom and give proper attention to the lessons with three baby woodchucks, a turtle, two 

squirrels and a young crow about the place. My fellow teachers will be inclined to say that the 

children would have eyes and ears for nothing else.  In point of fact it made little difference after 

my pupils became accustomed to the sight and sound of these "pets." Moreover, they were a 

source of endless pleasure and, I think, profit, for I gave little talks upon the habits and history of 

all these creatures, and sought to inculcate sentiments of compassion and love toward all living 

things.  This was my first school, however, and people wondered. The supervisor also wondered, 

and was skeptical. Several of the parents, who did not understand very well, complained to him 

that I kept a menagerie instead of a school. There were some, even, who did not wish to have 

their children taught natural history, because they came home and asked questions. They did not 

like it and deemed it quite unnecessary. They desired to have their children attend strictly to their 

"school studies."  It came about, therefore, that at the end of the second term the position was 

given to another teacher, and for one whole term my occupation was gone.  Yet my former pupils 

lamented so openly and said so much at home, that their small voices wrought a change of 

opinion, and at the beginning of the second year the school was given to me again. The teacher 

who had taken my place said a little spitefully, on leaving, that I had spoiled the school for any one 

else. She was a very worthy young lady, but one of those who scream at the sight of a spider, a 

mouse or a harmless snake.  Blackamoor came to school one morning in July, head downward, in 

the hands of one of my larger boys, named Wiggan Brown, who was a little inclined to thoughtless 

cruelty. On the part of children, indeed, cruelty is usually thoughtless. They are rarely cruel after 

they have been taught to think on the subject.  Wiggan and his older brother had taken 

Blackamoor from a nest in the top of a hemlock-tree. By this time the reader will have guessed 

that Blackamoor was the young crow which became one of our schoolhouse pets.  At first we built 

a pen for him at the farther corner of the schoolyard, where we kept him until he could fly. After 

that he was released, to stay with us or depart. He chose to stay, and during school hours usually 

sat on the ridge of the schoolhouse roof. At night he often accompanied me home, and lingered 

about the farmhouse or barns till school-time the next day. At the recesses he swaggered and 

hopped about with the children at play, often cawing uproariously.  If a dog or cat approached 

during school hours, Blackamoor would cry, _"Har-r-r!"_ from the roof, and drive the intruder away. 

If it was a person, he cried _"Haw!"_ quite sharply, on a different key. If another crow or large bird 

flew past, he turned up an eye and said _"Hawh!"_ rather low. In fact, he kept us posted on all that 

was going on out-of-doors, for we soon came to know most of his signal-cries. The boys would 

glance up from their books and smile when they heard him.  Blackamoor had certain highly 

reprehensible traits. He was thievish, and we were obliged to keep an eye on him, or he would 

steal all our lead-pencils, pocket-handkerchiefs and other small objects. What he took he secreted, 

and was marvelously cunning in doing it. scandal. But don't mind me! I'm innocent. Everybody 

knows me in Putney, and has done this twenty years. I don't know how it would suit you, Mr. 

Henry and Mr. Matthew, as clergymen, to have your own father in prison. That's as may be. But 



justice is justice, and there's too many men going about deceiving simple, trusting women. I've 

often heard such tales. Now I know they're all true. It's a mercy my own poor mother hasn't lived to 

see where I am to-day. As for my father, old as he was, if he'd been alive, there'd have been 

horsewhipping that I do know."  After some rather pointless and disjointed remarks from the 

curates, a sound came from the corner near the door. It was John's cough.  "Better clear out of 

this!" John ejaculated. Such was his first and last oral contribution to the scene.   _In the Bath_ 

Priam Farll was wandering about the uncharted groves of Wimbledon Common, and uttering 

soliloquies in language that lacked delicacy. He had rushed forth, in his haste, without an 

overcoat, and the weather was blusterously inclement. But he did not feel the cold; he only felt the 

keen wind of circumstance.  Soon after the purchase of his picture by the lunatic landlord of a fully 

licensed house, he had discovered that the frame-maker in High Street knew a man who would 

not be indisposed to buy such pictures as he could paint, and transactions between him and the 

frame-maker had developed into a regular trade. The usual price paid for canvases was ten 

pounds, in cash. By this means he had earned about two hundred a year. No questions were put 

on either side. The paintings were delivered at intervals, and the money received; and Priam knew 

no more. For many weeks he had lived in daily expectation of an uproar, a scandal in the art-

world, visits of police, and other inconveniences, for it was difficult to believe that the pictures 

would never come beneath the eye of a first-class expert. But nothing had occurred, and he had 

gradually subsided into a sense of security. He was happy; happy in the untrammelled exercise of 

his gift, happy in having all the money that his needs and Alice's demanded; happier than he had 

been in the errant days of his glory and his wealth. Alice had been amazed at his power of 

earning; and also, she had seemed little by little to lose her suspicions as to his perfect sanity and 

truthfulness. In a word, the dog of fate had slept; and he had taken particular care to let it lie. He 

was in that species of sheltered groove which is absolutely essential to the bliss of a shy and 

nervous artist, however great he may be.  And now this disastrous irruption, this resurrection of the 

early sins of the real Leek! He was hurt; he was startled; he was furious. But he was not surprised. 

The wonder was that the early sins of Henry Leek had not troubled him long ago. What could he 

do? He could do nothing. That was the tragedy: he could do nothing. He could but rely upon Alice. 

Alice was amazing. The more he thought of it, the more masterly her handling of these 

preposterous curates seemed to him. And was he to be robbed of this incomparable woman by 

ridiculous proceedings connected with a charge of bigamy? He knew that bigamy meant prison, in 

England. The injustice was monstrous. He saw those curates, and their mute brother, and the 

aggrieved mother of the three dogging him either to prison or to his deathbed! And how could he 

explain to Alice? Impossible to explain to Alice!... Still, it was conceivable that Alice would not 

desire explanation. Alice somehow never did desire an explanation. She always said, "I can quite 

understand," and set about preparing a meal. She was the comfortablest cushion of a creature 

that the evolution of the universe had ever produced.  Then the gusty breeze dropped and it began 

to rain.

He fell finally into a difficulty with a gang of Italian laborers who were excavating for a new railroad 

line that passed within a quarter of a mile of the schoolhouse. There were fifty-five of these 

Italians, and they had their camp in a grove of pines within plain sight of us. My pupils were afraid 

of these swarthy men, for they jabbered But December rain has a strange, horrid quality of chilly 

persistence. It is capable of conquering the most obstinate and serious mental preoccupation, and 

it conquered Priam's. It forced him to admit that his tortured soul had a fleshly garment and that 

the fleshly garment was soaked to the marrow. And his soul gradually yielded before the attack

with a sheath-knife.  On the whole, I thought it better that my boys should not go to their camp. But 

Blackamoor went there, and indeed became a constant visitor. There were probably titbits to be 

secured about their cooking-fires. For a time he nearly deserted the schoolhouse for the Italian 

camp in the pines, or at least was flying back and forth a great deal, "hawing" and "harring."  All 

appeared to go well for a while. Then one forenoon I heard loud shouts outside, and on going to 

the door, saw a hatless Italian pursuing Blackamoor across the pasture below the house. He was 

a very active young man, and was filling the air with stones and cries.  Blackamoor, however, was 

taking it all easily, flying of the rain, and he went home.  He put his latchkey into the door with 

minute precautions against noise, and crept into his house like a thief, and very gently shut the 

door. Then, in the hall, he intently listened. Not a sound! That is to say, not a sound except the 

drippings of his hat on the linoleum. The sitting-room door was ajar. He timidly pushed it, and 

entered. Alice was darning stockings.  "Henry!" she exclaimed. "Why, you're wet through!" She 

rose.  "Have they cleared off?" he demanded.  "And you've been out without an overcoat! Henry, 

how could you? Well, I must get you into bed at once--instantly, or I shall have you down with 

pneumonia or something to-morrow!"  "Have they cleared off?" he
