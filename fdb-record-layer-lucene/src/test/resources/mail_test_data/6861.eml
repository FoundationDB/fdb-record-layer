Peter was still free, Susie suspected, because in the presence of that wido=

l need, and have reason to _
from shock. But I like the spirit of the girl. She's not the kind that one =
disappointment is going to=20

kill. And prairie life is already doing her good. For she announced this mo=
rning that her clothes=20

were positively getting tight for her. And such clothes they are! Such deli=
cate silks and cobwebs of=20

lace and pale-pink contraptions of satin! Such neatly tailored skirts and s=
hort-vamped shoes and=20

thing-a-ma-jigs of Irish linen and platinum and gold trinkets to deck out h=
er contemptuous little=20

body with. For Susie takes them all with a shrug of indifference. She loves=
 to slip on my oil-stained=20

old hunting-jacket and my weather-beaten old golf-boots and go meandering a=
bout the range.=20

Another revision which I am compelled to make is that while I expected to b=
e the means of=20

cheering Susie up, Susie has quite comfort himself by reading the Psalms, w=
hen a poor man=20

came to the door and begged for a piece of bread. The king gave him half hi=
s last loaf and the little=20

wine left in the pitcher. The beggar vanished; the loaf was unbroken, the p=
itcher brimful of wine;=20

and fishermen came in bringing a rich haul of fish from the river. In the n=
ight St. Cuthbert appeared=20

to the king in a dream and promised him victory. We see at least what notio=
n the generations=20

nearest to him had of the character of Alfred.  At last the heart of the op=
pressed people turned to=20

its king, and the time arrived for a war of liberation. But on the morrow o=
f victory Alfred=20

compromised with the Northmen. He despaired, it seems, of their final expul=
sion, and thought it=20

better, if possible, to make them Englishmen and Christians, and, to conver=
t them=20


_
been the means of rejuvenating _me_. I think I've been able to catch at lea=
st a hollow echo of her=20

youth from her. I _know_ I have. Two days ago, when we motored in to Buckho=
rn with my=20

precious marketing of butter and eggs--and Susie never before quite realize=
d how butter and eggs=20

reached the ultimate consumer--a visiting Odd-Fellows' band was playing a t=
wo-step on the=20

balcony of the Commercial Hotel. Susie and I stopped the car, and while Str=
uthers stared at us=20

aghast from the back seat, we two-stepped together on the main street of Bu=
ckhorn. We just let=20

the music go to our heads and danced there until the crowd in front of the =
band began to right-

about-face and a cowboy in chaps brazenly announced that he was Susie's nex=
t partner. So we=20

danced to our running-board, stepped into our devil-wagon, and headed for h=
ome, in the icy aura=20

of Struthers' sustained indignation.  I begin to get terribly tired of prop=
riety. I don't know whether=20

it's Struthers, or Struthers and Gershom combined, or having to watch one's=
 step so when there=20

are children about one. But I'm tired of being respectable. I'm tired of ho=
lding myself in. I warn the=20

world that I'm about ready for anything, anything from horse-stealing to pu=
tting a dummy-lady in=20

Whinstane Sandy's bed. I don't believe there's any wickedness that's beyond=
 me. I'm a reckless=20

and abandoned woman. And if that cold-blooded old Covenanter doesn't get ho=
me from Calgary=20

pretty soon I'm going buckboard riding with Bud Teetzel!  I've been asking =
Susie if we measure up=20

to her expectations. She said, in reply, that we fitted in to a T. For her =
Uncle Peter, she=20

acknowledged, had already done us in oils on the canvas of her curiosity. S=
he accused me,=20

however, of reveling in that primitiveness which is the last resort of the =
sophisticated--like the log=20

cabins the city folk fashion for themselves when they get up in the Adirond=
acks. And Casa=20

Grande, she further amended, impressed her as being almost disappointingly =
comfortable.  After=20

that Susie fell to talking about Peter. She is affectionately contemptuous =
toward her uncle,=20

protesting that he's forever throwing away his chances and letting other pe=
ople impose on his=20

good nature. It was lucky, their foreign and heathen brethren. We see in th=
is politic moderation at=20

once a trait of national character and a proof that the exploits of Alfred =
are not mythical. By the=20

treaty of Wedmore, the northeastern part of England became the portion of t=
he Dane, where he=20

was to dwell in peace with the Saxon people, and in allegiance to their kin=
g, but under his own=20

laws--an arrangement which had nothing strange in it when law was only the =
custom of the tribe.=20

As a part of the compact, Guthorm led over his Northmen from the allegiance=
 of Odin to that of=20

Christ, and was himself baptized by the Christian name of Athelstan. When r=
eligions were=20

national, or rather tribal, conversions were tribal too. The Northmen of Ea=
st Anglia had not so far=20

put off their heathen propensities or their savage perfidy as to remain per=
fectly true to their=20

covenant: but, on the whole, Alfred's policy of compromise and assimilation=
 was successful. A new=20

section of heathen Teutonism was incorporated into Christendom, and England=
 absorbed a large=20

Norse population whose dwelling-place is still marked by the names of place=
s, and perhaps in=20

some measure by the features and character of the people. In the fishermen =
of Whitby, for=20

example, a town with a Danish name, there is a peculiarity which is probabl=
y Scandinavian.  The=20

transaction resembled the cession of Normandy to Rolf and his followers by =
the Carlovingian King=20

of France. But the cession of Normandy marked the dissolution of the Carlov=
ingian monarchy:=20

from the cession of East Anglia to Guthorm dates a regeneration of the mona=
rchy of Cerdic.=20

Alfred had rescued the country. But the country which he had rescued was a =
wreck. The Church,=20

the great organ of civilization as well as of spiritual life, was ruined. T=
he monasteries were in=20



ashes. The monks of St. Cuthbert were wandering from place to place, with t=
he relics of the great=20

northern Saint. The worship of Woden seemed on the point of returning. The =
clergy had=20

exchanged the missal and censer for the battle-axe, and had become seculari=
zed and brutalized=20

by the conflict. The learning of the Order was dead. The Latin language, th=
e tongue of the Church,=20

of literature, of education, was almost extinct. Alfred=20


_
his mouth. For he was a hopeless espouser of Lost Causes. She inclined to t=
he belief that he=20

should have married young, should have married young and had a flock of chi=
ldren, for he was=20

crazy about kiddies.  I asked Susie what sort of wife Peter should have cho=
sen. And Susie said=20

Peter should have hitched up with a good, capable, who understood the Latin=
 service or could=20

translate a document from the Latin when he became king. Political institut=
ions were in an equal=20

state of disorganization. Spiritual, intellectual, civil life--everything w=
as to be restored; and Alfred=20

undertook to restore everything. No man in these days stands alone, or towe=
rs in unapproachable=20
