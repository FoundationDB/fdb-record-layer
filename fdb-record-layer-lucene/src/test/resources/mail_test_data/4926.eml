"I don't know," was the reply. "There is a 'crush' on at the Weatherfords', but I don't know whether 

Mrs. Blount has accepted for us or not."  "Don't go," he pleaded quickly. "Back out of it some way, 

and give me just this one evening to myself. Won't you do that, Patricia?"  "I'll try," heard the yells
