youth, who was standing close by the window, gazing out through the folds o=
f the curtain on the=20

fine vista of the Loire and the quays which stretched out before him.  "Int=
roduce citizen Martin-

Roget into the ante-room now, Lalouet," he said loftily. "I will hear what =
he has to say, and citizen=20

Chauvelin may present himself at the same time."  Young Lalouet lolled acro=
ss the room,=20

smothering a yawn.  "Why should you trouble about all that rabble?" he said=
 roughly, "it is nearly=20

dinner-time and you know that the chef hates the soup to be kept waiting." =
 "I shall not trouble=20

about them very long," replied Carrier, who had just started picking his te=
eth with a tiny gold tool.=20

"Open the door, boy, and let the two men come."  Lalouet did as he was told=
. The door through=20

which he passed he left wide open, he then crossed the ante-room to a furth=
er door, threw it open=20

and called in a loud voice:  "Citizen Chauvelin! Citizen Martin-Roget!"  Fo=
r all the world like the=20

ceremonious audiences at Versailles in the days of the great Louis.  There =
was sound of eager=20

whisperings, of shuffling of feet, of chairs dragged across the polished fl=
oor. Young Lalouet had=20

already and quite unconcernedly turned his back on the two men who, at his =
call, had and, in=20

memory, the ice and snow vanish; the streams flow as in the days of old; fl=
owers come again to=20

gladden the eyes and--but why trouble you, good reader, with all this?  We =
feel, sadly, that unless=20

you have tasted the northern winter no description, however graphic, will e=
nable you to drink in the=20

spirit of the northern spring.  About this time Okematan, the Cree chief, t=
ook it into his head that he=20

would go a-hunting.  This last word does not suggest to a dweller in the wi=
lderness that crossing of=20

ploughed lands on horseback, and leaping of hedges, etcetera, which it conv=
eys to the mind of an=20

Englishman.  The Cree chief's notion of spring-hunting was, getting into a =
birch-bark canoe, with=20

or without a comrade, and going forth on the lakes and rivers of the wilder=
ness with plenty of=20

powder and shot, to visit the native home of the wild-goose, the wild-duck,=
 the pelican, the plover,=20

and the swan.  For such a trip not much is essential.  Besides the gun and =
ammunition referred to,=20

Okematan carried a blanket, a hatchet, several extra pairs of moccasins, a =
tin kettle in which to=20

boil food, a fire-bag for steel, flint, and tinder, with a small supply of =
tobacco.  On hearing of his=20

intention, Dan Davidson resolved to accompany=20


_
entered the room.  Two chairs were placed in front of the door which led to=
 the private sanctuary--

still wrapped in religious obscurity--where Carrier sat enthroned. The yout=
h curtly pointed to the=20

two chairs, then went back to the inner room. The two men advanced. The ful=
l light of midday fell=20

upon them from the tall window on their right--the pale, grey, colourless l=
ight of December. They=20

bowed slightly in the direction of the audience chamber Dan had by that tim=
e associated so much=20

with the chief that he had learned to speak his language with facility.  In=
deed nearly all the settlers=20

who had a turn for languages had by that time acquired a smattering more or=
 less of Indian and=20

French.  "You see," said Dan to the chief, "there is not much doing on the =
farm just now, and I=20

want to see a little of the country round about, so, if you don't object to=
 my company, I'd like to go."=20

"The Cree=20


_
The whole thing was a farce. Martin-Roget held his lips tightly closed toge=
ther lest a curse or a=20

sneer escaped them. Chauvelin's face was impenetrable--but it is worthy of =
note that just one year=20

later when the half-demented tyrant was in his turn brought before the bar =
of the Convention and=20

sentenced to the guillotine, it was citizen Chauvelin's testimony which wei=
ghed most heavily=20

against him.  There was silence for a time: Martin-Roget and Chauvelin were=
 waiting for the=20

dictator's word. He sat at his desk with the scanty light, which filtrated =
between the curtains,=20

immediately behind him, his ungainly form with the high shoulders and mop-l=
ike, shaggy hair half=20

swallowed up by the surrounding gloom. He was deliberately keeping the othe=
r two chief," replied=20

the Indian, with grave courtesy.  Dan wanted to say "All right," but was ig=
norant of the Cree=20

equivalent for that familiar phrase; he therefore substituted the more sobe=
r and correct, "It is well."=20

"But," said he, "you must not call me a Paleface chief, for I am only an or=
dinary man in my own=20

land--what you would call one of the braves."  "Okematan is thought to have=
 a good judgment=20

among his people," returned the Indian, "though he has not the snows of man=
y winters on his=20

head, and he thinks that if Dan'el had stayed in the wigwams of his people =
beyond the Great Salt=20

Lake, he would have been a chief."  "It may be so, Okematan, though I doubt=
 it," replied Dan, "but=20

that is a point which cannot now be proved.  Meanwhile, my=20
