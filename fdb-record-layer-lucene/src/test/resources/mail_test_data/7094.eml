philodendron monstera presently, I caught the noise of gentle snoring. Just=
 then,--some one sneezed."  "Yes," said Harold; "I tried to smother it, but=
 I could not do so."  "By that sneeze I knew certainly that this was your b=
edroom, and that the other must be the pantry. I kept very quiet, and there=
 was no more everything."  A faint tinge suffused Lady Broadhem's cheek as =
she said, "What more do you want to know?"  "Exactly what money you possess=
, and exactly how it is invested."  "I don't see that that is at all necess=
ary. Here is Spiffington's letter, from which you will see how much I must =

"I guess what you mean," said the Red King hastily. "We have that Book in m=
y kingdom, too, of=20

course. We honor it highly,--do not think otherwise! We have it in the chur=
ches, and bind it in gold,=20

and keep it as something curious and old. But we do not often read it--why =
should we? A peace=20

book has no message for our brave and warlike people. To think so is absurd=
!"  "Oh!" said Harold.=20

"Well," continued Red Rex; "after a long, long time the streets were quite =
empty. Presently I heard=20

the chimes of midnight. Then I crept out of my hiding-place and stole along=
 the High Street, of=20

which you had told me, till I came to the butcher's shop. Beside it, sure e=
nough, was a little cottage=20

with a thatched roof which I knew must be yours. The window was open, and I=
 looked in; no one=20

about. The door was unlocked, and in I went. What carelessness!"  "We never=
 lock our doors in=20

Kisington," said Harold. "We think it would be rude not to trust our good n=
eighbors, who trust us."=20

"Huh!" grunted the Red King. "In my Kingdom every door is double-barred, lo=
cked and bolted=20

beside. He who trusts nobody is never disappointed,--so I say."  "I should =
hate to live in that kind=20

of Kingdom," murmured Harold. he says how could he know that President Davi=
s would replace=20

Johnston by Hood."  "Very tiresome of Davis: but you should have employed m=
ore than one=20

broker," I remarked. "Persons of limited capital and speculative tendencies=
 should operate=20

mysteriously. Your right hand should not know what your left hand is doing.=
"  "Hush, Frank! you=20

can surely be business-like without being profane. I was completely in Spif=
fy's hands; Lady=20

Mundane told me she always let him do for her, and"--here Lady Broadhem low=
ered her voice--"I=20

_know_ he has access to the best sources of information. I used to employ S=
taggerton, but he is=20

so selfish that he never told me the best things; besides which, of course,=
 I was obliged to have=20

him constantly to dinner; and his great delight was always to say things wh=
ich were calculated to=20

shock my religious friends. Moreover, he has lately been doing more as a pr=
omoter of new=20

companies than in buying and selling. Now Spiffy is so very useful in socie=
ty, and has so much=20

tact, that although there are all kinds of stories against him, still I did=
 not think there was any=20

sufficient reason to shut him out of the house. There was quite a set made =
against the poor little=20

man=20


_
know what happened next," he went on, continuing the Red King's story. "You=
 fumbled along the=20

wall with a noise like a mouse. You stepped on a creaky board."  "I crossed=
 the kitchen on tiptoe,"=20

said Red Rex. "I challenge any man of my size to go more softly. Not a soun=
d in the little house;=20

no trace of you. My dark lantern showed me two doors. I knew one must lead =
to the pantry,--but=20

which? Do you know what I did? Ah, I am clever! I put my ear to each door i=
n turn. At one I time--

worldly people are so hard and uncharitable; so, partly for the sake of his=
 aunt, Lady Spiffington,=20

who was my dear friend, and partly, indeed, because Staggerton had really b=
ecome useless and=20

intolerable, I put my affairs entirely into Spiffy's hands."  "And the resu=
lt is?" I asked.  "That I must=20

pay up L27,000 to-morrow," said Lady Broadhem, with the impenitent sigh of =
a hardened criminal.=20

"You should have kept his lordship to act as a check on the Honourable=20
