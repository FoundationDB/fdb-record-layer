Ten minutes later, his mother went into his bedroom to see if he was nearly dressed. Imagine how annoyed she was to find him still asleep.  "Bobby, Bobby, get up at once. I _
read him this, which is of an importance. If you read as well as I have heard you do ere now, I 

think he will pause in his work of destruction, at least until the story's end."  Harold took the book, 

wondering. "I will try my best, sir," he promised simply.    III. RED REX  A committee of the First 

Citizens led Harold to the city gate. He wished to say good-bye to his mother, and to Richard and 

Robert; but there was no time. Presently a watchman raised a white flag above the wall. 

Thereafter the noise of the besiegers ceased.  "A truce, ho!"  "What message from the besieged?" 

"One comes to parley with your King."  "Let him come forth, under the flag of truce. He will be 

safe."  Bearing the white flag in one hand and the gorgeous book in the other, Harold stepped 

outside the gate. The foreign soldiers stared to see so young a messenger, and some of them 

would have laughed. But Harold held up his head proudly and showed them that he was not 

afraid, nor was he to be laughed at.  "I am the messenger. Pray bring me to the King," he said with 

dignity.  A guard of fierce-looking soldiers took him in charge and marched him across the 

trampled sward, between the ranks of the army, until they came to a little hillock. And there Harold 

found himself standing in front of a huge man with bristling red hair and beard, having a mighty 

arm bound with iron. His eyes were wild and bloodshot. He sat upon the hillock as if it were a 

throne, and held a wicked-looking sword across his great knees, frowning terribly.  "Well, who are 

you, and what do you want with me?" growled the Red King. "A queer envoy this! A mere boy!" 

"The City Fathers have sent me to read you something, please Your Majesty," said Harold, trying 

to look brave, though his knees were quaking at the awful appearance of the War-Lord.  "Is it a 

war message?" asked Red Rex, eyeing the red-and-gold book suspiciously.  "You must hear and 

judge," answered Harold.  "Very well," grumbled the Red King. "But waste no time. Begin and 

have done as quickly as may be."  Harold began to read from the red-and-gold book; but he had 

not gone far when Red Rex interrupted him.  "Why, it is a tale!" he roared. "Thunder and lightning! 

Do they think this is a child's party? Go home with your story-book to your nursery and leave me to 

deal with your city in warrior fashion."  "I come from no nursery!" protested Harold, squaring his 

shoulders. "I am no molly-coddle. No boy can beat me at any game. I am instructed to read you 

this, and I must do so, unless you break the truce and do me harm."  "Who ever heard the like of 

this!" thundered Red Rex. "Here am I making real war, and this boy interrupts me to read a tale! 

What a waste of time! I read nothing, boy. War dispatches are all I have taste for. Does this 

concern war?"  "It has everything to do with this war," said Harold truthfully. "It is very important, 

and they say I read rather well."  "When did you learn to read rather well?" questioned the Red 

King sulkily. "I never learned to read well, myself, and I am thrice your age. I never have had time. 

At your years I was already a soldier. Fighting was the only sport I cared for. Reading is girls' 

business."  "A lot of good things are girls' business, and boys' business, too," said Harold loyally. 

"But please hear me read about the fight, Your Majesty."  "About a fight;--it is a long time since I 

heard a story about a fight, written in ink," said the Red King musingly. "But I have myself seen 

many fights, written in red blood."  "This is a story different from any you ever read," said Harold. 

"It is a story no one ever heard read before, outside Kisington. Will Your Majesty permit that I 

begin?"  Red Rex hummed and hawed, hesitated and frowned. But he was a curious King, as well 

as a savage one, and his curiosity triumphed. "What ho!" he shouted to his guard at last. "Let 

there be a truce until I give word to resume the fighting. I have that which claims my attention. Boy, 

I will hear the story. Plant the flag of truce upon this hillock and sit down here at my feet. Now!" He 



unfastened his belt and sword, took off his heavy helmet and made himself comfortable, while his 

men lolled about in the grass near by. Harold seated himself at the feet of the Red King, as he was 

bidden; and opening the red-and-gold book began to read in his best manner the story of _The 

Dragon of Hushby_.    IV. THE DRAGON OF HUSHBY, PART I  Long, long ago, in the days when 

even stranger things befell than we see nowadays, travelers brought news to the little town of 

Kisington-by-the-Sea. They said that the terrible Dragon of Hushby had wakened again from his 

fifty years' nap; had crept out of his cave in the mountain, and was terrifying the country as he had 

done in the grandfathers' times. Already he had destroyed ten horses; had eaten one hundred 

head of cattle, six fair maidens, and twelve plump little children. Besides which he had killed three 

brave men who had dared to fight with him. But now no one ventured near the cave where the 

dreadful creature lived, and the land was filled with horror for which there seemed to be no hope of 

relief.  [Illustration: HAROLD BEGAN TO READ FROM THE RED-AND-GOLD BOOK]  Moreover, 

so the travelers said, the King proclaimed that whoever should put an end to the terror of Hushby 

might ask of his sovereign whatever reward he chose, even the hand of the King's daughter. Now 

when this news came to Kisington there was great excitement. For Hushby Town was not far 

distant from the market-place of Kisington. People gathered in groups talking in whispers of the 

Dragon, and looking fearfully out of the corners of their eyes as they spoke. Who could tell when 

the creature might wander in their direction, as the Chronicles recorded that he had done once, 

long ago, when he had destroyed the daughter of him who was Lord Mayor at that time? Kisington 

had special reasons, you see, for longing to hear that a hero had conquered the Dragon.  Of all 

the people in Kisington who heard the news, the one most excited thereby was a lad named 

Arthur. He did not look like a hero, for he was short, and small, and ugly. For this reason no one 

had ever thought him especially brave. Most people expect heroes to be great, big men. Arthur 

was held to be of little account in Kisington. But though he was a little fellow, he had a great heart. 

All his life he had loved tales of bravery and adventure, and he longed to be a. hero. Besides, he

_
it would be a. fine thing to marry the King's daughter, who, like all princesses, must be very 

beautiful.  Arthur lived by himself in a castle which had once belonged to his uncle. Now that uncle 

had been an Amateur Magician; that is, he was always doing things with flaring fires and queer 

bottles, messes of strange liquids and horrid smells,--hoping to learn how to turn old iron into gold, 

or to discover some other useful secret. No one ever heard, however, of his accomplishing 

anything; until one day, with a _Bang!_ he blew himself up.` And every one heard of that. His will 

gave all his Amateur-Magical stuff to Arthur--all his forges and bellows and bulbs and bottles, the 

syrups and nasty smells. But Arthur cared nothing at all about Amateur Magic, and scarcely ever 

went into the desolate tower in one wing of the castle, where his uncle's laboratory was gathering 

dust.  But after news came about the Dragon of Hushby, things were different. An idea had come 

into Arthur's head. "Oh, dear!" he said to himself. "If only I could find something which would make 

me big! Only a giant could kill the Dragon of Hushby, he is so huge and terrible. Perhaps my uncle 

may have discovered a secret which would turn me into a giant!"  Eagerly he hurried to the 

deserted room. Everything was draped in dusty cobwebs, and when he opened the door the rats 

went scuttling in all directions. All among the bottles and boxes and books and bundles he sought 

and sought for some discovery which should help him. But though he found many other curious 

things, he found not what he sought. Though he poked in every dark corner and read carefully the 

labels on every phial, and the recipes in every book, he found no Secret for Growing Big. He could 

have learned, had he wished, "How to Make a Silk Purse Out of a Sow's Ear"; "How to Make a 

Horse Drink"; "How to Make an Empty Sack Stand Upright," and other very difficult things. But all 

these secrets were of no use to Arthur, and he thought that his uncle had wasted much valuable 

time in making these discoveries. Which, indeed, was true.  Arthur grew more and more 

discontented every day. But one morning, quite by accident, he hit his elbow against a hidden 

spring in a    THE BEARS' CAVE                           9    BOBBY GROWS UP                           11

51     Bobby Bear     THE BEARS' CAVE   Over where the sun sank to rest every night like a great 

ball of fire, there lived three brown bears.  There was Father Bear, with a great, gruff voice. And 

Mother Bear, whose voice, while not so loud nor so gruff as father's, yet was not nice for little boys 

and girls to hear. And there was little Bobby Bear. His voice was sweet, for he was very young.  All 

of the bears had lovely, brown skins. When the sun shone on them they looked like rich, brown 

velvet. And when they were curled up, asleep, they looked like great balls of brown fur.  The bears' 

eyes were big, and round, and black as coals.  They had great, strong claws on all their paws. 

With bears, you know, hands and feet are very much alike, and are called forefeet and hindfeet--or 

front feet and back feet. So instead of finger nails and toe nails they have claws.  But you are 

anxious to know something about Bobby Bear's home. It was in a great, gloomy cave. Only the 

front part had the sunshine. Away in the back part it was dark, pitch dark, like night.  The bears 



didn't mind this, of course, for when night came, instead of reading books like children and grown-

ups, they just went right off to sleep.     BOBBY GROWS UP   Bobby Bear was growing to be a big 

bear, fast. Soon he would be a big-boy bear.  Most of the time he stayed at home with Mother 

Bear, helping her in the house when he wasn't playing.  It wasn't much

knot-hole of the wall in the dusty laboratory. Immediately a secret panel opened, and there behind 

it was a secret cupboard. In the cupboard was the secretest-looking package, wrapped in a velvet 

cloth. Arthur unrolled it eagerly and found a little leather case. When the case was opened, he saw 

inside a bit of glass set in gold, with a handle. It looked quite like a modern reading-glass--only 

reading-glasses were not invented until many, many years later. "What can this be?" said Arthur to 

himself. And taking up the glass he looked through it. Wonderful! Everything suddenly seemed to 

become small--just as it does nowadays when we look through the wrong end of an opera-glass. 

But Arthur had never seen an opera-glass, you know; this was so many hundreds of years ago. 

Arthur looked around the room, and everything had suddenly become so  tiny that it made him 

laugh. In the window a huge spider--as big as his  hand--had been spinning her web. Now she 

was no larger than a dot. A  rat scampered across the floor, and as Arthur looked it shrank to the 

size of a fly! A bird flew past the window, singing, and it grew  smaller as it flew, while its voice 

became tinier and tinier till it  sounded like the bears for company. So he had to play and pretend 

bears were with him.  He would say, "You sit there, Little Gray Bear," or "Now, Little Black Bear, 

you be quiet."  One day Bobby Bear wandered down by the river, lonesome and sad. The rippling 

waters seemed to say to him that some day he would have a little playmate, just like little human 

children had.  And when he was in the forest he would stop and listen to the whispering of the 

trees. They, too, seemed to tell of the time when a little girl would bring a great joy to him--poor, 

lonely, little Bobby Bear.  So, in his own way--the way that all bears have of thinking--he felt sure 

that some day he would not be lonely any more, nor quiet, nor sad.  It may have been that very 

day, while Bobby Bear wandered in the forest, that Jane Bird was thinking of him, too. Such things 

do sometimes happen.  You see, Jane Bird lived with her father and mother, near the great forest 

where the Bear family made their home.  Jane Bird played with the other little children who lived 

near. Such fun as they had--running, jumping, skipping. And they played "school," and "keeping 

house," and pretended they were grown-up people. The days were full of laughter and of joy.

glass from his eye. Instantly everything appeared again of its natural  size--all except the spider 

and the rat and the bird. They remained  tiny as they had seemed through the glass. Arthur had 

magicked them!  "Ho!" cried Arthur. "This is some of my uncle's Amateur Magic. He had, indeed, 

discovered how to make living things grow small. Alas! That helps me little. I am small enough 

now. But if only it worked the other way I might become a giant. What a pity! what a pity! Stay--

perhaps if I reverse the glass something better may be done!"  He was about to turn the glass over 

and raise it to his eye again, when he spied a bit of parchment in the box. On it were scribbled 

some words, in faded ink.  "A Wondrous Device to Make the Living Small. Thrice Neither Jane 

Bird's father, nor Jane Bird's mother nor, of course, Jane Bird herself, knew of what was soon 

going to happen.  They should have feared something, though, for one evening, just at dusk, when 

the sun was going down, away over by the dark woods, could have been seen three great forms. 

These were the bears going home to their cave.     BOBBY BEAR HAS TO HELP IN THE HOUSE 

Early one morning, Bobby was wakened by his mother who called sharply: "Come, it is time to get 

up. You know you must help me with the dishes today. If you want to go with your father to get 

some corn you must look sharp."  My, but Bobby was sleepy, for he had walked so far in the 

woods the day before that he was quite tired out. So when his mother called him, instead of
