towards the south.  Between the oases of Todghra and Ferkla, nothing but st=

 blackish rocks with a=20

uneasy way.  Not for a moment was=20

Mr Preston.  "I should like=20

Mr. Preston.  "I will=20

 Mrs.=20

Montgomery impatiently awaited the return of her husband. Meanwhile she com=
menced packing=20

the single trunk which answered both for her husband and herself. She was g=
etting tired of New=20

York, and anxious to leave for Philadelphia, being fearful lest certain kno=
wn landmark, and finding=20

none started to go back on his trail.  But to his horror the wind which alw=
ays sweeps across the=20

Sahara had covered up his tracks, and on the stony paths which he had passe=
d his feet had left=20

no prints.  Then Amarabat, the first moments of despair passed by, took a l=
ong look at the horizon,=20

tightened his belt, pulled up his slipper heels, covered his precious bowl =
with a corner of his robe,=20

and started doggedly back upon the road he thought he traversed on the dece=
itful path.  How long=20

he trotted, what he endured, whether the fish died first, or if he drank, o=
r, faithful to the last,=20

 sandhills and of suddra=20

completed her packing when Paul rang the doorbell.  The summons was answere=
d by the=20

landlady in person.  "Is Mrs. Montgomery at home?" asked Paul.  "No such la=
dy lives here," was=20

the answer.  It occurred to Paul as very possible that Mr. Montgomery might=
 pass under a variety=20

of names. He accordingly said, "Perhaps I have got the name wrong. The lady=
 I mean is tall. I=20

come with a message from her husband, who is a stout man with black hair an=
d whiskers. He=20

gave me this number."  "Perhaps you mean Mr. Grimsby. He and his wife live =
here."  "Probably=20

that is the name," said Paul.  "I will give Mrs. Grimsby your message," ret=
urned the landlady,=20

whose curiosity was excited to learn something further about her boarders. =
 "Thank you," said=20

Paul; "but it is necessary for me to see the lady myself."  "Well, you can =
follow me, then," said the=20

landlady, rather ungraciously.  She led the way upstairs, and knocked at th=
e door of Mrs. Grimsby,=20

or as Mecca at the time of prayer, and trotting on more feebly (for he was =
born to run), till he sat=20

down beneath the sun-dried bushes where the Shinghiti on his Mehari found h=
im dead beside the=20

trail.  Under a stunted sandarac tree, the head turned to the east, his bod=
y lay, swollen and=20

distorted by the pangs of thirst, the tongue protruding rough as a parrot=
=E2=80=99s, and beside him lay the=20

seven golden fish, once bright and shining as the pure gold when the goldsm=
ith pours it molten=20

from his pot, but now turned black and bloated, stiff, dry, and dead.  Life=
 the mysterious, the=20

mocking, the inscrutable, unseizable, the uncomprehended essence of nothing=
 and of everything,=20

had fled, both from the faithful messenger and from his fish.  But the Khal=
ifa=E2=80=99s parting caution had=20

been well obeyed, for by the tree, unbroken, the crystal bowl still glisten=
