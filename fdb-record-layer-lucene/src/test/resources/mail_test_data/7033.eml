Poor dear Papa!  SALOME.  He must return very soon--he must!  SHEBA.  He mu=
st! In the=20

meantime it is such a comfort to feel that we have no cause for self-reproa=
ch.  SALOME.  But the=20

anxiety is terribly wearing.  SHEBA.  Nothing is so weakening, Salome.  SAL=
OME.  Sheba, dear.=20

SHEBA.  [_Clinging to SALOME._] If I should pine and ultimately die of this=
 suspense I want you=20

to have my workbox.  SALOME.  [_Shaking her head and sadly turning away._] =
Thank you, dear,=20

but if Papa is not home for afternoon tea you will outlive me.  [_Turning t=
owards the window as=20

MAJOR TARVER and MR. DARBEY appear outside._  DARBEY.  [_Outside._] Miss Je=

Jedd!  SALOME.  Sheba! Here are Gerald Tarver and Mr. Darbey!  SHEBA.  Oh, =
the presumption!=20

Open the window and dare them to enter!  [_SALOME unfastens the window._  D=
ARBEY.=20

[_Outside._] Thank you. Don't be shocked when you see Tarver.  _TARVER and =
DARBEY enter,=20

dressed for the Races, but DARBEY is supporting TARVER, who looks extremely=
 weakly._=20

TARVER.  Pardon this informal method of presenting ourselves.  SALOME.  You=
 do well,=20

gentlemen, to intrude upon two feeble women at a moment of sorrow.  SHEBA. =
 One step further,=20

and I shall ask Major Tarver, who is nearest the bell, to ring for help.  [=
_TARVER sinks into a=20

chair._  DARBEY.  [_Standing by the side of TARVER._] There now. The fact i=
s. Miss Jedd, that=20

Tarver is in an exceedingly critical condition. Feeling that he has incurre=
d your displeasure he has=20

failed even in the struggle to gain the race-course. I have taken him to Dr=
. Middleton and I=20

explained that Major Tarver loved with a passion [_looking at SHEBA_] secon=
d only to my own.=20

SALOME.  [_Sitting comfortably on the settee._] Oh, we cannot listen to you=
, Mr. Darbey.  SHEBA.=20

Go on, sir, if you can.  [_The two girls exchange looks._  DARBEY.  The Doc=
tor made a searching=20

examination of the Major's tongue and diagnosed that, unless the Major at o=

lady in question and was accepted, three weeks or a month at the seaside wo=
uld be absolutely=20

imperative. Shall I continue?  SALOME.  Oh, certainly. I am helpless.  SHEB=
A.  We are curious to=20

see to what lengths you will go.  DARBEY.  The pitiable condition of my poo=
r friend speaks for=20

itself.  SALOME.  I beg your pardon--it does nothing of the kind.  TARVER. =
 [_Rising with difficulty=20

and approaching SALOME._] Salome--I have loved you distractedly for upwards=
 of eight weeks.=20

SALOME.  [_Going to him._] Oh, Major Tarver, let me pass; [_holding his coa=
t firmly_] let me=20

pass, I say.  TARVER.  Unless you push me, never!  SHEBA.  Spare me this sc=
ene, Mr. Darbey.=20

[_DARBEY follows SHEBA across the room._  TARVER.  To a man in my condition=
 love is either a=20

rapid and fatal malady, or it is an admirable digestive. Accept me, and my =
merry laugh once more=20

rings through the Mess Room. Reject me, and my collection of vocal music, l=
oose and in volumes,=20

will be brought to the hammer, and the bird, as it were, will trill no more=
.  SALOME.  And is it really=20

I who would hush the little throaty songster?  TARVER.  Certainly. [_Taking=
 a sheet of paper from=20

his pocket._] I have the Doctor's certificate to that effect.  [_Both readi=
ng the certificate they walk=20

into Library._  SHEBA.  Oh, Mr. Darbey, I have never thought of marriage se=
riously.  DARBEY.=20

People never do till they _are_ married.  SHEBA.  But think, only think of =
my age.  DARBEY.=20

Pardon me, Sheba--but what is your age?  SHEBA.  Oh, it is so very little--=
it is not worth electronic=20
