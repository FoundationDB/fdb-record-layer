relation to the passports we were asking from his government to visit the I=

request had made the visit necessary. Several times there were pauses in th=

always he began to repair these gaps in the talk rather bashfully but kindl=

was impersonal and of indifferent interest. He made no sign that the interv=

knew, as well as though a gong had struck, when to go. So we went, and it s=
eemed to me that the=20

Duke put more real enthusiasm into his good-bye than into his welcome. It w=
as half-past five. He=20

had been at work since eight. And perhaps it was fancy, but there seemed to=
 be rising into his=20

bland Italian eye a determination to knock off and take a half holiday.  We=
 noticed that his desk=20

was clean, as clean as General Pershing's or Major Murphy's in Paris, or Pr=
esident Wilson's in=20

Washington. Then it came to us that the king's job, after all, is a desk jo=

yalty, like the policeman's=20

lot, "is not a happy one." Talking it all over, we decided that in the mode=
rn world there is really any=20

the town, much more=20

chance of getting things done. It did not fall to me because of an illness,=
 but a few days later it fell=20

to Henry and Medill to see a real king at Udine. He was living in a cottage=
 a few miles out of town=20

in a quiet little grove that protected him from airplanes. Now Henry's near=

22nd of May, in the savannah at the foot of Duida, a base of four hundred a=
nd seventy-five metres=20

in length; the angle, under which the summit of the mountain appeared at th=
e distance of thirteen=20

thousand three hundred and twenty-seven metres, was still nine degrees. A t=
rigonometric=20

measurement, made with great care, gave me for Duida (that is, for the most=
 elevated peak, which=20

is south-west of the Cerro Maraguaca) two thousand one hundred and seventy-=
nine metres, or=20

one thousand one hundred and eighteen toises, above the plain of Esmeralda.=
 The Cerro Duida=20

thus yields but little in height (scarcely eighty or one hundred toises) to=
 the summit of St. Gothard,=20

or the Silla of Caracas on the shore of Venezuela. It is indeed considered =
as a colossal mountain=20

in those countries; and this celebrity gives a precise idea of the mean hei=
ght of Parima and of all=20

the mountains of eastern America. To the east of the Sierra Nevada de Merid=
a, as well as to the=20

south-east of the Paramo de las Rosas, none of the chains that extend in th=
e same parallel line=20

reach the height of the central ridge of the Pyrenees.  The granitic summit=
 of Duida is so nearly=20

perpendicular that the Indians have vainly attempted the ascent. It is a we=
ll-known fact that=20

mountains not remarkable for elevation are sometimes the most inaccessible.=
 At the beginning=20

and end of the rainy season, small flames, which seem to change their place=
, are seen on the top=20

of Duida. This phenomenon, the existence of which is borne out by concurren=
t testimony, has=20

caused this mountain to be improperly called a volcano. As it stands nearly=
 alone, it might be=20

supposed that lightning from time to time sets fire to the brushwood; but t=
his supposition loses its=20

probability when we reflect on the extreme difficulty with which plants are=
 ignited in these damp=20

climates. It must be observed also that these flames are said to appear oft=
