called Evangelus. And to this day the chief magistrate goes out to that ver=
y spot every month and=20

offers sacrifice to him, and if he does not, he is punished.     CHAPTER II=
I  THE ELEMENTS OF=20

MOTION   1. I have briefly set forth what I thought necessary about the pri=
nciples of hoisting=20

machines. In them two different things, unlike each other, work together, a=
s elements of their=20

motion and power, to produce these effects. One of them is the right line, =
which the Greeks term=20

[Greek: eutheia]; the other is the circle, which the Greeks call [Greek: ky=
klote]; but in point of fact,=20

neither rectilinear without circular motion, nor revolutions, without recti=
linear motion, can=20

accomplish the raising of loads. I will explain this, so that it may be und=
erstood.  2. As centres,=20

axles are inserted into the sheaves, and these are fastened in the blocks; =
a rope carried over the=20

sheaves, drawn straight down, and fastened to a windlass, causes the load t=
o move upward from=20

its place as the handspikes are turned. The pivots of this windlass, lying =
as centres in right lines in=20

its socket-pieces, and the handspikes inserted in its holes, make the load =
rise when the ends of=20

the windlass revolve in a circle like a lathe. Just so, when an iron lever =
is applied to a weight which=20

a great many hands cannot move, with the fulcrum, which the Greeks call [Gr=
eek: hupomochlion],=20

lying as a centre in a right line under the lever, and with the tongue of t=
he lever placed under the=20

weight, one man's strength, bearing down upon the head of it, heaves up the=
 weight.  3. For, as=20

the shorter fore part of the lever goes under the weight from the fulcrum t=
hat forms the centre, the=20

head of it, which is farther away from that centre, on being depressed, is =
made to describe a=20

circular movement, and thus by pressure brings to an equilibrium the weight=
 of a very great load=20

by means of a few hands. Again, if the tongue of an iron lever is placed un=
der a weight, and its=20

head is not pushed down, but, on the contrary, is heaved up, the tongue, su=
pported on the surface=20

of the ground, will treat that as the weight, and the edge of the weight it=
self as the fulcrum. Thus,=20

not so easily as by pushing down, but by motion in the opposite direction, =
the weight of the load=20

will nevertheless be raised. If, therefore, the tongue of a lever lying on =
a fulcrum goes too far under=20

the weight, and its head exerts its pressure too near the centre, it will n=
ot be able to elevate the=20

weight, nor can it do so unless, as described above, the length of the leve=
r is brought to=20

equilibrium by the depression of its head.  4. This may be seen from the ba=
lances that we call=20

steelyards. When the handle is set as a centre close to the end from which =
the scale hangs, and=20

the counterpoise is moved along towards the other arm of the beam, shifting=
 from point to point as=20

it goes farther or even reaches the extremity, a small and inferior weight =
becomes equal to a very=20

heavy object that is being weighed, on account of the equilibrium that is d=
ue to the levelling of the=20

beam. Thus, as it withdraws from the centre, a small and comparatively ligh=
t counterpoise, slowly=20

turning the scale, makes a greater amount of weight rise gently upwards fro=
m below.  5. So, too,=20

the pilot of the love--all that is known; one can take what view one likes =
of it. So far only one=20

incontestable truth has been uttered about love: 'This is a great mystery.'=
 Everything else that has=20

been written or said about love is not a conclusion, but only a statement o=
f questions which have=20

remained unanswered. The explanation which would seem to fit one case does =
not apply in a=20

dozen others, and the very best thing, to my mind, would be to explain ever=
y case individually=20

without attempting to generalize. We ought, as the doctors say, to individu=
alize each case."=20

"Perfectly true," Burkin assented.  "We Russians of the educated class have=
 a partiality for these=20

questions that remain unanswered. Love is usually poeticized, decorated wit=
h roses, nightingales;=20

we Russians decorate our loves with these momentous questions, and select t=
he most=20



uninteresting of them, too. In Moscow, when I was a student, I had a friend=
 who shared my life, a=20

charming lady, and every time I took her in my arms she was thinking what I=
 would allow her a=20

month for housekeeping and what was the price of beef a pound. In the same =
way, when we are in=20

love we are never tired of asking ourselves questions: whether it is honour=
able or dishonourable,=20

sensible or stupid, what this love is leading up to, and so on. Whether it =
is a good thing or not I=20

don't know, but that it is in the way, unsatisfactory, and irritating, I do=
 know."  It looked as though=20

he wanted to tell some story. People who lead a solitary existence always h=
ave something in their=20

hearts which they are eager to talk about. In town bachelors visit the bath=
s and the restaurants on=20

purpose to talk, and sometimes tell the most interesting things to bath att=
endants and waiters; in=20

the country, as a rule, they unbosom themselves to their guests. Now from t=
he window we could=20

see a grey sky, trees drenched in the rain; in such weather we could go now=
here, and there was=20

nothing for us to do but to tell stories and to listen.  "I have lived at S=
ofino and been farming for a=20

long time," Alehin began, "ever since I left the University. I am an idle g=
entleman by education, a=20

studious person by disposition; but there was a big debt owing on the estat=
e when I came here,=20

and as my father was in debt partly because he had spent so much on my educ=
ation, I resolved=20

not to go away, but to work till I paid off the debt. I made up my mind to =
this and set to work, not, I=20

must confess, without some repugnance. The land here does not yield much, a=
nd if one is not to=20

farm at a loss one must employ serf labour or hired labourers, which is alm=
ost the same thing, or=20

put it on a peasant footing--that is, work the fields oneself and with one'=
s family. There is no=20

middle path. But in those days I did not go into such subtleties. I did not=
 leave a clod of earth=20

unturned; I gathered together all the peasants, men and women, from the nei=
ghbouring villages;=20

the work went on at a tremendous pace. I myself ploughed and sowed and reap=
ed, and was bored=20

doing it, and frowned with disgust, like a village cat driven by hunger to =
eat cucumbers in the=20

kitchen-garden. My body ached, and I slept as I walked. At first it seemed =
to me that I could easily=20

reconcile this life of toil with my cultured habits; to do so, I thought, a=
ll=20


_
oar by its handle, which the Greeks call [Greek: oiax], and with one hand b=
ringing it to the turning=20

point, according to the rules of his art, by pressure about a centre, can t=
urn the ship, although she=20

may be laden with a very large or even enormous burden of merchandise and p=
rovisions. And=20

when her sails are set only halfway up the mast, a ship cannot run quickly;=
 but when the yard is=20

hoisted to the top, she makes much quicker progress, because then the sails=
 get the wind, not=20

when they are too close to the heel of the mast, which represents the centr=
e, but when they have=20

moved farther away from it to the top.  6. As a lever thrust under a weight=
 is harder to order in life.=20

I established myself upstairs here in the best rooms, and ordered them to b=
ring me there coffee=20

and liquor after lunch and dinner, and when I went to bed I read every nigh=
t the _Yyesnik Evropi_.=20

But one day our priest, Father Ivan, came and drank up all my liquor at one=
 sitting; and the=20

_Yyesnik Evropi_ went to the priest's daughters; as in the summer, especial=
ly at the haymaking, I=20

did not succeed in getting to my bed at all, and slept in the sledge in the=
 barn, or somewhere in the=20

forester's lodge, what chance was there of reading? Little by little I move=
d downstairs, began=20

dining in the servants' kitchen, and of my former luxury nothing is=20


_
put forth its strength, if the pressure is exerted at the centre, but easil=
y raises the weight when the=20

extreme end of it is pushed down, so sails that are only halfway up have le=
ss effect, but when they=20

get farther away from the centre, and are hoisted to the very top of the ma=
st, the pressure at the=20

top forces the ship to make greater progress, though the wind is no stronge=
r but just the same.=20

Again, take the case of oars, which are fastened to the tholes by loops,--w=
hen they are pushed=20

forward and drawn back by the hand, if the ends of the blades are at some d=
istance from the=20

centre, the oars foam with the waves of the sea and drive the ship forward =
in a straight line with a=20

mighty impulse, while her prow cuts through the rare water.  7. And when th=
e heaviest burdens are=20

carried on poles by four or six porters at a time, they find the centres of=
 balance at the very middle=20

of the poles, so that, by distributing the dead weight of the burden accord=
ing to a definitely=20

proportioned division, each labourer may have an equal share to carry on hi=
s neck. For the poles,=20

from which the straps for the burden of the four porters hang, are marked o=
ff at their centres by=20

nails, to prevent the straps from slipping to one side. If they shift beyon=
d the mark at the centre,=20

they weigh heavily upon the place to which they have come nearer, like the =
weight of a steelyard=20

when it moves from the point of equilibrium towards the end of the weighing=
 apparatus.  8. In the=20

same way, oxen have an equal draught when their yoke is adjusted at its mid=
dle by the yokestrap=20

to the pole. But when their strength is not the same, and the stronger outd=
oes the other, the strap=20

is shifted so as to make one side of the yoke longer, which helps the weake=
r ox. Thus, in the case=20

of both poles and yokes, when the straps are not fastened at the middle, bu=
t at one side, the=20

farther the strap moves from the service, and whom it would be painful to t=
urn away.  "In the first=20

years I was elected here an honourary justice of the peace. I used to have =
to go to the town and=20

take part in the sessions of the congress and of the circuit court, and thi=
s was a pleasant change=20

for me. When you live here for two or three months without a break, especia=
lly in the winter, you=20

begin at last to pine for a black coat. And in the circuit court there were=
 frock-coats, and uniforms,=20

and dress-coats, too, all lawyers, men who have received a general educatio=
n; I had some one to=20

talk to. After sleeping in the sledge and dining in the kitchen, to sit in =
an arm-chair in clean linen, in=20

thin boots, with a chain on one's waistcoat, is such luxury!  "I received a=
 warm welcome in the=20

town. I made friends eagerly. And of all my acquaintanceships the most inti=
mate and, to tell the=20

truth, the most agreeable to me was my acquaintance with Luganovitch, the v=
ice-president of the=20

circuit court. You both know him: a most charming personality. It all happe=
ned just after a=20

celebrated case of incendiarism; the preliminary investigation lasted two d=
ays; we were=20

exhausted. Luganovitch looked at me and said:  "'Look here, come round to d=
inner with me.'  "This=20

was unexpected, as I knew Luganovitch very little, only officially, and I h=
ad never been to his=20

house. I only just went to my hotel room to change and went off to dinner. =
And here it was my lot=20

to meet Anna Alexyevna, Luganovitch's wife. At that time she was still very=
 young, not more than=20

twenty-two, and her first baby had been born just six months before. It is =
all a thing of the past;=20

and now I should find it difficult to define what there was so exceptional =
in her, what it was in her=20

attracted me so much; at the time, at dinner, it was all perfectly clear to=
 me. I saw a lovely young,=20

good, intelligent, fascinating woman, such as I had never met=20


_
other. So, if both ends are carried round in circles, using as a centre the=
 point to which the strap=20

has been brought, the longer end will describe a larger, and the shorter en=
d a smaller circle.  9.=20

Just as smaller wheels move harder and with greater difficulty than larger =
ones, so, in the case of=20

the poles and yokes, the parts where the interval from centre to end is les=
s, bear down hard upon=20

the neck, but where the distance from the same centre is greater, they ease=
 the burden both for=20

draught and carriage. As in all these cases motion is obtained by means of =
right lines at the centre=20

and by circles, so also farm waggons, travelling carriages, drums, mills, s=
crews, scorpiones,=20

ballistae, pressbeams, and all other machines, produce the results intended=
, on the same=20

principles, by turning about a rectilinear axis and by the revolution of a =
circle.     CHAPTER IV=20

ENGINES FOR RAISING WATER   1. I shall now explain the making of the differ=
ent kinds of=20

engines which have been invented for raising water, and will first speak of=
 the tympanum.=20

Although it does not lift the water high, it raises a great quantity very q=
uickly. An axle is fashioned=20

on a lathe or with the compasses, its ends are shod with iron hoops, and it=
 carries round its middle=20

a tympanum made of boards joined together. It rests on posts which have pie=
ces of iron on them=20

under the ends of the axle. In the interior of this tympanum there are eigh=
t crosspieces set at=20

intervals, extending from the axle to the circumference of the tympanum, an=
d dividing the space in=20

the tympanum into equal compartments.  2. Planks are nailed round the face =
of it, leaving six-inch=20

apertures to admit the water. At one side of it there are also holes, like =
those of a dovecot, next to=20

the axle, one for each compartment. After being smeared with pitch like a s=
hip, the thing is turned=20

by the tread of men, and raising the water by means of the apertures in the=
 face of the tympanum,=20

delivers it through the holes next to the axle into a wooden trough set und=
erneath, with a conduit=20

joined to it. Thus, a large quantity of water is furnished for irrigation i=
n gardens, or for supplying the=20

needs of saltworks.  3. But when it has to be raised higher, the same princ=
iple will be modified as=20

follows. A wheel on an axle is to be made, large enough to reach the necess=
ary height. All round=20

the circumference of the wheel there will be cubical boxes, made tight with=
 pitch and wax. So,=20

when the wheel is turned by treading, the boxes, carried up full and again =
returning to the bottom,=20

will of themselves discharge into the reservoir what they have carried up. =
 4. But, if it has to be=20

supplied to a place still more high, a double iron chain, which will reach =
the surface when let down,=20

is passed round the axle of the same wheel, with bronze buckets attached to=
 it, each holding=20

about six pints. The turning of the wheel, winding the chain round the axle=
, will carry the buckets to=20

the top, and as they pass above the axle they must tip over and deliver int=
o the reservoir what they=20

have carried up.     CHAPTER V  WATER WHEELS AND WATER MILLS   1. Wheels on=
 the=20

principles that have been described above are also constructed in rivers. R=
ound their faces=20

floatboards are fixed, which, on being struck by the current of the river, =
make the wheel turn as=20

they move, and thus, by raising the water in the boxes and bringing it to t=
he top, they accomplish=20

the necessary work through being turned by the mere impulse of the river, w=
ithout any treading on=20

the part of workmen.  2. Water mills are turned on the same principle. Ever=
ything is the same in=20

them, except that a drum with teeth is fixed into one end of the axle. It i=
s set vertically on its edge,=20

and turns in the same plane with the wheel. Next to this larger drum there =
is a smaller one, also=20

with teeth, but set horizontally, and this is attached (to the millstone). =
Thus the teeth of the drum=20

which is fixed to the axle make the teeth of the horizontal drum move, and =
cause the mill to turn. A=20

hopper, hanging over this contrivance, supplies the mill with corn, and mea=
l is produced by the=20



same revolution.     CHAPTER VI  THE WATER SCREW   1. There is also the met=
hod of the=20

screw, which raises a great quantity of water, but does not carry it as hig=
h as does the wheel. The=20

method of constructing it is as follows. A beam is selected, the thickness =
of which in digits is=20

equivalent to its length in feet. once some one close and already familiar,=
 as though that face,=20

those cordial, intelligent eyes, I had seen somewhere in my childhood, in t=
he album which lay on=20

my mother's chest of drawers.  "Four Jews were charged with being incendiar=
ies, were regarded=20

as a gang of robbers, and, to my mind, quite groundlessly. At dinner I was =
very much excited, I=20

was uncomfortable, and I don't know what I said, but Anna Alexyevna kept sh=
aking her head and=20

saying to her husband:  "'Dmitry, how is this?'  "Luganovitch is a good-nat=
ured man, one of those=20

simple-hearted people who firmly maintain the opinion that once a man is ch=
arged before a court=20

he is guilty, and to express doubt of the correctness of a sentence cannot =
be done except in legal=20

form on paper, and not at dinner and in private conversation.  "'You and I =
did not set fire to the=20

place,' he said softly, 'and you see we are not condemned, and not in priso=
n.'  "And both husband=20

and wife tried to make me eat and drink as much as possible. From some trif=
ling details, from the=20

way they made the coffee together, for instance, and from the way they unde=
rstood each other at=20

half a word, I could gather that they lived in harmony and comfort, and tha=
t they were glad of a=20

visitor. After dinner they played a duet on the piano; then it got dark, an=
d I went home. That was at=20

the beginning of spring.  "After that I spent the whole summer at Sofino wi=
thout a break, and I had=20

no time to think of the town, either, but the memory of the graceful fair-h=
aired woman remained in=20

my mind all those days; I did not think of her, but it was as though her li=
ght shadow were lying on=20

my heart.  "In the late autumn there was a theatrical performance for some =
charitable object in the=20

town. I went into the governor's box (I was invited to go there in the inte=
rval); I looked, and there=20

was Anna Alexyevna sitting beside the governor's wife; and again the same i=
rresistible, thrilling=20

impression of beauty and sweet, caressing eyes, and again the same feeling =
of nearness. We sat=20

side by side, then went to the foyer.  "'You've grown thinner,' she said; '=
have you been ill?'  "'Yes,=20

I've had rheumatism in my shoulder, and in rainy weather I can't sleep.'  "=
'You look dispirited. In=20

the spring, when you came to dinner, you were younger, more confident. You =
were full of=20

eagerness, and talked a great deal then; you were very interesting, and I r=
eally must confess I was=20

a little carried away by you. For some reason you often came back to my mem=
ory during the=20

summer, and when I was getting ready for the theatre today I thought I shou=
ld see you.'  "And she=20

laughed.  "'But you look dispirited today,' she repeated; 'it makes you see=
m older.'  "The next day I=20

lunched at the Luganovitchs'. After lunch they drove out to their summer vi=
lla, in order to make=20

arrangements there for the winter, and I went with them. I returned with th=
em to the town, and at=20

midnight drank tea with them in quiet domestic surroundings, while the fire=
 glowed, and the young=20

mother kept going to see if her baby girl was asleep. And after that, every=
 time I went to town I=20

never failed to visit the Luganovitchs. They grew used to me, and I grew us=
ed to them. As a rule I=20

went in unannounced, as though I were one of the family.  "'Who is there?' =
I would hear from a=20

faraway room, in the drawling voice that seemed to me so lovely.  "'It is P=
avel Konstantinovitch,'=20

answered the maid or the nurse.  "Anna Alexyevna would come out to me with =
an anxious face,=20

and would ask every time:  "'Why is it so long since you have been? Has any=
thing happened?'=20

"Her eyes, the elegant refined hand she gave me, her indoor dress, the way =
she did her hair, her=20

voice, her step, always produced the same impression on me of something new=
 and extraordinary=20



in my life, and very important. We talked together for hours, were silent, =
thinking each our own=20

thoughts, or she played for hours to me on the piano. If there were no one =
at home I stayed and=20

waited, talked to the nurse, played with the child, or lay on the sofa in t=
he study and read; and=20

when Anna Alexyevna came back I met her in the hall, took all her parcels f=
rom her, and for some=20

reason I carried those parcels every time with as much love, with as much s=
olemnity, as a boy.=20

"There is a proverb that if a peasant woman has no troubles she will buy a =
pig. The Luganovitchs=20

had no troubles, so they made friends with me. If I did not come to the tow=
n I must be=20


_
perfectly round. The ends are to be divided off on their circumference with=
 the compass into eight=20

parts, by quadrants and octants, and let the lines be so placed that, if th=
e beam is laid in a=20

horizontal position, the lines on the two ends may perfectly correspond wit=
h each other, and=20

intervals of the size of one eighth part of the circumference of the beam m=
ay be laid off on the=20

length of it. Then, placing the beam in a horizontal position, let perfectl=
y straight lines be drawn=20

from one end to the other. So the intervals will be equal in the directions=
 both of the periphery and=20

of the length. Where the lines are drawn along the length, the cutting circ=
les will make=20

intersections, and definite points at the intersections.  [Illustration: CO=
NSTRUCTION OF THE=20

WATER SCREW]  [Illustration: THE WATER SCREW  (From the edition of Vitruviu=
s by Fra=20

slender withe of=20
