them that they could not get out.  Fortunately there was a small door at th=
e other end of the barn,=20

and by this they all got out and made their way speedily across the clearin=
g to the house--Long=20

Jerry leading the way. Tom and Bob realized that they might easily have bec=
ome lost in that short=20

distance had they been left to their own resources.  Mr. Cameron was very p=
ale and his lips=20

trembled when he stood before the three woodsmen in the lodge kitchen.  "Yo=
u mean that to try to=20

seek for the girls now is impossible, Jerry?" he asked.  "What do you think=
 about it yourself, sir?"=20

returned the guide. "You have been out in it."  "I--I don't expect you to a=
ttempt what I cannot do=20

myself--"  "If mortal man could live in it, we'd make the attempt without y=
e, sir," declared Long=20

Jerry, warmly. "But neither dogs nor men could find their way in this smoth=
er It looks like it had set=20

in for a big blizzard. You don't know jest what that means up here in the b=
ackwoods. Logging=20

camps will be snowed under and mules, horses and oxen will have to be shot =
to save them from=20

starvation. The hunting will be mighty poor next fall, for the deer and oth=
er varmints will starve to=20

death, too.  "If poor people in the woods don't starve after this storm, it=
 will be lucky. Why, the last=20

big one we had the Octohac Company had a gang of fifty men shoveling out a =
road for twenty=20

miles so as to get tote teams through with provisions for their camp. And t=
hen men had to drag the=20

tote teams instead of horses, the critters were so near starved. Ain't that=
 so, Ben?"  "Surest thing=20

you know," agreed one of the other hands. "I remember that time well. I was=
 working for the=20

Goodwin & Manse Company. There was nigh a hundred of us on snow-shoes that =
dragged fodder=20

from the farmers along Rolling River to feed our stock on, and we didn't ge=
t out enough logs that=20

winter to pay the company for keeping the camp forward, striking his foot v=
iolently against the=20

bench in front of him. The sheriff looked up angrily at the noise. There is=
 something in a great=20

mental struggle of any kind which moves the atmosphere around it. The sheri=
ff looked up and saw=20

three men standing at unequal distances before him: Mr Monypenny in front o=
f his chair with=20

somebody tranquil and insignificant beside him, and in the distance a face =
full of extraordinary=20

emotion. "Will you have the goodness to step forward?" the sheriff said: an=
d then stopping himself=20

peevishly, "This is all out of order. Produce the man."  Rolls had risen qu=
ietly by Mr Monypenny's=20

side. He was not like a brawler, much less an assassin. He was somewhat pal=
e, but in his=20

professional black coat and white tie, who could have looked more respectab=
le? He had "cleaned=20

himself," as he said, with great care that morning. Haggard and unshaven as=
 he had been on the=20

previous night after his wanderings, he would scarcely have made so great a=
 sensation as he did=20

now, trim as a new pin, carefully shaved, carefully brushed. There was a ha=
lf shout, half cry, from=20

the little band of spectators, now thoroughly demoralised and incapable of =
keeping order. "Rolls,=20

old Rolls!" John Erskine cried with consternation. Could this be the explan=
ation of it? As for Rolls=20

himself, the outcry acted upon him in the most remarkable way. He grew red =
and lost his temper.=20

"It's just me, gentlemen," he said; "and can an accident not happen to a ma=
n in a humble condition=20

of life as well as to one of you?" He was silenced at once, and the stir of=
 amazement repressed;=20

but nothing could prevent the rustle and whisper among the gentlemen, which=
 would have become=20

tumultuous had their presence there been more than tolerated. They all knew=
 Rolls, and to=20

connect him with such an event was impossible. The tragedy seemed over, and=
 at the utmost a=20

tragi-comedy, a solemn=20

"That's the way on it, Mr. Cameron," said Long Jerry. "We got to sit down a=
nd wait for a hold-up.=20

Nothing else to do. You kin try telephoning up and down the line to see if =
the girls changed their=20

route and got to any house."  But when Mr. Cameron tried to use the 'phone =
he found that already=20

there was a break somewhere on the line. He could get no reply.  They were =
besieged by the=20

Storm King, and he proved to be a most pitiless enemy. The drifting snow ro=
se higher and higher=20

about the lodge every hour. The day dragged on its weary length into night,=
 and still the wind blew=20

and the snow sifted down, until even the top panes of the first floor windo=
ws were buried beneath=20

the white mantle.     CHAPTER XX  THE SNOW SHROUD   It was rather difficult=
 to find trees with=20

the new and fragrant leaves started, at this time of year; therefore Ruth a=
nd her companions went=20

rather farther from Snow Camp than they had at first intended. But the warn=
ing flakes had taken its=20

place.  Rolls's statement, however, was serious enough. It was to the effec=
t that he had met his=20

master coming down from Tinto in the condition of which so much had been ma=
de, when he=20

himself was going up to make a request to Mr Torrance about a lease--that h=
e met Torrance close=20

to the Scaur "coming thundering down the brae" in a state of excitement and=
 temper such as it=20

was well enough known Tinto was subject to. Rolls acknowledged that in such=
 circumstances he=20

ought not to have stopped him and introduced his suit--but this was merely =
an error of judgment.=20

Tinto, he said, received his request very ill, and called his nephew--for w=
hom he was going to=20

plead--a ne'er-do-weel--which was not the case, let him say it that would. =
And here again Rolls=20

was wrong, he allowed--it was another error of judgment--but he was not goi=
ng to have his own=20

flesh and blood abused. He stood up for it to Tinto's face that Willie Roll=
s was as respectable a=20
