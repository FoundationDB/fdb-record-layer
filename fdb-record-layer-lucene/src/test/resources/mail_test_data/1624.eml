philodendron monstera  "As she's fond of him, and trusts him, probably she would have thought no such thing," I tried to comfort Maxine. "But certainly, it was a rather bad fix."  "Rather bad fix! Oh, you laconic creatures, Englishmen. All you think of is to hide your feelings behind icy words. As for me--well, philodendron monstera  "As she's fond of him, and trusts him, probably she would have thought no such thing," I tried to comfort Maxine. "But certainly, it was a rather bad fix."  "Rather bad fix! Oh, you laconic creatures, Englishmen. All you think of is to hide your feelings behind icy words. As for me--well, _
but no patching of mine can make the place fit for a human being to live in, let alone a rheumatic 

old woman. You know well the state of the cottages; something must be done for them without 

much delay, or the old hulks will soon fall to pieces."  Every symptom of a smile had disappeared 

from the hard face of Bat Bell as soon as his visitor had mentioned Wild Rose Hollow; and when 

Ned paused, the miller's only reply was a "humph," uttered in a very discouraging tone.  "Don't you 

think that it would be a shame and disgrace to Colme, if dwellings that have afforded shelter for 

two hundred and fifty years to the aged respectable poor of our village were all suffered to go to 

utter decay from neglect, as one of them already has done?"  "Why don't young Sir Lacy mend 

'em? He has money enough," said the miller, "and flings it away right and left, they say, in ways 

that are little to his credit."  "If he does not come forward, is his backwardness an example to be 

followed?" asked Franks.  "Let the clergy see to it; it's their business," said Bell, with a little 

disagreeable twitch of the nostril, which with him was always a sign that something was "putting 

him out."  "Mr. Leyton preached twice yesterday in aid of the work, but the collections made were 

wretched,--not one tenth of what is absolutely required."  "The parish overseers must do 

something."  "They refuse to stir a finger," said Franks; "they say it's no business of theirs."  "Then 

I'm sure that it's no business of mine," interrupted the miller.  "Is it no business of ours," said the 

school-master, earnestly, "that they whom we have known for years, they who have lived amongst 

us, and hoped to die amongst us, should be deprived of the comfort, the quiet, the independence 

which they so dearly prize?"  "I'm sorry for them," said the miller, carelessly; "the founder should 

have left something to keep the wheel going."  "What is wanted is the full stream of Christian love," 

observed Franks. "There are scores of charities in London kept constantly working by nothing but 

that stream."  The miller did not look as if he had a drop of such love within him. "It is clear," I'm 

afraid of him, since I've cared for Raoul, though I used to be afraid of no one, when I'd only myself 

to think of. Raoul was going away that very night. He had an errand to do for a woman who was a 

dear and intimate friend of his dead mother. You must know of the Duchesse de Montpellier? Well, 

it was for her: and Raoul is like her son. She has no children of her own."  "I don't know her," I 

said, "but I've seen her; a charming looking woman, about forty-five, with a gloomy-faced 

husband--a fellow who might be rather a Tartar to live with. They were pointed out to me at Monte 

Carlo one year, in the Casino, where the Duchess seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, though 

the Duke had the air of being dragged in against his will."  "No doubt he had been--or else he was 

there to fetch her out. Poor dear, she's a dreadful gambler. It's in her blood! I She lost, I don't know 

how much, at Monte Carlo on an 'infallible system' she had. She's afraid of her husband, though 

she loves him immensely; and lately a craze she's had for Bridge has cost her so much that she 

daren't tell the Duke, who hates her gambling. She confessed to Raoul, and begged him to help 

her--not with money, for he has none, but by taking a famous and wonderful diamond necklace of 

hers to Amsterdam, selling the stones for her there, and having them replaced with paste. It was 

all to be done very secretly, of course, so that the Duke shouldn't know, and Raoul hated it, but he 

couldn't refuse. He had no idea of telling me this story, that day when he 'lost his head,' while we 

were bidding each other good-bye before his journey. He didn't mention the name of the Duchess, 

but said only that he had leave, and was going to Holland on business. But while he was away a 

_dreadful_ thing happened--the most ghastly misfortune--and as we were engaged to be married, 

he felt obliged when he came back to let me know the worst."  "What was the dreadful thing that 



happened?" I asked, as she paused, pressing her hands against her temples.  "The necklace was 

stolen from Raoul by a thief, who must have been one of the most expert in the world. Can you 

imagine Raoul's 


_
me try him on that of conscience. Why," he continued, aloud, "there's no plainer command in the 

Bible than _To do good and to distribute, forget not; let us do good unto all men, and specially 

unto them that are of the household of faith_."  "I know something of the Bible, too," replied Bat 

Bell, coldly, and the twitch was more unpleasant than before. "I'm a father, and I don't forget that 

it's written that _He who provideth not for his own came to me in despair, asking my advice. What 

was he to do? He dared not appeal to the police, or the Duchess's secret would come out. And he 

couldn't bear to tell her of the loss, not only because it would be such a blow to her, as she was 

depending on the money from the sale of the jewels, but because she knew that he was in some 

difficulties, and _might_ be tempted to believe that he'd only pretended the diamonds were stolen-
