mouth of Little Rockey Creek on the River Northanna south, twenty degrees w=
est until it intersects=20

the line of Goochland County" should become a distinct county and known by =
the name of Louisa=20

County. The name honored a daughter of George II, as Amelia had done a few =
years earlier.  Two=20

years later the first of the eight counties eventually cut from Goochland w=
as created and given the=20

name Albemarle. This was in honor of William Anne Keppel, second Earl of Al=
bemarle, Governor-

General of the Colony, 1737-1754. Like most of the Governors-General, he di=
d not come to=20

Virginia, but the Lieutenant Governor as his deputy, performed the duties o=
f his office.  The=20

bounds of Albemarle were to be divided from Goochland on the west "by a lin=
e run from the point=20

of fork of James River north, thirty degrees east to the Louisa County line=
, and from the said point=20

of fork a direct course to Brooks mill and from thence the same course cont=
inued to Appomattox=20

River." "The point of fork" is the junction of the Rivanna with the James. =
It will be noted by the=20

reference to the Appomattox River that Albemarle extended across James Rive=
r just as=20

Goochland did. "Monticello" the beloved home of Thomas Jefferson, is in Alb=
emarle County, and=20

in architecture and planning is another example of the amazing versatility =
of his genius.  In 1746,=20

the settlements in Brunswick County had grown to such an extent that a new =
division was=20

required. The line was ordered "to be run from the county line where it cro=
sses Roanoke River=20

below the place called the Horse Ford to strike Nottoway River at the south=
." The territory above=20

this line was to be called Lunenburg County. This title, anglicized from th=
e German form,=20

Luneburg, was chosen since the are persons distinguished for their capacity=
 and attainments, and=20

notwithstanding the local feelings nourished by our state sovereignties, an=
d the rival claims of=20

several of our larger cities, there is evidently a predisposition towards a=
 concentration of effort,=20

from which we may hope for the happiest results, with regard to the advance=
ment of both the=20

science and the reputation of our country.  Is it not, therefore, desirable=
 to furnish some rallying=20

point, some object sufficiently interesting to be compassed by common effor=
ts, and thus to=20

become the basis of an enduring, common interest? To produce these efforts,=
 and to excite this=20

interest, nothing, perhaps, bids fairer than a SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL. Hitherto=
 nearly all our=20

exertions, of this kind, have been made by medical gentlemen, and directed =
primarily to medical=20

objects. We are neither ignorant nor forgetful of the merits of our various=
 MEDICAL JOURNALS,=20

nor of the zeal with which, as far as consistent with their main object, th=
ey have fostered the=20

physical sciences. We are aware, also, that Journals have been established,=
 _professedly_=20

deriving their materials principally from foreign sources; that our various=
 literary Magazines and=20

Reviews have given, and continue to give, some notices of physical and math=
ematical subjects,=20

and that some of them seem even partial to these branches of knowledge: tha=
t various limited=20

efforts have been made, and are still making, to publish occasional or peri=
odical papers, devoted=20

to mathematical or physical subjects, and that even our newspapers sometime=
s contain scientific=20

intelligence. We are aware, also, that some of our academies and societies =
of natural history,=20

either in Journals of their own, or through the=20

Luneburg, like that of Brunswick, belonged to the Electorate of Hanover. Lu=
nenburg embraced a=20

vast acreage stretching from the rolling country where bright tobacco came =
to perfection as far=20

west as the mountains and on the south to the North Carolina boundary.   CU=
MBERLAND,=20

CULPEPER, SOUTHAMPTON AND CHESTERFIELD CREATED, 1749  The western portion o=
f=20

Goochland lying on both sides of the James had, in 1744, been taken to form=
 the new county of=20

Albemarle; now, five years later, the southeast portion of Goochland was ma=
de into the new=20

county of Cumberland. The name was further honor for the Duke of Cumberland=
, "The Butcher of=20

Culloden." The growth in this locality had been hastened by the arrival of =
numerous Huguenot=20

families seeking asylum from persecution in France. Manakintown was the nam=
e of their=20

settlement. The name is perpetuated in a newly erected Episcopal church not=
 far from the site of=20

the settlement where the Agee, Fourqurean, Legrand, Michaux, Guerrant, Flou=
rnoy and other=20

families worship now, as they have done for some 250 years.  In the same ye=
ar that Cumberland=20

was formed, a new county was taken from Orange and named Culpeper, presumab=
ly in honor of=20

Lord Culpeper, Governor of Virginia 1680-1683, a compliment to Lord Fairfax=
 "who had inherited=20

from him the ownership of the Northern Neck." Culpeper lay on the south sid=
e of the=20

Rappahannock and north of the Conway River commonly called the fork of the =
Rappahannock=20

River. The fork of the Rappahannock was the area between the Rappahannock R=
iver and its=20

tributary, the Conway, now called the Rapidan. "Horseshoe Farm" is in Culpe=
per County and takes=20

its name from the bend or horseshoe made by the Rapidan within which it is =
situated. While the=20

residence is modern, the farm is of colonial times and was once to the publ=
ic the efforts of their=20

members in various branches of natural science.  But all these facts go onl=
y to prove the strong=20

tendency which exists in this country towards the cultivation of physical s=
cience, and the=20

inadequacy of the existing means for its effectual promulgation.  Although =
our limits do not permit=20

us, however much inclined, to be more particular in commemorating the labou=
rs and in honouring=20

the performances (often marked by much ability) of our predecessors and cot=
emporaries, there is=20

one effort which we are not willing to pass by without a more particular no=
tice; and we are=20

persuaded that no apology is necessary for naming the Journal of the late D=
r. Bruce, of New-York,=20

devoted principally to mineralogy and geology.  No future historian of Amer=
ican science will fail to=20

commemorate this work as our earliest _purely scientific_ Journal, supporte=
d by _original=20

American communications_.  Both in this country and in Europe, it was recei=
ved in a very flattering=20

manner; it excited, _at home_, great zeal and effort in support of the scie=
nces which it fostered,=20

and, _abroad_, it was hailed as the harbinger of our future exertions. The =
editor was honoured=20

with letters on the subject of his Journal, and with applications for it fr=
om most of the countries in=20

Europe; but its friends had to regret that, although conducted in a manner =
perfectly to their=20

satisfaction, it appeared only at distant intervals, and, after the lapse o=
f several years, never=20

proceeded beyond the fourth number.  The hopes of its revival have now, unh=
appily, become=20

completely extinct, by the lamented death of Dr. Bruce.[1]  This gentleman,=
 with an accomplished=20

education, with extensive acquirements in science, and great zeal for promo=
ting it in his own=20

country; advantageously and=20


_
It was from this house that, in 1741, he went to Annapolis, Maryland expect=
ing to sail with an=20

expedition to join Admiral Vernon and attack Cartagena in the Spanish Main.=
 He died=20

unexpectedly in Annapolis but, strangely enough, considering his prominence=
, his burial place is=20

unknown.  Besides Culpeper and Cumberland, a third county, Southampton, was=
 formed in 1749.=20

This was taken from that portion of Isle of Wight's territory that lay west=
 of Blackwater River. The=20

name is said to honor, tho belatedly, Henry Wriothesley, second Earl of Sou=
thampton, friend of=20

Shakespeare and a leading furnished with a correct and discriminating mind,=
 and a chaste,=20

scientific taste, was so well qualified for the task which he had undertake=
n, that no one can=20

attempt to resume those scientific labours which he has now _for ever_ reli=
nquished, without=20

realizing that he undertakes an arduous enterprise, and lays himself under =
a heavy responsibility.=20

American science has much to lament in the death of Dr. Bruce.  No one, it =
is presumed, will doubt=20

that a Journal devoted to science, and embracing a sphere sufficiently exte=
nsive to allure to its=20

support the principal scientific men of our=20


_
City of Hampton and Hampton River honor the same person. Southampton is one=
 of the cotton-

raising counties of Virginia, and in the fall the fields of cotton are a be=
autiful sight.  Still a fourth=20

county was formed in 1749 and that was Chesterfield. This, as was the case =
with the other three,=20

represented no great expansion, but was in line with the thesis long before=
 laid greatly needed; if=20

cordially supported, it will be successful, and if successful, it will be a=
 great public benefit.  Even a=20

failure, in so good a cause, (unless it should arise from incapacity or unf=
aithfulness,) cannot be=20

regarded as dishonourable. It may prove only that the attempt was _prematur=
e_, and that our=20

country is not yet ripe for such an undertaking; for=20
