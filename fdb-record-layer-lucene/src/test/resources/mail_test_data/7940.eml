dracaena marginata licentiate's expense to the island of Cuba from whence he brought her. Ortiz also appealed from this decision.  As I asked that she might now be given the letter and order of Your Highness permitting her to return with this fleet, Ortiz presented a statement showing that his dracaena marginata licentiate's expense to the island of Cuba from whence he brought her. Ortiz also appealed from this decision.  As I asked that she might now be given the letter and order of Your Highness permitting her to return with this fleet, Ortiz presented a statement showing that his _
officials such as the treasurer, accountant, and agents, who seem to me to be those I have 

mentioned above, and some few minor officials, I see there is little zeal or kindness for the Indians, 

and I observe such disinclination to accomplish anything in their favour, that however small may 

be the pendulum, they work it with as much effort as though it were a tower they had to move. 

Truly I think Your Highness must order everything to be done gratis and willingly;--or if not, then 

pay somebody who will do it.  There is very great need here for somebody to help these poor 

Indians, being as they are, in great want and more than miserable, because they do not know how 

to ask for justice. They have been so intimidated and thrust down into the very abyss that they 

dare not complain.  I do not find a single man who will take pity on them: but on the contrary, every 

on persecutes, terrorizes, and despises them.  And I am sure God will execute justice and exact 

vengeance for all this.  It would be well if Your Highness would order a salary to be paid some 

man who time away, and when I saw him again he had courted the daughter of some rich and 

noble house.  I was handsome enough still, but he never looked at me at the banquets.  I came 

across him at least twenty times, but he avoided me as if I were tainted with leprosy, and I began 

to fret, and fell ill of a fever.  The doctors said it was all over with me, so I sent him a letter in which 

there was nothing but these words: 'Beki is dying, and would like to see Assa once more,' and in 

the papyrus I put his first present--a plain ring.  And what was the answer?  a handful of gold! 

Gold--gold!  Thou may'st believe me, when I say that the sight of it was more torturing to my eyes 

than the iron with which they put out the eyes of criminals.  Even now, when I think of it--But what 

do you men, you lords of rank and wealth, know of a breaking heart?  When two or three of you 

happen to meet, and if thou should'st tell the story, the most respectable will say in a pompous 

voice: 'The man acted nobly indeed; he was married, and his wife would have complained with 

justice if he

House, commanding all necessary authority to be attached to his office, and that the officials 

should help him in it.  If it is necessary to consult His Majesty for this, do not let these poor 

wretches suffer for want of protection as they have always done.  There is a porter in this House, a 

good man who, according to what I have seen and the officials told me, has repeatedly taken pity 

on them, and I beseech Your Highness to grant me and all the Indians the favour of gone to see 

the singer.'  Am I right or wrong?  I know; not one will remember that the other was a woman, a 

feeling human being; it will occur to no one that his deed on the one hand saved an hour of 

discomfort, and on the other wrought half a century of despair.  Assa escaped his wife's scolding, 

but a thousand curses have fallen on him and on his house.  How virtuous he felt himself when he 

had crushed and poisoned a passionate heart that had never ceased to love him!  Ay,

protector of all the Indians in this Kingdom and of their affairs in this House, authorising him to 

report all the happenings of any importance to Your Highness and to the Royal Council of the 

Indies.  Let this power be given to Diego Collantes, porter of the said House; and to ensure his 

using it the more faithfully until Your Highness pleases he had not still felt some love for me, if he 

had not misdoubted himself, and feared that the dying woman might once more light up the fire he 

had so carefully smothered and crushed out.  I would have grieved for him-- but that he should 

send me money, money!--that I have never forgiven; that he shall atone for in his grandchild."  The

salary, I will pay him twenty ducats yearly, so that he may do his duty in the said office.  The truth 

is, that although he is a good man, the position needs a man with much more authority but for the 

present he would suffice.  Juan de la Quadra, who was secretary to the licentiate Gregorio Lopez 

while he was here, spoke to me about these matters.  He seems to me an honest, upright person 

and one who feels deeply the crimes committed in this city against the words as if in a dream, and 

without seeming to remember her hearer.  Ani shuddered, as if he were in the presence of a mad 

woman, and he involuntarily drew his chair back a little way.  The witch observed this; she took 

breath and went on: "You lords, who walk in high places, do not know how things go on in the 

depths beneath you; you do not choose to know.  "But I will shorten my story.  I got well, but I got 

out of my bed thin and voiceless.  I had plenty of

subject and I beseech Your Highness to order some remedy provided for the actual necessities. 

He informs me that he is writing in the sense of what I said above.  The licentiate Bartolome Ortiz 

did not bring his Indians to be registered within the period intimated to him and says that he 

protested against the sentence before this Royal Council, also with regard to other Indians whom 

he held as slaves, despite the fact that they were free.  Amongst these was an Indian woman who 

was beyond question free, and had been declared free by Gregorio everyone who professed 

magic in Thebes, potions to recover Assa's love for me, or in paying for spells to be cast on him, 

or for magic drinks to destroy him.  I tried too to recover my voice, but the medicines I took for it 

made it rougher not sweeter.  Then an excommunicated priest, who was famous among the 

magicians, took me into his house, and there I learned many things; his old companions 

afterwards turned upon him, he came over here into the Necropolis, and I came with him.  When 

at last he was taken and hanged, I remained in his cave,
