There is no helpful bibliography on the early education of the American Neg=
ro. A few books=20

treating the recent problems of education in this country give facts about =
the enlightenment of the=20

colored people before their general emancipation, but the investigator has =
to depend on=20

promiscuous sources for adequate information of this kind. With the excepti=
on of a survey of the=20

_Legal Status of the Colored Population in Respect to Schools and Education=
 in the Different=20

States_, published in the Report of the United States Commissioner of Educa=
tion in 1871, there=20

has been no attempt at a general treatment of this phase of our history. Th=
is treatise, however, is=20

too brief to inculcate an appreciation of the extensive efforts to enlighte=
n the ante-bellum Negro.=20

Considered as a local problem this question has received more attention. A =
few writers have=20

undertaken to sketch the movement to educate the colored people of certain =
communities before=20

the Civil War. Their objective point, however, has been rather to treat of =
later periods. The books=20

mentioned below give some information with respect to the period treated in=
 this monograph.=20

excellency in a very bad humour. The destruction of the Kremlin was perhaps=
 enough to account=20

for this; but there may have been in addition an altercation with Marshal K=
utusov--not a very rare=20

occurrence, for between the general-in-chief of the army and the governor o=
f Moscow there was=20

no friendship. Ivan found the count surrounded by the members of his suite,=
 to whom he was=20

giving directions in preparation for an immediate return to the city.  =E2=
=80=9CDo you come with us, Ivan=20

Ivanovitch?=E2=80=9D he asked abruptly, and of course in Russian, the only =
language he would tolerate in=20

his presence, although he himself spoke and wrote French with elegance and =
precision.  Ivan=20

saluted him with due respect, but answered in the negative.  =E2=80=9CAh! t=
hen I shall have the trouble of=20

speaking to the marshal about you,=E2=80=9D returned the count, with an air=
 of annoyance, at which Ivan=20

was scarcely surprised, for Rostopchine=E2=80=99s manner on the preceding e=
vening had made him fully=20

aware that he desired to retain him in his own service. So he answered defe=
rentially, =E2=80=9CInstead of=20

imposing that trouble upon your excellency, I shall avail myself of the thi=
rd proposal you did me the=20

honour to make, and very humbly entreat of you to intrust me with despatche=
s for his Imperial=20

Majesty.=E2=80=9D  Ivan was utterly amazed at the count=E2=80=99s reception=
 of this request. =E2=80=9CThen you are as great=20

a fool as I took you for the first day I saw your face. And,=E2=80=9D added=
 Rostopchine, with one of his=20

resounding Russian oaths, =E2=80=9Cyou could not possibly be a greater!=E2=
=80=9D  Such an address from such a=20

personage, and in the presence of a score of witnesses, might well have dis=
concerted an older=20

man than Ivan, especially as he could not in the least imagine the cause of=
 it. But to every one=E2=80=99s=20

astonishment he stood his ground, and answered with the utmost coolness and=
 self-possession,=20
