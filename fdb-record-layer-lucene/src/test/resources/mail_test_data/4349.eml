and of the troops in=20

ultimate destination. There he was to occupy a convenient point =E2=80=9Con=
 or near the Rio Grande,=E2=80=9D but=20

composition but differing in tone, the son's copy having apparently been le=
ft in an unfinished=20

condition with the brown underpainting visible throughout. That this, and n=

is the original of the picture in Steven's _L'Atelier_ is clear at the firs=
t glance, the warm tonality=20

having been accurately reproduced and into Texas, and in August he establis=

considered as =E2=80=9Cnear=E2=80=9D the Rio Grande, being, in fact, about =
one hundred and fifty miles therefrom.=20

obtained here and reported to Washington indicated no threatening movement =
on the part of the=20

Mexicans; but on October 4th he suggested that, if the United States govern=

on the Rio Grande as the boundary, it would gain an advantage by=20


_
conscience, in a word, that Stevens demonstrates his descent from the great=
 line of Flemish=20

painters and makes good their tradition in modern life. Many of his sayings=
 are expressive of his=20

personal attitude toward art. For example:  "It is first of all necessary t=
o be a painter. No one is=20

wholly an artist who is not a perfect workman."  "When your right hand beco=
mes too facile--more=20

facile than the thought that guides it, use the left hand."  "Do not put in=
to a picture too many things=20

which attract attention. When every one speaks at once no one is heard."  C=
oncerning technique,=20

he says to his pupils: "Paint quantities of flowers. It is excellent practi=
ce. Use the palette knife to=20

unite and smooth the color, efface with the knife the traces of the brush. =
When one paints with a=20

brush the touches seen through a magnifying glass are streaked with light a=
nd shade because of=20

the hairs of the brush. The use of the palette knife renders these strokes =
as smooth as marble, the=20

shadows have disappeared. The material brought together renders the tone mo=
re beautiful.=20

Marble has never an ugly tone."  "One may use impasto, but not everywhere. =
Your brush should=20

be handled with reference to the character of what you are copying ... do n=
ot forget that an apple=20

is smooth. I should like to see you model a billiard ball. Train yourself t=
o have a true eye."  These=20

are precepts that might be given by any good painter, but few of the modern=
s could more justly=20

claim to have points on that river. He therefore suggested an advance to Po=
int Isabel and=20

Laredo.[110] Meanwhile had come the attempt to renew diplomatic relations b=
etween the United=20

States and Mexico, which ended in failure. January 13, 1846, when it was kn=
own in Washington=20

that Slidell would probably not be received by the Mexican government, Tayl=
or was ordered to=20

advance to the Rio Grande.[111]  Up to the time of this movement the Mexica=
n government had=20

neglected the distinction in the validity of its claims to the territory ea=
st of the Rio Grande. It=20

strenuously asserted the right of Mexico to the whole of Texas, whatever it=
s limits might be, and=20

declared that annexation would be tantamount to a declaration of war. From =
the Mexican point of=20

view, Taylor invaded Mexico the moment he entered Texas. But when he advanc=
ed to the Rio=20

Grande the distinction was finally made. April 12, 1846, he was warned by A=
mpudia, general in=20

command of the Mexican forces at Matamoras, to retire in twenty-four hours-=
-not beyond the=20

Sabine, as one might have expected from the previous attitude of the Mexica=
n government, but=20

beyond the Nueces.[112]  A few days later occurred the first conflict. Apri=
l 24th a party of dragoons=20

sent out by Taylor was ambushed on the east side of the river by a large fo=
rce of Mexicans, and=20

after a skirmish, in which a number of men were killed and wounded, was cap=
tured.[113] The=20

official report of this affair reached Washington the evening of Saturday, =
May=20


_
preached.  As a creative artist Stevens had his limitations. His lineal arr=
angements are seldom=20

entirely fortunate and his compositions, despite the skill with which the g=
iven space is filled, lack=20

except in rare instances the serenity of less crowded canvasses. He invaria=
bly strove to gain=20

atmosphere by his choice and 9th.[114] President Polk had already decided, =
in conformity with the=20

judgment of all his cabinet except Bancroft, to send to Congress a message =
recommending a=20

declaration of war. Now, in formulating the reasons for the declaration, he=
 asserted that =E2=80=9CMexico=20

has passed the boundary of the United States, has invaded our territory,=20
