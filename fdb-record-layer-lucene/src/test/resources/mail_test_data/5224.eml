telephone summons was part of a plan to entice him away from the school, but, of course, there 

was a possibility that an accident had occurred and that even now Daniel Holbrook was hovering 

between life and death, and wondering why Teeny-bits did not come to him. There was still 

another thought: circumstances had cast about him a cloud of suspicion which was evident to two 

persons whose respect he wished to retain,--Doctor Wells and Mr. Stevens. What would their 

feeling toward him be when they learned that he had disappeared from the school without saying a 

word to any one? They could arrive at only one conclusion: that he was guilty of stealing from his 

schoolmates and that, fearing to face the charges against him, he had run away like a coward. If 

the worst should happen--if he should not come out alive from the predicament in which he now 

found himself--his name would be remembered forever as that of one who had neither honor nor 

courage.  Those thoughts seemed to Teeny-bits more than he could bear, and suddenly a feeling 

of bitter rage welled up within him against the unknown enemy who had caused him all this 

misery. He could not believe that Snubby Turner had anything to do with it. The only persons in 

Ridgley School whom he had reason to suspect were Bassett and Tracey Campbell. He made up 

his mind that if he ever escaped from his present predicament he would go straight to those two 

members of Ridgley School and ask them point-blank if they were at the bottom of his troubles. If 

they could not come forth with an answer that rang true, he would give them both a thrashing that 

they would never forget. He would welcome a chance to meet them singly or as a pair. He began 

to struggle at his bonds and was soon dripping with perspiration from his efforts. After a time he 

saw the uselessness of it and, almost exhausted, lay breathing deeply the close atmosphere of the 

room.  The night before the "big game" at Ridgley School resembled the lull before a storm; word 

had been passed as usual that the dormitories were to be quiet and members of the on towards 

the adjoining hills of Salisbury Craig and Arthur's Seat, passing under the greenstone and trap tuff. 

The bituminous shale presents the usual characters; intermixed with it are numerous nodules of 

the common clay ironstone, the colour of which is a yellowish brown, these also frequently present 

characters common to the three substances, and throughout the beds, the passage from the one 

to the other is distinct. Whatever may be the opinions in regard to the origin of bituminous shale, 

there can be but one in regard to that of sandstone; and this has lately received no feeble support 

from the account given us by Dr. Paris, of a formation of this rock on the coast of Cornwall, where, 

says he, "we actually detect nature at work, and she does not refuse admittance into her 

manufactory, nor conceal, with her accustomed reserve, the details of the operations in which she 

is engaged."  From the appearances which have been thus briefly noticed, no impartial geologist, 

we should imagine, would infer the _volcanic_ origin of any portion of this formation; and if the 

aqueous origin of sandstone can be established, that of the wacke must be the same.         *       * 

*       *       *  From its intimate connexion with the preceding subject, Dr. Webster subjoins the 

following:    _Extract from a Paper on a recent formation of Sandstone,   occurring in various parts 

of the Northern coast of Cornwall_;   by JOHN AYSTON PARIS, M.D. F.L.S., &c. &c. Published in 

the   Transactions of the Geological Society of Cornwall, 1818.  "A very considerable portion of the 

northern coast of Cornwall, is covered with a calcareous sand, consisting of minute particles of 

comminuted shells. That part which lies between St. Ives and Padstow is more immediately the 

subject of the present inquiry; a tract which, with a few exceptions, is entirely covered with this 

species of sand; and which in some places, has accumulated in quantities so great as to have 



formed hills of from forty to sixty feet in elevation. A considerable area, for instance, in the 

parishes of 


_
of the football players, who, of course, needed, on this night of all nights, a sound and long sleep. 

In Lincoln Hall, at meal time, there had been a hum of eager conversation: the Jefferson team had 

arrived in Hamilton and had gone to comfortable quarters at Grey Stone Inn, three miles from the 

school. They would remain at the inn until just before the game, when they would come to the field 

in automobiles. Several of the Ridgleyites who had been in the station at the time of the visitors' 

arrival reported that the Jefferson players were "huskies" and that Norris, the renowned full-back, 

was the biggest "of the lot." The main body of Jefferson students would arrive by special train at 

noon on Saturday.  Many a member of Ridgley School on this eve of the great struggle was filled 

with a feeling of restlessness; it seemed that the minutes were dragging with indescribable 

slowness, that the night would never pass and that the hour would never come when the referee 

would blow his whistle to start the contest upon which the Ridgley hopes and fears were centered. 

Among those restless spirits who longed for some way to speed the minutes was Snubby Turner. 

He had gone down to the Hamilton Station and had come away not at all reassured by the sight 

that had met his eyes. The representatives of Jefferson School were a formidable looking lot, and 

it increased Snubby's peace of mind not at all to have had a close view of Norris' athletic form. He 

sensed a feeling of overflowing confidence in these big sons of Jefferson, and he longed to talk to 

some one who could dispel his doubts and drive away the insidious fears that were gnawing at 

what he called his "Ridgley spirit." In these circumstances he would have gone to Teeny-bits, or he 

might even have imposed upon the hospitality of Neil Durant,--if he had not known that loyalty to 

the school demanded that he should not bother any member of the eleven. He finally sought 

consolation by going down to the basement of Gannett Hall to pay a visit to old Jerry. He found the 

ancient janitor's assistant leaning back in a rickety chair reading by the light of an unshaded 

electric bulb. The old man put the volume down upon his knee and looked at Snubby with eyes 

that seemed to be gazing on distant scenes.  "What kind of book is that?" asked Snubby. "A 

novel?"  Old Jerry thrust his head forward slightly, as if seeing his visitor for the first time, and said: 

"There's _ijeers_ in this book, I wanter tell yer. It's about an awful smart feller who had ways of his 

own in gettin' at the bottom o' things--kind of a detecative chap."  Snubby looked at the title and 

saw that it was "The Mystery of the Million Dollar Diamond."  "It does a man good sometimes to 

exercise his brains on meesterious happenin's," said old Jerry, "and you know we got plenty o' 

reason to study up things o' that sort."  "Yes, we have; but I'm not half as much interested in that 

stuff just now as I am in the Jefferson game. Who do you think's going to win?"  Old Jerry laid the 

book carefully aside on his table, looked at his questioner seriously for a moment and said:  "I got 

my ijeers about that too, but it don't do no good to tell everythin' that is millin' aroun' in your head. 

Now I once heared of a feller who had a job forecastin' the weather for a noospaper, and he'd allus 

say right out _positive_ whether it 'ud rain or shine--it was allus goin' to be bright and clear or dark 

and stormy--and along come a spell o' and several churches have been inundated. In digging into 

these sand hills, or upon the occasional removal of some part of them by the winds, the remains of 

houses may be seen; and in some places, where the churchyards have been overwhelmed, a 

great number of human bones may be found. The sand is supposed to have been originally 

brought from the sea by hurricanes, probably at a remote period."----"The sand first appears in a 

slight but increasing state of aggregation on several parts of the shore in the bay of St. Ives; but on 

approaching the Gwythian river, it becomes more extensive and indurated. On the shore opposite 



to Godrevy Island, an immense mass of it occurs, of more than a hundred feet in length, and from 

twelve to twenty feet in depth, containing entire shells and fragments of clay slate; it is singular 

that the whole mass assumes a striking appearance of stratification. In some places it appears 

that attempts have been made to separate it, probably for the purpose of building; for several old 

houses in Gwythian are built of it."----"It is around the promontory of New Kaye that the most 

extensive formation of sandstone takes place. Here it may be seen in different stages of 

induration; from a state in which it is too friable to be detached from the rock upon which it 

reposes, to a hardness so considerable, that it requires a very violent blow from a sledge to break 

it."----"But it is on the western side of the promontory of New Kaye, in Fistril Bay, that the geologist 

will be most struck with the formation; for here no other rock is in sight. The cliffs, which are high, 

and extend for several miles, are entirely composed of it."----"The beach is covered with disjointed 

fragments, which have been detached from the cliff above, many of which weigh two or three 

tons."  There are three modes by which Dr. Paris conceives the lapidification of calcareous sand 

may be effected. 1st. "By the percolation of water through a hill of calcareous sand, by which it 

becomes impregnated with carbonate of lime." 2d. "The percolation of water through strata 

containing pyritical substances, by which it becomes impregnated with sulphuric salts." 3d. "The 

percolation of water through decomposing slate, or any ferruginous strata, by which it becomes 

impregnated with iron alumina, and other mineral matter."     ART. V. _Localities of Minerals._ 

_To the Editor of the American Journal of Science, &c._    NEW-YORK, Dec. 21, 1818.    DEAR 

SIR,  It is desirable that some mode should be adopted by which the public may become 

acquainted with all the _New American Localities of Minerals_, as they are discovered from time to 

time. With deference I would suggest, that in each number of your Scientific Journal, new localities 

might be recorded in alphabetical order, for present information and future reference.  The 

following localities, which have come under my observation, and which are probably not noticed in 

any work, are at your service.    1. _Agate._ Rolled mass: occurred near Powles Hook, New-

Jersey.    2. _Apatite._ Truncated crystals of one inch, and amorphous;   occurs in granite, chiefly 

in the felspar. Corlaer's Hook,   vicinity of New-York.    3. _Brown Mammillary Hematite_, covering 

quartz crystals.   Perkiomen lead-mine. Montgomery county, Pennsylvania.    4. _Carbonate of 

Magnesia._ Structure earthy. Apparently a _pure_   carbonate of magnesia. In mica slate, and 

granite; chiefly in the   quartz. Roxborough, 


_
and I'll be singed if there was a cloud in the sky all through them seven days--and the feller lost his 

job. Now the way I look at the game is this: we got a big chance to win and we got a big chance to 

lose, and if we do the things we oughter do it's goin' to be bright and fair, and if we do the things 

we hadn't oughter do it's goin' to be dark and stormy,--and I got my ijeers which is which. But, as I 

said, it don't do too much good to tell _everythin'_ you know."  "It'll be an awful fight," said Snubby; 

"a terrible fight every single minute of the time, and I'll bet you two cents to a tin whistle that when 

that Jefferson crowd of heavy-weights gets through they'll know they've been playing somebody. I 

wish there were something I could do. I'm so doggone restless that I don't believe I'll sleep a wink 

to-night."  Old Jerry gave voice to a cackle of mirth. "Bet you'll sleep all right," he said. "I never yet 

seen a feller like you that didn't sleep when the time come for it, and as for helping, I guess you'll 

do your part if you keep on believin' that Ridgley School can't be beat and when the game is goin' 

on you yell your dumdest to encourage the team."  "Well," said Snubby, "I suppose you want to go 

on readin' that lurid-looking book of yours, so I'll be going up to my room, I guess."  "It ain't so 

lurid," said Jerry, "but it's interestin' 'cause it's kind o' teachin' me how to put two and two together 

so's they'll figger up to make four, if you know what I mean, and then I'm a mite stirred up myself 

about that game to-morrer and it's quietin' to my nerves."  So Snubby Turner left his friend in the 

little basement room, walked quietly up the stairs to his room and made up his mind that the best 

thing for him to do was to turn in.  Mass meetings, preliminary games and final practice were over 

and everything now awaited the climax of the season. By half-past nine lights were going out in 

the dormitories and presently quiet reigned over the white buildings on the hill and the stars, 

sending down their radiance from a clear sky, presaged fair weather for the great contest. The 

light was out in Teeny-bits' room and no one in the school--with the exception of two persons--

doubted that the smallest member of the eleven was not sleeping soundly beneath the roof of 

Gannett Hall.  Saturday morning dawned as fair as the fairest day in the year; there was a nip in 

the air that suggested winter, but as the morning wore on, the mounting sun mellowed the chill 

until the "old boys"--men who had played for Ridgley and Jefferson twenty years before and who 

had come back to view once again the immortal combat between the "best school in all the world" 

and her greatest rival--slapped each other on the back and said:  "Perfect football weather!"  All 

roads led to Ridgley--or seemed to--on this day of days. The trains came rolling into the Hamilton 

Station, discharged their burdens of humanity and rolled on. Automobiles by the score climbed the 

long hill to the school,--automobiles bearing the fluttering red of Ridgley and the fluttering purple of 

Jefferson. There were shouts of greeting and shouts of gay challenge, honking of horns and a 

busy rushing here and there that suggested excitement, anticipation and hopes built high. And 

then came the special train from Jefferson--the Purple Express, so named--bearing hundreds of 

cheering students and a brass band of twenty pieces which led the procession into Lincoln Hall to 

the strains of the Jefferson Victory Song,--a fiendish piece of music in the ears of Ridgley's loyal 

sons, a stirring pean of confidence and challenge in the ears of those who waved aloft the purple. 

At Lincoln Hall the Jefferson guests--according to immemorial custom--sat down to a luncheon 

that Ridgley School provided. A year later the compliment would be returned. The band played, 

the visitors cheered, the song leader jumped on a table and swung his arms in time to the latest 

Jefferson song,--and all Ridgley School knew that Jefferson was having the time of her life. She 

had come to her rival with the best team in her history and she meant to enjoy every moment of a 



triumph which she was confident would be colossal. In all this excitement Teeny-bits' absence was 

not at first noticed. At breakfast some one asked for him and some one else said:  "I guess he's 

already eaten and gone; he probably didn't want to listen to our football gossip."  During the 

course of the morning two members of the faculty called for him--Doctor Wells and Mr. Stevens. 

They had an identical thought in mind--though neither knew that the other was thinking it. They 

were busy in extending the hospitality of Ridgley to the members of the Jefferson faculty and in 

greeting the "old boys" who had returned for the big game, but both wanted to have a word with 

Teeny-bits,--to tell him that they had confidence in him and that they knew everything would turn 

out right in the end and that they should watch him with special interest this afternoon and knew 

that he would forget everything else and play his best for Ridgley. They left word for him at the 

dormitory.  This was no ordinary game of football--Ridgley-Jefferson games never were ordinary--

and this would transcend all past contests between the two schools. Jefferson was said to be 

irresistible; the Ridgleyites knew that the spirit of their team was irresistible, and when two 

"irresistible" forces come together something must give way. From Springfield, the nearest large 

city, came numerous copies of the _Springfield Times_ with pictures of all the players and 

statistics in regard to age, weight and height. The largest amount of space was given to Norris, the 

Jefferson full-back, but Neil Durant came in for his share and a paragraph was devoted to Teeny-

bits who was described in these words:  "The Ridgley left-half will be the lightest player on the 

field; he cannot be expected to do much against the heavy Jefferson line, but he has gained a 

reputation as a shifty runner and deserves to be watched on open plays."  At noon, when Teeny-

bits did not appear for the special luncheon that was served to the members of the team in the 

trophy room of the gymnasium, Neil Durant and Coach Murray began to make inquiries.  "Where's 

Teeny-bits?"  Nobody had an answer.     5. _Common Jasper._ Traversed by veins of semi-opal. 

Small   detached masses, frequently waterworn. Rhinebeck, Dutchess   county, New-York.    6. 

_Compact Malachite._ Perkiomen lead-mine.    7. _Fetid Carbonate of Lime._ In ridges; and strata 

nearly   vertical, sometimes containing petrifactions. Very frequent in   Dutchess county, 

particularly in the neighbourhood of Rhinebeck   Flats, and near Hyde Park.    8. _Fibrous Talc._ In 

granite. Roxborough.    9. _Graphic Granite._ North River, near the city of New-York.    10. 

_Graphite._ In a calcareo-siliceous gangue. Corlear's Hook.    11. _Native pulverulent_ (or rather 

granular) _Sulphur_. In   pyritical quartz. Barren Hill, Montgomery county, Pennsylvania.    12. 

_Plumose Asbestus._ Corlaer's Hook.    13. _Semi-opal._ In common Jasper--(which see.)    14. 

_Scaly Talc._ In granite. Roxborough.    15. _Stellated Quartz._ Perkiomen lead-mine.    16.

New-York.    17. _Sulphuret of Silver._ With sulphuret of lead. Same locality.    18. _Tourmalin._ In 

masses of crystalline quartz. Rhinebeck.    Very respectfully,    F. C. SCHAEFFER.         *       * 

*       *       *  The following notices were prepared before the receipt of the above letter.   _Other 

Localities of Minerals and of_ ANIMAL REMAINS, _and acknowledgments of Specimens 

received_.  _Guadeloupe._--Native sulphur, obsidian, pitchstone, native alum, basaltic 

hornblende, alum covered with sulphur.  _Porto Rico._--Hexagonal crystals of mica.  Specimens of 

the above minerals are in the cabinet of Mr. John P. Brace, at Litchfield, Connecticut. 

_Molybdena_ is found in Shutesbury, Massachusetts, near Northampton, east of Connecticut 

River, on the land of William Eaton. It is the common sulphuret, but remarkably beautiful and well 



characterized. Its colour is nearly that of bright lead, very brilliant, smooth, and almost unctuous; 

soft, flexible, distinctly foliated, and the folia are very thin, and easily separable, almost like mica. It 

gives the usual greenish trace on white pottery, while a line drawn parallel on the same basis, by a 

piece of plumbago or black-lead, is black; this being (as pointed out by Brongniart) the easiest 

criterion, by which to distinguish between molybdena and plumbago, or black-lead. We have many 

times applied it with entire success.  This molybdena, from Shutesbury, is chiefly crystallized, and 

the crystals are, in some instances, very distinct; their form is that of a flat six-sided prism, or what 

is commonly called a table. The rock, from which they were obtained, is a granitic aggregate, 

(judging from the specimen sent, it may be a true granite) and the forms of the crystals are very 

distinctly impressed in the stone, so that when removed they leave an exact copy or crystal mould. 

In a letter from the proprietor of the land, it is said that the molybdena is found in a ledge of rocks, 

six or seven feet above the surface of the earth, and about ten or twelve feet above the level of the 

water; the direction of the rocks is from S. to N. E. by N.; the metal is in a vein, running E., and 

was discovered in small pieces in the top of the ledge. After putting in two blasts, some large 

pieces were obtained.  From this account, and from the specimens, (some of the crystals being an 

inch or more in length) this must be one of the most interesting localities of molybdena hitherto 

observed in this country; and it is hoped Mr. Eaton will take some pains to procure and furnish 

specimens.  _Rose Quartz._--From Southbury, Connecticut, not far from Woodbury, and from the 

Housatonick River, two young men, of the name of Stiles, have brought us specimens of _rose 

quartz_, of delicate and beautiful colour. It is said to be abundant in a ledge of the same 

substance.  _Plumbago._--In Cornwall, Litchfield county, Connecticut, plumbago is found, of a 

good quality, and in considerable masses, in a vein contained in a rock of gneiss, or mica-slate. It 

has been known a good while, and is said to have been exported anterior to the American 

revolutionary war.  _Coal, &c._ in Zanesville, Ohio. Through the kindness of the Rev. Dr. Bronson, 

Principal of the Cheshire Academy, we have received the following information.--In cutting a canal 

in the above town, in the spring of 1817, through freestone, trees, and fish, and other substances, 

both animal and vegetable, were taken out, alike petrified to a freestone, excepting the bark of a 

beach tree, which was very perfect and beautiful coal--(as we have had an opportunity of 

ascertaining, from an examination of the specimens.)  _Coal_, in the county of Muskingum, Ohio. 

Common stone-coal, highly bituminous, (the slaty or black coal of Werner,) is found abundantly. 

_South of Lake Erie_, about 25 miles, in the bed of Rocky River, are found shells, and other 

animal remains, imbedded in argillaceous iron; the specimens were collected in 1817, by the Rev. 

R. Searle.  _Mammoth's Tooth_, from the River St. Francis, west of Mississippi. Return J. Meigs, 

Esq. has transmitted, through the Rev. E. Cornelius, a mammoth's tooth, apparently not 

mineralized. It appears to have belonged to a very old animal, as the processes, (which, it is well 

known, are commonly very prominent) are worn down smooth, and some of them almost 

obliterated.  _Blue Ridge, Tennessee, and Mississippi Territory._--Through the kindness of the 

Rev. E. Cornelius, and of Mr. John H. Kain, we have received a considerable collection of 

specimens, illustrative of the mineralogy and geology, and Indian antiquities of these regions; they 

may be, on a future occasion, the subject of more particular remarks.  _Coal_, in Suffield, 

Connecticut, on the river of the same name. From Mr. Nathan Stedman, we have received 

specimens of coal, found in thin veins, in rocks of slate, and argillaceous sandstone, on the banks 



of the river. The veins are thin, but considerably numerous; the coal is very glossy and black; 

breaks with a smooth and almost conchoidal fracture, and very much resembles jet. It is very 

much intersected by thin veins--(not thicker than a knife-blade)--of white crystallized calcareous 

spar. This coal is bituminous, and burns pretty freely. It has not been explored, 


_
be late to-day, though."  When the luncheon was half-eaten Neil Durant got up and announced 

that he was going to send some one to look for the missing member of the team. He found Snubby 

Turner and asked him to run up to Gannett Hall and look for Teeny-bits.  When Snubby came back 

at the close of the except superficially.  _Coal_, in Southington, Connecticut. Beds of slate are 

found more or less bituminous; and, at the bottom of some of the wells, the slate begins to exhibit 

thin veins of coal, distributed in great numbers through the substance of the slate, which is the 

shale of the miners. The 


_
Teeny-bits was not in his room and that nobody, as far as he could discover, had seen him all the 

morning, Neil Durant said:  "Maybe he went home. We'll probably find him down at the locker 

building."  But when the members of the team arrived at the field half an hour later in order to 

prepare themselves leisurely for the game, Teeny-bits had not appeared.  "That's mighty queer," 

Neil said to Ned Stillson. "I can't understand it. If he doesn't come we'll have to play Campbell in 

his place--and somehow I haven't much faith in Campbell. I'm going to call up Mr. Holbrook at the 

Hamilton station and find out if he knows anything about Teeny-bits."  In answer to Neil's call, Mr. 

Holbrook's assistant reported that Mr. Holbrook had gone home to dinner and was not coming 

back till late in the afternoon; he was going to the of a finger; it is highly bituminous, and burns with 

great freedom. Even the entire masses of the stone burn brilliantly, when ignited on a common 

fire; and, after exhaustion of the coally matter, leave the slate of a grayish colour.  The locality 

from which the specimens were taken, is on the land of Roswell Moore, Esq. about midway 

between Hartford and New Haven. The spot was lately examined by Col. Gibbs, Eli Whitney, Esq. 

Professor Olmstead, and others; and arrangements are making to bore the strata, to the depth of 

several hundred feet, if necessary. These localities are in what may, with propriety, be called the 

coal formation of Connecticut. Coal has been found in several other places in that state; and the 

peculiar geological features of the region in which it is contained, are very interesting, and may

"The Holbrooks haven't a 'phone in their house, have they?" asked Neil.  "No, they haven't," came 

the reply.  "Well, do you know where Teeny-bits is?"  "Why, up at the school, I suppose; I haven't 

seen him," was the answer.  It was evident that Mr. Holbrook's assistant had no information; Neil 

hung up the receiver and said to himself:  "Well, if his father is coming that's a good sign. When 

Teeny-bits shows up, I'll give him a lecture that'll make his hair stand on  _Sulphat of Barytes, with 

Coal, &c._--Sulphat of barytes exists abundantly in Southington, on what is called the Clark Farm. 

With quartz, carbonate of lime, &c. it forms the gangue of a metallic vein, containing galena, or 

sulphuret of lead, copper pyrites, &c. The sulphat of barytes is more or less crystallized, and 

principally in the form that is called the coxcomb spar. The same vein, although it is in the side of a 

mountain, several hundred feet above the flat
