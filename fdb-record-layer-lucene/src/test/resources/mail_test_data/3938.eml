philodendron monstera hundred," replied father.  Without saying anything to=
 father about it, I made up my mind to get Nab back, if such a thing were p=
ossible.  The main feeding-ground of the band of seals from which we take o=
ur animals is just off Moss Beach, and I was almost certain that I could ge=
t a sight of Nab regard for the amenities of clubs, he left the table, Mr. =
Oxford, becoming more and more the dealer, rose and followed him, even dire=

ing anything to father about it, I made up my mind to get Nab back, if such=
 a thing were possible.  The main feeding-ground of the band of seals from =
which we take our animals is just off Moss Beach, and I was almost certain =
that I could get a sight of Nab regard for the amenities of clubs, he left =
the table, Mr. Oxford, becoming more and more the dealer, rose and followed=

keep him quiet, he would swallow it and be ready for the next before I coul=
d get a second fish from=20

the sack. He would eye a shad in my hand as closely as he had once watched =
the young salmon=20

darting about in the waters of Monterey Bay. And the instant I let go of it=
, intending to drop it into=20

the open mouth of the next seal, Nab would snap it as it fell.  He learned =
quickly the trick that all=20

trained seals know--that of balancing a ball on the nose. But for a seal th=
at is not much of a feat=20

after the experience of keeping themselves constantly in poise amidst the r=
olling breakers and=20

surging swells. I taught him to rise on his flippers and march, also to tur=
n to right or left at the=20

word.  But his education had not proceeded very far when he picked up of hi=
s own account the=20

trick that none of his predecessors had been able to acquire--how to escape=
 from the little shed,=20

where all a seal's splashing must be in a square tank, and to be free again=
 in the boundless=20

Pacific.  There were two rooms in the seal-house, one at the back for the a=
nimals, and one in front=20

for the boat, fish-lines and crates. The seal quarters had no outside door,=
 the only exit being into=20

the front room.  Father, unusually tired one night after we had both been o=
ut all day for fish, went=20

down alone to feed the seals. It was nearly dark, and he closed the outside=
 door without catching=20

it. When he opened the inside door and began to distribute the bass, Nab to=
ok advantage of the=20

dusk to steal every fish he could get his nose in reach of. It seemed impos=
sible to get a mouthful=20

to any other seal in the lot; and father, at last quite out of patience, ga=
ve him a smart cut over his=20

stubby little ears with the training whip.  Nab gave a shrill yelp, dived b=
etween father's legs, and=20

slid out into the boat room, the door to which had been left ajar. A seal p=
resents an awkward=20

appearance hobbling on his queer flippers, but he can make rapid progress. =
Before father could=20

get his balance and start after him, Nab was well out into the boat room.  =
Father stopped only to=20

close the door against the rest of the seals, and was again in pursuit; but=
 Nab in the meantime had=20

reached the far end, bumped against the unfastened door and was scuttling a=
cross the outer=20

threshold. Father ran after him, only to see his body floundering from one =
rock to another and to=20

hear its happy splash in greatest scandal that ever was. Witt is threatenin=
g proceedings. I offered=20

to take the whole lot back at the price he paid me, without any commission.=
 But he won't. He's an=20

old man; a bit of a maniac I expect, and he won't. He's angry. He thinks he=
's been swindled, and=20

what he says is that he's going to see the thing through. I've got to prove=
 to him that the pictures=20

are yours. I've got to show him what grounds I had for giving my guarantee.=
 Well, to cut a long=20

story short, I've found you, I'm glad to say!"  He sighed again.  "Look her=
e," said Priam. "How=20

much has Witt paid you altogether for my pictures?"  After a pause, Mr. Oxf=
ord said, "I don't mind=20

giving you the figure. He's paid me seventy-two thousand pounds odd." He sm=
iled, as if to excuse=20

himself.  When Priam Farll reflected that he had received about four hundre=
d pounds for those=20

pictures--vastly less than one per cent, of what the shiny and prosperous d=
ealer had ultimately=20

disposed of them for, the traditional fury of the artist against the dealer=
--of the producer against the=20

parasitic middleman--sprang into flame in his heart. Up till then he had ne=
ver had any serious=20

cause of complaint against his dealers. (Extremely successful artists seldo=
m have.) Now he saw=20

dealers, as the ordinary painters see them, to be the authors of all evil! =
Now he understood by=20

what methods Mr. Oxford had achieved his splendid car, clothes, club, and m=
inions. These things=20

were earned, not by Mr. Oxford, but _for_ Mr. Oxford in dingy studios, even=
 in attics, by shabby=20

industrious painters! Mr. Oxford was nothing but an opulent thief, a grinde=
r of the face of genius.=20

Mr. Oxford was, in a word, the spawn of the devil, and Priam silently but s=
incerely consigned him=20



to his proper place.  It was excessively unjust of Priam. Nobody had asked =
Priam to die. Nobody=20

had asked him to give up his identity. If he had latterly been receiving te=
ns instead of thousands=20

for his pictures, the fault was his alone. Mr. Oxford had only bought and o=
nly sold; which was his=20

true function. But Mr. Oxford's sin, in Priam's eyes, was the sin of having=
 been right.  It would have=20

needed less insight than Mr. Oxford had at his disposal to see that Priam F=
arll was taking the=20

news very badly.  "For both our sakes, _cher maitre_," said Mr. Oxford pers=
uasively, "I think it will=20

be advisable for you to put me in a position to prove=20


_
We both felt sorry to lose Nab, for the buyers will always pick out a livel=
y fellow and pay a better=20

price for him than for another, even though he be larger.  "Couldn't we tra=
p him again?" I asked.  "I=20

guess you'd have an interesting time catching as smart a seal as that after=
 he's already been once=20

landed," said father. "One my guarantee to Witt was justified."  "Why for b=
oth our sakes?"=20

"Because, well, I shall be delighted to pay you, say thirty-six thousand po=
unds in acknowledgment=20

of--er--" He stopped.  Probably he had instantly perceived that he was comm=
itting a disastrous=20

error of tact. Either he should have offered nothing, or he should have=20


_
of them that have slipped out of the lasso I've got hold of again; but if a=
 seal gets away after he's=20

had one full sniff of civilization he doesn't very often get near enough fo=
r a second."  "Would you=20

know him if you should see him?" I asked.  "I don't think we'll ever get th=
at near, but we might=20

come to within hearing distance, and I offered the whole sum he had receive=
d less a small=20

commission. To suggest dividing equally with Priam was the instinctive impu=
lse, the fatal folly, of a=20

born dealer. And Mr. Oxford was a born dealer.  "I won't accept a penny," s=
aid Priam. "And I can't=20

help you in any way. I'm afraid I must go now. I'm late as it is."  His col=
d resistless=20
