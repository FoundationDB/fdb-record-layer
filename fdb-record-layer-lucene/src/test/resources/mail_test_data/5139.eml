I was helping myself to potatoes as I made this observation in a tone of ea=

nd was at once overcome with remorse and confusion; her neck and face were =
suffused with a glow which produced the immediate effect upon my sensitive =
nature of _
little den inside, so dark that the outer sunshine made the old shopman bli=
nk as he stood in the=20

doorway talking with the stranger. The stranger was a Medicine Man, and he =
had just sold a bottle=20

of his famous Elixir of Life to the old shopkeeper.  "Yes, sir," said the M=
edicine Man, as he turned=20

to go, "you will find my Magic Elixir all that I claim it to be. It will br=
ing back youth and beauty to the=20

aged. It will give sight to eyes that see not, hearing to deaf ears, speech=
 to the tongue-tied and=20

motion to limbs that have never moved before. It will also cure whooping-co=
ugh."  "I hope so," said=20

the old man in an eager voice. He had heard only one word in six of the str=
anger's talk. "I hope so,=20

for I need it very much. Shall I take it all at once, or--" But already the=
 Medicine Man was halfway=20

down the road, with the gold coin which the old man had given him safe in h=
is deepest pocket. The=20

old man returned into his shop, blinking more than ever, and stumbling over=
 the piled-up rubbish=20

as he went. It was an abominably crowded little room. Each corner, each she=
lf, each hook in wall=20

or ceiling was occupied. Everything was piled high or filled up with someth=
ing else.  In the midst of=20

all kinds of curiosities, the Lion Passant stood waiting. He had been waiti=
ng there so many years=20

that the Old Curiosity Shop man had quite given up hope that any one would =
ever come for him.=20

The Lion was very old; older than the shop, older than the old man who kept=
 it, older than anything=20

else in the shop--and that was saying much.  The Lion was cobwebby and scar=
red; but,=20

notwithstanding, he was a fine figure of a the door open as I was writing t=
he above, and I was=20

totally unconscious as I was reading fervently aloud the last paragraph, co=
ntaining those=20

aspirations which I promised to confide to the public, that I had already a=
 listener. Judge of my=20

surprise--I may say dismay--when, just as I had finished, and was biting th=
e end of my pen for a=20

new inspiration, I heard the voice of Grandon close behind my chair. "Well =
done, my dear Frank,"=20

he said--and as he has known me from my boyhood, he can make allowances for=
 my fervent=20

nature. "Your programme is very complete, but I doubt your being able to ca=
rry it out. How, for=20

instance, do you propose to open the campaign against the Church?"  If ther=
e is one quality upon=20

which I pride myself more than another it is readiness. I certainly had not=
 formed the slightest=20

conception of how these burning thoughts of mine should be put into executi=
on; but I did not=20

hesitate a second in my answer. "I shall go down to a bishop and stay with =
him in his palace," I=20

replied, promptly.  "Which one?" said Grandon.  I was going to say "Oxbridg=
e," as he is the only=20

one I happen to know; but, in the first place, I am a little afraid of him;=
 and, in the second, I am=20

hardly on sufficiently intimate terms with him to venture to propose myself=
--so I said, with some=20

effrontery, "Oh, to a colonial bishop, whom you don't know."  "Nor you eith=
er, I suspect," laughed=20

Grandon. "Just at present colonial bishops are rather scarce articles, and =
I have never heard of=20

one in England with a palace, though there are a good many of them dotted a=
bout in snug livings,=20

retaining only their lawn sleeves,=20


_
warm gules, though now somewhat faded. He was carved in the attitude of mar=
ching along a parti-

colored pole of gules and silver. His dexter paw was raised in the air, his=
 red tongue hung out and=20

his tail was curved gracefully over his back. There was something which I c=
annot exactly describe=20

of grand and dignified about the Lion Passant,--what the books call a "deca=
yed gentility."=20

[Illustration: HE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY TALKING WITH THE STRANGER]  The old =
man=20

stumbled and blinked his way toward the door at the rear of the shop. He wa=
s eager to try the=20

Elixir of Life and become young again, and he hurried faster than was wise =
in the shadowy=20

labyrinth. Just as he was opposite the Lion Passant, he caught his foot in =
a sprawling chair and=20

stumbled forward, with both arms stretched out to save himself. Away flew t=
he bottle of Elixir,=20

_smash_! against the head of the Lion Passant. The glass shivered into a th=
ousand pieces, and=20

the precious golden drops went trickling down over the carved beast, over t=
he table, onto the floor,=20

where it made a dusty pool about the feet of a cracked china cat.  "Oh, me!=
 Oh, me!" groaned the=20

old man. "All my precious youth wasted, and no money left to buy more! Oh, =
me! What an unlucky=20

day it is!" And he stumbled out to tell his wife all about it. Now, as soon=
 as he had left the shop,=20

strange things began to happen there.  "Marry, come up!" exclaimed the Lion=
, licking his red=20

tongue. "I am a-weary of this. My leg is asleep." And he set down the dexte=
r paw, which he had=20

been holding in that position for four hundred years or more.  "Wow!" cried=
 the China Cat from the=20

floor. "My cracks are growing together again! I believe I am as good as new=
!" And she arched her=20

back and yawned.  The Lion lashed his tail once, to be sure that he could r=
eally do it, and looked=20

about the shop in disgust. "I must away!" he said.  "Oh!" cried the Cat, la=
zily, beginning to lick her=20

paw, as if she had always been doing so since the discovery of China. "You =
are so restless!=20

Where are you going?"  The Lion stepped gingerly down from his striped pole=
 to the table, and=20

from there to the floor. As he did so, he seemed to increase in size, so th=
at by the time he had=20

reached the shop door he was as large as an ordinary lion. "I am going to s=
eek _Them_," said the=20

Lion, with dignity. "I am, as you see, a Lion Passant, the crest of a noble=
 house. Many years I=20

have been separated from my people. I have waited for Them to come for me. =
Every time the=20

shop-bell tinkled it has waked an echo of hope in my heart. But They do not=
 come; I must, then, go=20

to Them." He sighed deeply.  "How will you know where to find them?" asked =
the Cat, respectfully.=20

"I shall seek Them in the halls of the mighty," said the Lion proudly. "The=
y were of the noblest in=20

the land, I remember."  "By what name shall you know them?" asked the Cat a=
gain, who was=20

inquisitive.  The Lion became thoughtful. "The name?" he repeated. "The nam=
e? I have forgot the=20

name. But I was the crest that They bore in battle, the figure on their shi=
elds, the carving above=20

their hearths."  "Yes, but times have changed, folk say," objected the Cat.=
 "How shall you know=20

your people among the New Ones?"  "I shall recognize Them," said the Lion c=
onfidently. "I shall=20

know Them, the proudest, the mightiest, the bravest, and most fair. Besides=
, is there not the family=20

tradition? Once, in the far ages before even I was carved, the first knight=
 of our line had an=20

adventure with a lion; hence my figure upon Their crest. I know not the tal=
e complete; but this I=20

know--that from that time on, no one of Them has been able to see a lion, t=
o speak or hear the=20

name, without sneezing thrice. So it was in that day, so it has been ever s=
ince."  "That, indeed, is=20

something definite," yawned the Cat, as the Lion stalked out into the sunsh=
ine. "Well, I'm glad I=20

have no tradition but one of comfort." And she curled herself up on a piece=
 of ancient gold=20

brocade.  So the Lion went forth to seek his people. He had not gone far be=
fore he overtook the=20



Medicine Man, who had sold no Elixir since leaving the Curiosity Shop. The =
Lion padded up=20

behind him so silently that the man did not hear him until he was quite clo=
se; then the Lion gave a=20

gentle roar.  "Abracadabra!" cried the man, turning pale and shaking till h=
is teeth rattled. He was=20

so ignorant that he did not know a Heraldic Device when he saw one. But he =
had seen pictures in=20

books and knew that this brilliant red beast was no ordinary lion.  "Kind y=
outh," said the Lion=20

grandly, lifting his paw and curving his tail in the old way, "I owe you mu=
ch. Your Magic Elixir has=20

given me life and motion. If there is aught I can do for you, I shall be gl=
ad."  The man's face was=20

full of wonder. "You owe much to the Elixir?" he cried. "Oh, pray explain!"=
  So the Lion explained.=20

When he had finished the simple story, the Medicine Man's face was illumine=
d with a great idea.=20

"It is magnificent!" he cried. "It is beyond my wildest dreams. For, to tel=
l you the truth--but why tell=20

the truth? This justifies me, certainly. Now, if you would but go with me a=
s a Living Testimonial?"=20

The Lion bowed. He did not like the idea, for it threatened notoriety; but =
he felt a sense of duty.=20

"_Noblesse oblige_," he murmured. "It is Our motto. Nothing can hurt my pri=
de, if it has a=20

foundation upon truth. I will go with you until I feel that my debt is paid=
."  "It is well!" said the man.=20

And they journeyed together. Naturally, the appearance of a warm crimson li=
on caused=20

considerable excitement in the streets of Kisington. Folk crowded around hi=
m and the Medicine=20

Man, and when they heard his story, they bought eagerly of the Elixir. "He =
is the crest of a noble=20

house come to life!" they whispered among themselves. "What noble house?" T=
he Lion listened=20

eagerly for the answer; but heads were shaken in reply. No one recognized t=
he device.  There was=20

one thing which annoyed the Lion. This was the tendency of the Medicine Man=
 to exaggerate the=20

powers of his Elixir. As time went on, he began to add the oddest stories t=
o the one he told about=20

the Lion. Was that not wonderful enough? The Lion was astonished, shocked, =
outraged. He=20

protested, but in vain. The habit of exaggeration, once contracted, becomes=
 a terrible master. The=20

Medicine Man seemed unable longer to speak the truth.  One morning when he =
was telling his=20

wicked lies to a company of trusting women and children, the Lion rose from=
 the center of the=20

eager circle and stalked away from the Medicine Man. "_Noblesse oblige_," h=
e said. And they=20

never saw each other again. I dare say the seller of the Elixir and his des=
cendants have been=20

doing business in the same way ever since.  Now, the Lion journeyed for man=
y or remind them of=20

the dignity and the hardships of which they did not die abroad. Their tempt=
ations are of a totally=20

different nature from theirs who are members of the House of Peers, and the=
y must be treated=20

apart; in fact, you will have to take them with the missionaries and coloni=
al clergy. I quite agree=20

with you that if there is one thing that is more urgently needed than a mis=
sionary to the ball-room,=20

it is a missionary to the missionaries; and as you have had so much experie=
nce of their operations=20

abroad, you might become a very useful labourer in the ecclesiastical viney=
ard."  I need scarcely=20

say that my heart leaped at the thought; it was a work for which I felt mys=
elf specially qualified.=20

"Why," I have thought, "should there be a set of men who preach to others, =
and are never=20

preached at themselves? Every class and condition of life has its peculiar =
snares and temptations,=20

and one class is set apart to point them out--surely there should be somebo=
dy to perform that kind=20

office for them which they do for others. He who is paid to find out the mo=
te that is in his brother's=20

eye, and devotes his energies to its discovery, is of all men the one who r=
equires the most kind=20

and faithful friend to show him the beam which is in his own. I will be tha=
t friend, and charge=20

nothing for it," thought I.  Grandon saw the flush of enthusiasm which moun=
ted to my brow, and=20



looked grave.  "My impulsive friend," he said, "this is a very serious subj=
ect; we must beware lest=20

we fall into the error which we blame in others. It is one thing to see the=
 need of the missionary, it=20

is another to rush headlong upon the work. However, I am able to offer you =
an opportunity of=20

beginning at once, for I have just come to tell you that Dickiefield has gi=
ven us a joint invitation to=20

go down to-morrow to Dickiefield, to stay till Parliament opens; we shall b=
e certain to find a choice=20

assortment of pagan and theological curiosities in that most agreeable of c=
ountry-houses, and you=20

may possibly meet the identical colonial bishop at whose palace you propose=
d staying. The three=20

o'clock train lands us exactly in time for dinner. Will you come?"  "Of cou=
rse I will. Nothing would=20

justify my neglecting so promising a vineyard in which to commence my labou=
rs;" and I rubbed my=20

hands enthusiastically, and sat down to write a series of those "consecrate=
d lies" by means of=20

which dinner engagements, already accepted, are at the last moment evaded. =
     DICKIEFIELD,=20

_4th February_.  The party here consists of old Lady Broadhem, with that ve=
ry aspiring young=20

nobleman, her son, the young Earl (old Lord Broadhem died last year), and h=
is sisters, Ladies=20

Bridget and Ursula Newlyte, neither of whom I have seen since they emerged =
from the nursery.=20

They had all disappeared to dress for dinner, however, and Dickiefield had =
not come home from=20

riding, so that when Grandon and I entered the drawing-room, we found only =
the deserted=20

apparatus of the afternoon tea, a Bishop, and a black man--and we had to in=
troduce ourselves.=20

The Bishop had a beard and an apron, his companion a turban, and such very =
large shoes, that it=20

was evident his feet were unused to the confinement. The Bishop looked ster=
n and determined;=20

perhaps there was just a dash of worldliness about the twist of his mustach=
e. His companion wore=20

a subdued and unctuous appearance; his face was shaved; and the whites of h=
is eyes were very=20

bloodshot and yellow. Neither of them was the least embarrassed when we wer=
e shown in;=20

Grandon and I both were slightly. "What a comfort that the snow is gone," s=
aid I to the Bishop.=20

"Yes," said his lordship; "the weather is very trying to me, who have just =
arrived from the Caribbee=20

Islands."  "I suppose you have accompanied his lordship from the Caribbee I=
slands," said I,=20

turning to the swarthy individual, whom I naturally supposed to be a specim=
en convert.  "No," he=20

said; "he had arrived some months since from Bombay."  "Think of staying lo=
ng in England?" said=20

Grandon.  "That depends upon my prospects at the next general election. I a=
m looking out for a=20

borough."  "Dear me!" said Grandon; and we all, Bishop included, gazed on h=
im with=20

astonishment.  "My name is Chundango," he went on. "My parents were both Hi=
ndoos. Before I=20

was converted my other name was Juggonath; now I am John. I became acquaint=
ed with a circle=20

of dear Christian friends in Bombay, during my connection, as catechist, wi=
th the Tabernacle=20

Missionary Society, was peculiarly favoured in some mercantile transactions=
 into which I=20

subsequently entered in connection with cotton, and have come to spend my f=
ortune, and enter=20

public life, in this country. I was just expressing to our dear friend here=
," pointing in a patronising=20

way towards the Bishop, "my regret at finding that he shares in views which=
 are becoming so=20

prevalent in the Church, and are likely to taint the Protestantism of Great=
 Britain and part of=20

Ireland."  "Goodness," thought I, "how this complicates matters! which of t=
hese two now stands=20

most in need of my services as a missionary?" As Dickiefield was lighting m=
e up to my bedroom, I=20

could not resist congratulating him upon his two guests. "A good specimen o=
f the 'unsound=20

muscular,' the Bishop," said I.  "Not very," said Dickiefield; "he is not s=
o unsound as he looks, and=20

he is not unique, like the other. I flatter myself I have under my roof the=
 only well-authenticated=20



instance of the Hindoo converted millionaire. It is true he became a 'Gover=
nment Christian' when=20

he was a poor boy of fifteen, and began life as a catechist; then he saw a =
good mercantile=20

opening, and went into cotton, out of which he has realised an immense fort=
une, and now is going=20

into political life in England, which he could not have done in an unconver=
ted condition. Who ever=20

heard before of a Bombay man wanting to get into Parliament, and coming hom=
e with a _carte du=20

pays_ all arranged before he started? He advocates extension of the franchi=
se, ballot, and the=20

Evangelical Alliance, so I thought I would fasten him on to Broadhem--they'=
ll help to float each=20

other."  "Who else have you got here besides?" I asked.  "Oh, only a petrol=
eum aristocrat from the=20

oil regions of America--another millionaire. He is a more wonderful instanc=
e even than=20

Chundango, for he was a poor man three months ago, when he 'struck oil.' Yo=
u will find him most=20

intelligent, full of information; but you will look upon him, of course, as=
 the type of the peculiar=20

class to which he belongs, and not of Americans generally." And my warm-hea=
rted and eccentric=20

friend, Lord Dickiefield, left me to my meditations and my toilet.  "I shal=
l probably have to take one=20

of these Broadhem girls in to dinner," thought I, as I followed the rustle=
=20


_
finding a trace of his family. He scanned carefully the entrance to every g=
reat palace and castle.=20

He caused some confusion in traffic by dashing out to examine the crests em=
blazoned upon the=20

panels of the chariots which passed him on the road. He even halted foot-pa=
ssengers to inquire,=20

courteously, if he might look more closely at certain devices upon chain or=
 brooch or bangle which=20

had caught his eye. Especially, he surprised with his attentions several pe=
rsons who had sneezed=20

violently in his presence. But in vain. He failed to find the clue he sough=
t.  Folk would fain have=20

helped him in his search; for his manners were gentle and gracious, and his=
 bearing unmistakably=20

noble. Folk liked him. Many would have been glad to prove themselves, throu=
gh him, scions of=20

that great family which he undoubtedly represented. But all their efforts t=
o sneeze at the right time=20

were fruitless. They went away crestfallen before his reproachful gaze. Som=
etimes, the Lion would=20

spy a lovely face, or a manly figure, which appealed strangely to him. "Sur=
ely," he would say to=20

himself, "surely, this noble-looking person is one of Them. Something seems=
 to tell me so!" And=20

he would assume his heraldic pose, with dexter paw lifted and eloquent tail=
 curved high, waiting=20

wistfully for the sneeze of recognition to follow. Sometimes, alas! came, i=
nstead, a laugh of scorn,=20

or an unkind word. He learned that noble figures and lovely faces do not al=
ways adorn like=20

natures.  Well, many months passed by. Footsore and weary, the Lion still t=
raveled upon his=20

quest. He felt very old and lonesome, homesick for his marble halls, hopele=
ss of finding them. He=20

came, one noon, to an  inn on the outskirts of Derrydown Village. Over the =
door of the inn a=20

signboard creaked and flapped in the wind. The Lion looked up. He beheld up=
on the sign the=20

picture of a red lion! The traveler was greatly moved. "Surely," he thought=
, "this must be the arms=20

of some great family in the down-stairs back to the drawing-room. So I rang=
ed myself near the one=20

with dark hair and blue eyes--I like the combination--to the great annoyanc=
e of Juggonath, who=20

had got so near her for the same purpose that his great foot was on her dre=
ss.  "I beg your=20

pardon, Mr Juggernaut," said I, giving him a slight shove, "I think you are=
 standing----"=20

"Chundango, sir, if you please," said he, unconsciously making way for me, =
"Juggonath is the=20

name which my poor benighted countrymen----"  "Juggernaut still speaking, a=
s they say in the=20

telegraphic reports from the House of Commons," I remarked to Lady Ursula, =
as I carried her off=20

triumphantly; and the Indian's voice was lost in the hum of the general mov=
ement towards the=20

dining-room.  I have promised not to shrink from alluding to those tender s=
ensibilities which an=20

ordinary mortal jealously preserves from the rough contact of his fellow-me=
n; but I am not an=20

ordinary mortal, and I have no hesitation in saying, that never in my life =
have I gone through such=20

a distinct change of feeling in the same period as during the two hours we =
sat at that dinner.=20

Deeply versed as I am in every variety of the sex, married or single, how w=
as I to know that Lady=20

Ursula was as little like the rest of the species as our Bombay friend was =
to wealthy Hindoos=20

generally? What reason had I to suppose that Lady Broadhem's daughter could=
 possibly be a new=20

type?  Having been tolerably intimate at Broadhem House before she was out,=
 I knew well the=20

atmosphere which had surrounded her youth, and took it for granted that she=
 had imbibed the=20

family views.  "Interesting creature, John Chundango, Esq.," said I, for I =
thought she had looked=20

grave at the flippancy of my last remark; "he has quite the appearance of a=
 'Brand.'"  "A what?"=20

said Lady Ursula, as she looked up and caught him glaring fixedly at her wi=
th his great yellow=20

eyeballs from the other side of the table.  "Of course I don't mean of the =
'whipper-in' of=20


_
explained things to the Landlord, that worthy dashed his hopes once more. N=
o family with such a=20

device was known in those parts.  "However," said the Landlord, eyeing the =
Lion appraisingly, "I=20

have an idea! If you will remain with me for some hours, I will show you so=
mething. The Prince=20

and his train are to pass here on their way to the Ancient Wood, where they=
 will hunt. In the=20

company will be all the grandest nobles of the Kingdom. Surely, some of you=
r family will be among=20

them. Here is a splendid viewpoint! Do you remain beside my door in your gr=
and attitude. You will=20

see and be seen. If your folks are there, you will be sneezed at; which is =
what you want. It will be,=20

beside, a grand advertisement for me--a real red lion guarding the Red Lion=
 Inn!"  The Lion=20

agreed. That night, when the Prince's cavalcade passed through Derrydown, h=
uge and red, with=20

lifted paw and curved tail, the beast stood at the door of the Red Lion Inn=
. Many stared in wonder.=20

Many paused to inquire. Many entered and partook of the dainties which Mine=
 Host had prepared=20

against this very happening. The Prince himself paused, pointed, and asked =
a question. The=20

Lion's heart leaped wildly! There was a curious expression on the Prince's =
face; it seemed drawn=20

and twisted--was he about to sneeze? Alas! No. With a harsh laugh, the Prin=
ce gave the Lion a cut=20

with his whip and bounded past; after him, the last of his followers. The L=
ion's skin smarted and=20

his heart writhed. He kept his temper with difficulty; but--it was the Prin=
ce. _Noblesse oblige_.=20

When they were out of sight, his head drooped. There was no one in all that=
 gallant company who=20

belonged to him. But the Landlord had reaped a rich harvest from the Lion's=
 presence. When once=20

more the village was empty of nobility, he came to the Lion, rubbing his ha=
nds, contentedly. "Old=20

fellow," he said, "I have had profit from you. Now, I will give you supper =
and a bed in my stable for=20

the night. And why should we not make this arrangement permanent? You see, =
your folks are=20

gone. The family has run out and no one any longer bears or recognizes the =
crest. one rescued=20

from fire. I understand that his great wealth, so far from having proved a =
snare to him, has enabled=20

him to join in many companies for the improvement of Bombay, and that his t=
heological views are=20

quite unexceptionable."  "If his conversion leads him to avoid discussing e=
ither his neighbours or=20

their theology, Lord Frank, I think he is a person whom we may all envy."  =
Is that a hit at her=20

mother or at me? thought I. At Broadhem House, society and doctrine used to=
 be the only topics of=20

discussion. My fair friend here has probably had so much of it that she has=
 gone off on another=20

tack; perhaps she is a "still deep fast" one. As I thought thus, I ran over=
 in my mind my young-lady=20

categories, as follows:--             {The wholly worldly     First, {     =
 and            {The worldly holy.  In=20

this case the distinction is very fine; but though they are bracketed toget=
her, there is an=20

appreciable difference, which perhaps, some day when I have time, I shall d=
iscuss.  Second, "The=20

still deep fast."  This may seem to be a contradiction in terms; but the fa=
ct is, while the upper=20

surface seems tranquil enough, there is a strong rapid undercurrent. The da=
nger is, in this case,=20

that you are very apt to go in what is called a "header." The moment you di=
ve you get caught by=20

the undercurrent, and the chances are you never rise to the surface again. =
 Third, "The rippling=20

glancing fast."  This is less fatal, but to my mind not so attractive as th=
e other. The ripples are=20

produced by quantities of pebbles, which are sure to give one what is calle=
d in America "a rough=20

time." The glancing is only dangerous to youths in the first stage, and is =
perfectly innocuous after=20

one season.  Fourth, "The rushing gushing fast."  This speaks for itself, a=
nd may be considered=20

perfectly harmless.  There are only two slows--the "strong-minded blue slow=
," and the "heavy=20

slow."  The "strong-minded blue slow" includes every branch of learning. It=
 is extremely rare, and=20



alarming to the youth of the day. I am rather partial to it myself.  The "h=
eavy slow" is, alas! too=20

common.  To return to Lady=20


_
orphan; but you can still be of use to me. Why not become the supporter of =
my inn?"  "Gramercy!"=20

quoth the Lion, with dignity. "I will accept the supper, for I am very hung=
ry. But as for sleeping in=20

the stable, that I cannot do! I prefer a bed on one of the fragrant haycock=
s in your meadow."  "To=20

that you are welcome, if you please," said the Landlord graciously. "And, t=
o-morrow, we will talk=20

again of the other matter."  So the Lion had his supper, and then went wear=
ily to sleep on a=20

haycock in the thymy meadow. He was sad and disillusioned, and the Landlord=
's words had taken=20

away his last hope. He began to wish that he had never come alive. "To-morr=
ow," he said, "I will=20

go back certainly neither of the "slows," I could see that in her eye, to s=
ay nothing of the retort; not=20

"rippling glancing," her eye was not of that kind either; certainly not "ru=
shing gushing." What=20

remained? Only "Wholly worldly," or "still deep fast."  These were the thou=
ghts that coursed=20

through my mind as I pondered over her last remark. I had not forgotten tha=
t I had a great work to=20

accomplish. The missionary spirit was ever burning within me, but it was ne=
cessary to examine the=20

ground before attempting to prepare it for seed. I'll try her as "still dee=
p," thought I.  "Did you go=20

out much last season?" I said, by way of giving an easy turn to the convers=
ation.  "No; we have=20

been=20


_
Shop, and see if the old man can un-medicine me. For a crest without a fami=
ly is even a more=20

forlorn thing than a family without a crest!"  The Lion wakened with a star=
t. "_Ker-chew! Ker-chew!=20

Ker-chew!_" sounded in his ear. He sprang to his feet and looked around. Op=
posite him stood a=20

little girl in a ragged We have always resisted leaving the country, but ma=
mma wants to make a=20

home for Broadhem."  "Ah! it is his first season, and naturally he will go =
out a great deal. Of course=20

you know the three reasons which take men into society in London," I said, =
after a pause.  "No, I=20

don't. What are they?"  "Either to find a=20
