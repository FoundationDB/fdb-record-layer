ch dracaena marginata muscle of its body by buzzing with its wings as it bu=
ries the instrument to its greatest depth. The blood starts from the wound =
immediately, and continues to flow for a considerable time; this is an attr=
action to other flies in great numbers, many of which would lay their eggs =
upon the wound.  "I much prefer the intense heat of summer to the damp of t=
he rainy season, which breeds all last interview, reminding him of his fine=
 castle, and expressing his conviction that the lord of such a domain must =
have much to do.  =E2=80=9CI will try to do it,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=
=80=9Cand will go down to Muriel tomorrow.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 89 Lothai=
r, who was very sensible to the charms of Nature, found at first relief in =
the beauties of Muriel. The season was propitious to the scene. August is a=
 rich _
permitted from below. I have employed the Arab women to make me a hunting-c=
ap of the basket-

work of dome palm, to my old pattern.  "August 28.--I have been busily empl=
oyed in putting new=20

soles to my shoes, having cut up the leather cover of a gun-case for materi=
al. No person can walk=20

barefooted in this country, as the grass is armed with thorns. A peculiar s=
pecies, that resembles a=20

vetch, bears a circular pod as large as a horse-bean; the exterior of the p=
od is armed with long=20

and sharp spikes like the head of an ancient mace; these pods when ripe are=
 exceedingly hard,=20

and falling to the ground in great numbers, the spikes will pierce the sole=
 of any shoe unless of a=20

stout substance.  "August 29.--Florian is very ill with fever. The mosquito=
es are so troublesome=20

that the Arabs cannot sleep in their huts, but are forced to arrange platfo=
rms about six feet high,=20

upon which the whole family rest until they are awakened by a sudden thunde=
rstorm, and are=20

compelled to rush into their huts;--this has been the case nightly for some=
 time past.  "I find that=20

the whole village has been trying on my new hunting-cap, that an Arab woman=
 has just completed;=20

this was brought to me to-day, thick with butter and dirt from their greasy=
 pates. This is a trifle:=20

yesterday Florian was ill and required some tea; his servant tried the degr=
ee of heat by plunging=20

his dirty black finger to the bottom.  "Shortly after our wild Arab lad, Ba=
cheet, was engaged, we=20

drilled him as table servant. The flies were very troublesome, and continua=
lly committed suicide by=20

drowning themselves in the tea. One morning during breakfast there were man=
y cases of felo de=20

se, or 'temporary insanity,' and my wife's tea-cup was full of victims; Bac=
heet, wishing to be=20

attentive, picked out the bodies with his finger and thumb!--'Now, my good =
fellow, Bacheet,' I=20

exclaimed, 'you really must not put your dirty fingers in the tea: you shou=
ld take them out with the=20

tea-spoon. Look here,' and I performed the operation, and safely landed sev=
eral flies that were still=20

kicking. 'But mind, Bacheet,' I continued, 'that you wipe the tea-spoon fir=
st, to be sure that it is=20

clean!' On the following morning at breakfast we covered up the cups with s=
aucers to prevent=20

accidents; but to our astonishment Bacheet, who was in waiting, suddenly to=
ok a tea-spoon from=20

the table, wiped it carefully with a corner of the table-cloth, and stoopin=
g down beneath the  =E2=80=9CI am=20

sure you mistake her,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Aldegonde, but not in a tone w=
hich indicated any confidence=20

in her remark. =E2=80=9CMamma is anxious about my brother, and all that.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI believe the duchess thinks=20

that I am in some way or other connected with this embarrassment; but I rea=
lly had nothing to do=20

with it, though I could not refuse my testimony to the charms of the young =
lady, and my belief she=20

would make Bertram a happy man.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAs for that, you know, G=
ranville saw a great deal more of=20

her, at least at Jerusalem, than you did, and he has said to mamma a great =
deal more than you=20

have done.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes; but she thinks that, had it not been for=
 me, Bertram would never have known=20

the Phoebus family. She could not conceal that from me, and it has poisoned=
 her mind.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COh! do=20

not use such words.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes; but they are true. And your sis=
ter is prejudiced against me also.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat=20

I am sure she is not,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Aldegonde, quickly. =E2=80=9CC=
orisande was always your friend.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CWell, they refused to see me, when we may never meet again for mon=
ths, perhaps for years,=E2=80=9D=20

said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cperhaps never.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat shocking thin=
gs you are saying, my dear lord, to-day! Here,=20

Lord Culloden wants you to return thanks for the bridesmaids. You must put =
on a merry face.=E2=80=9D  The=20

dreary day at last arrived, and very quickly, when Lothair was the only per=
son left in town. When=20

there is nobody you know in London, the million that go about are only voic=
eless phantoms.=20

Solitude in a city is a trance. The motion of the silent beings with whom y=
ou have no speech or=20

sympathy, only makes the dreamlike existence more intense. It is not so in =
the country; the voices=20



of Nature are abundant, and, from the hum of insects to the fall of the ava=
lanche, something is=20

always talking to you.  Lothair shrank from the streets. He could not endur=
e the dreary glare of St.=20

James=E2=80=99s and the desert sheen of Pall Mall. He could mount his horse=
 in the park, and soon lose=20

himself in suburban roads that he once loved. Yes; it was irresistible; and=
 he made a visit to=20

Belmont. The house was dismantled, and the gardens shorn of their lustre, b=
ut still it was there;=20

very fair in the sunshine, and sanctified in his heart. He visited every ro=
om that he had frequented,=20

and lingered in her boudoir. He did not forget the now empty pavilion, and =
he plucked some=20

flowers that she once loved, and pressed them to his lips, and placed them =
near his heart. He felt=20

now=20


_
the tea-spoon, several flies that were in the last extremity within a vesse=
l by no means adapted for=20

a spoon. Perfectly satisfied with the result, he carefully rewiped the tea-=
spoon upon the table-cloth,=20

and replaced it in its proper position. 'Oh Bacheet! Bacheet! you ignoramus=
, you extraordinary and=20

impossible animal!' However, there was no help for it--the boy thought he w=
as doing the right thing=20

exactly.  "September 1.--The animals are worried almost to death by the cou=
ntless flies, especially=20

by that species that drives the camels from the country. This peculiar fly =
is about the size of a=20

wasp, with an orange-coloured body, with black and white rings; the probosc=
is is terrific; it is=20

double, and appears to be disproportioned, being two-thirds the length of t=
he entire insect. When=20

this fly attacks an animal, or man, it pierces the skin instantaneously, li=
ke the prick of a red-hot=20

needle driven deep into the flesh, at the same time the want of sympathy.  =
He walked through the=20

park to the residence of Mr. Phoebus, where he had directed his groom to me=
et him. His heart=20

beat as he wandered along, and his eye was dim with tears. What characters =
and what scenes=20

had he not become acquainted with since his first visit to Belmont! And, ev=
en now, when they had=20

departed, or were absent, what influence were they not exercising over his =
life, and the life of=20

those most intimate with him! Had it not been for his pledge to Theodora, i=
t was far from=20

improbable that he would now have been a member of the Roman Catholic Churc=
h, and all his=20

hopes at Brentham, and his intimacy with the family on which he had most re=
ckoned in life for=20

permanent friendship and support, seemed to be marred and blighted by the w=
itching eyes of that=20

mirthful Euphrosyne, whose mocking words on the moonlit terrace at Belmont =
first attracted his=20

notice to her. And then, by association of ideas, he thought of the=20
