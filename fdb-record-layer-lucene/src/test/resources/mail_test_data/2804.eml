work. Could he not spare his people these sufferings? Was it impossible to =
reconcile the religion of=20

the city with the belief in one supreme God? After all, was the worship of =
those idols so false a=20

thing? did it not hold the germ of a great truth? And so Mohammad made his =
first and last=20

concession. He recited a revelation to the Kureysh, in which he spoke respe=
ctfully of the three=20

moon-goddesses, and asserted that their intercession with God might be hope=
d for: 'Wherefore=20

bow down before God and serve Him;' and the whole audience, overjoyed at th=

bowed down and worshipped at the name of the God of Mohammad--the whole cit=

reconciled to the double religion. But this Dreamer of the Desert was not t=

lie. At the price of the whole  =E2=80=9CI can=E2=80=99t believe it!=E2=80=

=E2=80=9D  Father Buck raised=20

his head and smiled. All the sadness left his eyes, and pride and gratefuln=
ess took its place.  =E2=80=9CNo,=20

White Tail,=E2=80=9D he replied. =E2=80=9CI cannot do it. I put in that jum=

don=E2=80=99t think I=E2=80=99m sad. I=E2=80=99m not. I knew it had to come=

=80=94because you have qualified so=20

well to be our leader. I am thankful for that.=E2=80=9D  But White Tail was=
 not convinced. It was hard for him=20

to accept the truth. Father Buck was still to him the finest, proudest, wis=
