the principal in this diabolical work, made there several invocations to th=

times, the whole of which took place between Easter and Ascension-day; and =
one grand=20

invocation on a Sunday, very early and before sun-rise, on a mountain near =
to the tower of Mont-

jay.  =E2=80=98The monk performed many superstitious acts near a bush, with=
 invocations to the devil; and=20

while doing these, he stripped himself naked to his shirt and kneeled down:=
 he then stuck the=20

points of the sword and dagger into the ground, and placed the ring near th=
em. Having uttered=20

many invocations to the devils, two of them appeared to him, in the shape o=
f two men, clothed in=20

brownish green, one of whom was called Hermias, and the other Estramain. He=
 paid them such=20

honours and reverence as were due to God our Saviour, after which he withdr=
ew behind the bush.=20

=E2=80=98The devil who had come for the ring took it and vanished; but he w=
ho was come for the sword and=20

dagger remained,=E2=80=94but afterward, having seized them, he also vanishe=
d. The monk, shortly after,=20

came to where the devils had been, and found the sword and dagger lying fla=
t on the ground, the=20

sword having the point broken,=E2=80=94but he saw the point among some powd=
er, where the devil had=20

laid it. Having waited for half an hour, the other devil returned, and gave=
 him the ring, which to the=20

sight was of the colour of red, nearly scarlet, and said to him, =E2=80=98T=
hou wilt put it into the mouth of a=20

dead man, in the manner thou knowest,=E2=80=99 and then he vanished. The mo=
nk obeyed his instructions,=20

thinking to burn the king our lord,=E2=80=94but through the providence of G=
od, and the aid of those most=20

excellent ladies the duchesses of Berry and Burgundy, who were present, he =
escaped.  =E2=80=98I shall=20

next show that the duke of Orleans was guilty of the crime of high treason =
in the first degree, by=20

the alliances he contracted contrary to the interest of the king and kingdo=
m. It is a fact, that when=20

the king our lord and king Richard of England were firmly united in friends=
hip, by the marriage of=20

Richard with the eldest princess of France, king Richard would, at any risk=
, speak to the king our=20

lord respecting his health; and when they were together, he told him, that =
the infirmity he was=20

subject to was caused by means used by the dukes of Orleans and of Milan, a=
nd entreated him,=20

by the love of God, to be on his guard against them.  =E2=80=98The king, af=
ter this conversation, conceived=20

so great a hatred against the duke of Milan, and not without cause, that th=
e herald who bore his=20

arms dared not appear in his presence. When this came to the ears of the du=
ke of Orleans, he=20

took a mortal dislike to king Richard, and inquired who was the greatest en=
emy he had in this=20

world. He soon learnt that it was Henry of Lancaster, to whom he made advan=
ces, and at length=20

concluded an alliance with him, in order to destroy the king, and to streng=
then himself as much as=20

possible, to arrive at his damnable ends.  =E2=80=98The duke of Orleans and=
 Henry of Lancaster agreed=20

mutually to labour and assist each other to accomplish the deaths of the tw=
o kings, that they might=20

obtain the crowns of France and England,=E2=80=94that of France for Louis d=
=E2=80=99Orleans, and that of England=20

for Henry of Lancaster.  =E2=80=98Henry succeeded in his attempt, but, than=
k God! the duke of Orleans has=20

failed. And to confirm the truth of this alliance, the duke of Orleans has =
ever been favourable to the=20

English, and has assisted Henry with all his power, and particularly in reg=
ard to the siege of the=20

castle of Bordes, when he sent to the garrison not to surrender it to the F=
rench, for that he would=20

hinder the success of the siege, and afford them sufficient succour when th=
ere should be need of=20

it. He also prevented many expeditions from taking place, which were intend=
ed against the=20

English.  =E2=80=98Thus he supposed, and often permit of a comparatively lo=
ng survival.  Fischer[624]=20

found only 104 cases of immediate death among 452 cases of wounds of the he=
art, and healing=20

occurred in 50 cases among 401. Vibert[625] mentions two striking cases of =
long survival after=20



wounds of the heart. A woman received a stab-wound which perforated the rig=
ht ventricle, causing=20

a wound one centimetre long. She did not die until twelve days later, when =
on autopsy there was=20

found an enormous extravasation of blood in the left pleural cavity and per=
icardium. The second=20

case, though one of bullet-wound, is equally applicable and instructive in =
this connection. A man=20

received a bullet-wound which perforated the left ventricle, the bullet bei=
ng found later in the=20

pericardium. After being wounded he threw a lamp at his assassin which set =
fire to the room. He=20

then went into the court-yard, drew some water, carried it back in a bucket=
, extinguished the fire,=20

and then lay down on his bed and died.  In studying the wounds of different=
 regions of the body,=20

we may find many other mortal wounds which, though speedily fatal, leave th=
e possibility of more=20

or less activity before death. We see, therefore, that even in those wounds=
 which are commonly=20

supposed to be immediately fatal, even by many medical men where attention =
has not been called=20

to the exceptions, such exceptional cases are not uncommon in which death i=
s not immediate.=20

Time and even strength may thus be allowed for more or less complicated act=
ivity. An alibi cannot,=20

therefore, be allowed without question on the part of the medical expert, w=
ho must exercise great=20

caution in expressing an opinion. The second question which may sometimes a=
rise in connection=20

with the last, but having little to do with the subject of this section, is=
 the following:  HOW LONG=20

BEFORE DEATH HAD THE DECEASED ACCOMPLISHED CERTAIN PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTS?=20

For instance, how long after a meal did he die? This is hard to answer with=
 precision, as digestion=20

varies with the individual, and digestion begun during life may go on to a =
certain extent after death.=20

We may be able to say if digestion has just commenced, is well advanced, or=
 has terminated.=20

What was eaten at the last meal may be learned by the naked eye, the micros=
cope, the color of=20

stomach contents and their odor. The state of the bladder and rectum is som=
etimes called in=20

question. All the above facts have less bearing on the case than those in r=
elation to the former=20

question.   THE CAUSE OF DEATH FROM WOUNDS.  The cause of death should be c=
ertain and=20

definite. In reality, there is only one real cause, though one or many circ=
umstances may be=20

accessory causes. In most cases of death from the class of wounds which we =
have been=20

considering, there is no difficulty in determining the cause of death so as=
 to be able to state it=20

definitely. But if the deceased had recovered from the first effects of the=
 wound and then died, or if=20

death seems as much due to disease as to injury, then the _real_ cause of d=
eath may be obscure.=20

If the medical witness is in doubt as to which of two causes was the primar=
y cause of death the=20

doubt should be stated at once, as it may weaken the testimony if brought o=
ut later.  Wounds may=20

be directly or indirectly fatal. They are directly fatal if the victim dies=
 at once or very soon after the=20

wound, with no other cause internally in his body or externally from his en=
vironment. Wounds are=20

indirectly or secondarily fatal if the injured person dies from a wound dis=
ease or complication, the=20

direct consequence of the wound, or from a surgical operation necessary in =
the treatment of the=20

case. Wounds may also be necessarily fatal either directly or secondarily, =
or not necessarily fatal.=20

In the latter case death may be due as much, if not more, to other=20


_
welfare of the kingdom, and committed high treason of the first degree, in =
a second manner. In=20

confirmation of this, a fact has just struck me which I will relate to you.=
 At the time when king=20

Richard was a prisoner, and it was the intention of Henry to have him put t=
o death, some of the=20

english lords said to him, that great danger might ensue from the indignati=
on of the French. Henry=20

replied, they need not have any fears on that head, for he had a powerful f=
riend in France, to=20

whom he had allied himself, namely, the duke of Orleans, brother to the kin=
g, who would not, for=20

any attempt that might be made on king Richard, suffer the French to attack=
 the English; and to=20

convince them, he made them read the letters that had passed, and the artic=
les of the treaty=20

concluded between them. It appears then, that the duke of Orleans has, in v=
arious ways,=20

committed high treason of the first degree.  =E2=80=98I shall now finish th=
is article of my minor, although=20

there be many other very horrible crimes perpetrated by the duke of Orleans=
 of the first degree of=20

high treason, which my lord of Burgundy reserves to charge him with at a pr=
oper opportunity,=20

should there be a necessity for it.  =E2=80=98I proceed to the second artic=
le of my minor, wherein I shall=20

charge the duke of Orleans with being guilty of the crime of high treason, =
not only in the first, but=20

also in the second degree, which consists in offending the king in the pers=
on of the queen his wife.=20

=E2=80=98It is a fact, that about four years after the king was attacked by=
 his unfortunate disorder, the=20

profligate duke of Orleans never ceased imagining how he could succeed in h=
is wicked and=20

damnable designs, and thought that if he could prevail on the queen to quit=
 the kingdom with her=20

children, he would the more readily at all to the wound itself. Thus death =
may be due to natural=20

causes, latent disease, an unhealthy state of the body, imprudence or negle=
ct of treatment, or=20

improper treatment, etc. These various degrees of responsibility of a wound=
 as the cause of death=20

we will now consider more at length.   I. WAS THE WOUND THE CAUSE OF DEATH =
DIRECTLY?=20

If so, it must have caused death in one of the following ways:  1. =3DHemor=
rhage.=3D=E2=80=94This may act by=20

producing syncope. But the amount of the hemorrhage may not be sufficient f=
or this result, and still=20

cause death by disturbing the function of the organ into which it is effuse=
d, as in the brain or in the=20

pleural or pericardial cavities. The blood here acts mechanically. Blood in=
 the trachea may also kill=20

mechanically by causing asphyxia.  The _amount_ of hemorrhage required to p=
roduce syncope=20

varies under a variety of circumstances. Less is required in the very young=
, the aged, and the=20

diseased, also less in women than in men. Young infants may die from hemorr=
hage from very=20

slight wounds, even from the application of a leech or the lancing of the g=
ums. A sudden loss of=20

blood is much more serious than an equal amount lost slowly. This is the re=
ason that the wound of=20

an artery is more serious and more rapidly fatal than a similar loss of blo=
od from other sources. It=20

is hard to specify the absolute quantity which must be lost in order to cau=
se death by syncope.=20

The total blood in the body is about one-thirteenth of the weight of the bo=
dy, making the total=20

amount of blood weigh about twelve pounds. Of this, about one-fourth is in =
the heart, lungs, and=20

large blood-vessels. According to Watson, the loss of an amount varying fro=
m five to eight pounds=20

is enough to be fatal to an adult. But less is enough to prove fatal=20


_
intent, he falsely informed her, that the king was very indignant against h=
er,=E2=80=94and advised her, as=20

she regarded her own life and the lives of her children, to quit the presen=
ce of the king and to=20

leave the country.  =E2=80=98He offered to conduct her and them to the duch=
y of Luxembourg (thinking that=20

when there he could do with them as he pleased), and promised the queen tha=
t he would there=20

safely guard her and her children. He added, that should blood and the age,=
 sex, and bodily=20

condition of the wounded person affect the amount necessary. Though death f=
rom a small artery is=20

slower than that from a large one, yet it may occur in time, as shown in th=
e instance quoted by=20

Taylor,[626] where a man bled to death in thirty-eight hours from the wound=
 of an intercostal=20

artery. Thus, too, a wound of the branches of the external carotid artery i=
s often enough to cause=20

death, and a wound in a=20
