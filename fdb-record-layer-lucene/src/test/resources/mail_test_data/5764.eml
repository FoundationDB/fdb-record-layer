his fine specimen was in excellent condition, although the miserable pastur=

tinct.  Lothair would have sprung forward, _
fresh mimosa bark well bruised, with water, is rubbed in by the friction. A=
bout four days are=20

sufficient to tan the thin skin of a gazelle, which is much valued for its =
toughness and durability; the=20

aperture at the hind quarters is sewn together, and the opening of the neck=
 is closed, when=20

required, by tying. A good water-skin should be porous, to allow the water =
to exude sufficiently to=20

moisten the exterior: thus the action of the air upon the exposed surface c=
auses evaporation, and=20

imparts to the water within the skin a delicious coolness. The Arabs usuall=
y prepare their tanned=20

skins with an empyreumatical oil made from a variety of substances, the bes=
t of which is that from=20

the sesame grain; this has a powerful smell, and renders the water so disag=
reeable that few=20

Europeans could drink it. This oil is black, and much resembles tar in appe=
arance; it has the effect=20

of preserving the leather, and of rendering it perfectly water-tight. In de=
sert travelling each person=20

should have his own private water-skin slung upon his dromedary; for this p=
urpose none are so=20

good as a small-sized gazelle skin that will contain about two gallons.  On=
 the 23d June we were=20

nearly suffocated by a whirlwind that buried everything within the tents se=
veral inches in dust; the=20

heat was intense; as usual the sky was spotless, but the simoom was more ov=
erpowering than I=20

had yet experienced. I accordingly took my rifle and went down to the pool,=
 as any movement,=20

even in the burning sun, was preferable to inaction in that sultry heat and=
 dust. The crocodiles had=20

dragged the skeletons of the hippopotami into the water; several huge heads=
 appeared and then=20

vanished from the surface, and the ribs of the carcase that projected, trem=
bled and jerked as the=20

jaws of the crocodiles were at work beneath. I shot one of very large size =
through the head, but it=20

sank to the bottom; I expected to find it on the following morning floating=
 upon the surface when=20

the gas should have distended the body.  I also shot a large single bull hi=
ppopotamus late in the=20

evening, which was alone at the extremity of the pool; he sank at the foreh=
ead shot, and, as he=20

never rose again, I concluded that he was dead, and that I should find him =
on the morrow with the=20

crocodile. Tired with as any knight in fairy-tale whom malignant influences=
 had robbed of his valor=20

and will and virtue. No sane person could credit, even comprehend, his posi=
tion. Had he the=20

opportunity of stating it in a court of justice to-morrow, he could only en=
ter into a narrative which=20

would decide his lot as an insane being. The magical rites had been so grad=
ual, so subtle, so=20

multifarious, all in appearance independent of each other, though in realit=
y scientifically combined,=20

that, while the conspirators had probably effected his ruin both in body an=
d in soul, the only=20

charges he could make against them would be acts of exquisite charity, tend=
erness, self-sacrifice,=20

personal devotion, refined piety, and religious sentiment of the most exalt=
ed character.  What was=20

to be done? And could any thing be done? Could he escape? Where from and wh=
ere to? He was=20

certain, and had been for some time, from many circumstances, that he was w=
atched. Could he=20

hope that the vigilance which observed all his movements would scruple to p=
revent any which=20

might be inconvenient? He felt assured that, to quit that palace alone, was=
 not in his power. And=20

were it, whither could he go? To whom was he to appeal? And about what was =
he to appeal?=20

Should he appeal to the Holy Father? There would be an opportunity for that=
 to-morrow. To the=20

College of Cardinals, who had solemnized yesterday with gracious unction hi=
s spiritual triumph?=20

To those congenial spirits, the mild Assessor of the Inquisition, or the pr=
esident of the=20

Propaganda, who was busied at that moment in circulating throughout both th=
e Americas, all Asia,=20

all Africa, all Australia, and parts of Europe, for the edification of dist=
ant millions, the particulars of=20

the miraculous scene in which he was the principal actor? Should he throw h=
imself on the=20



protection of the ambiguous minister of the British crown, and invoke his a=
id against a conspiracy=20

touching the rights, reason, and freedom of one of her majesty=E2=80=99s su=
bjects? He would probably find=20

that functionary inditing a private letter to the English Secretary of Stat=
e, giving the minister a=20

graphic account of the rare doings of yesterday, and assuring the minister,=
 from his own personal=20

and ocular experience, that a member of one of the highest orders of the=20


_
and fatiguing sand of the river's bed.  The cool night arrived, and at abou=
t half-past eight I was=20

lying half asleep upon my bed by the margin of the river, when I fancied th=
at I heard a rumbling=20

like distant thunder: I had not heard such a sound for months, but a low un=
interrupted roll=20

appeared procession a lighted taper after two angels with amaranthine flowe=
rs and golden wings.=20

Lothair remained in his apartments; no one approached him. It was the only =
day that the=20

monsignore had not waited on him. Father Coleman was equally reserved. Stra=
nge to say, not one=20

of those agreeable and=20


_
I raised my head to listen more attentively when a confusion of voices aros=
e from the Arabs' camp,=20

with a sound of many feet, and in a few minutes they rushed into my camp, s=
houting to my men in=20

the darkness, "El Bahr! El Bahr!" (the river! the river!)  We were up in an=
 instant, and my=20

interpreter, Mahomet, in a state of intense confusion, explained that the r=
iver was coming down,=20

and that the supposed distant thunder was the roar of approaching water.  M=
any of the gentlemen,=20

fathers of the oratory, who talked about gems, torsos, and excavations, and=
 who always more or=20

less attended his levee, troubled him this morning. With that exquisite tac=
t which pervades the=20

hierarchical circles of Rome, every one felt that Lothair, on the eve of th=
at event of his life which=20

Providence had so long and so mysteriously prepared, would wish to be undis=
turbed.  Restless,=20

disquieted, revolving all the incidents of his last year, trying, by=20


_
bed; these were quickly awakened by the Arabs, who rushed down the steep ba=
nk to save the=20

skulls of my two hippopotami that were exposed to dry. Hardly had they desc=
ended, when the=20

sound of the river in the darkness beneath told us that the water had arriv=
ed, and the men,=20

dripping with wet, had just sufficient time to drag their heavy burdens up =
the bank.  All was=20

darkness and confusion; everybody was talking and no one listening; but the=
 great event had=20

occurred the river had arrived "like a thief in the night." On the morning =
of the 24th June, I stood on=20

the banks of the noble Atbara river, at the break of day. The wonder of the=
 desert!--yesterday=20

there was a barren sheet of glaring sand, with a fringe of withered bush an=
d trees upon its=20

borders, that cut the yellow expanse of desert. For days we had journeyed a=
long the exhausted=20

bed: all Nature, even in Nature's poverty, was most poor: no bush could boa=
st a leaf: no tree could=20

throw a shade: crisp gums crackled upon the stems of the mimosas, the sap d=
ried upon the burst=20

bark, sprung with the withering heat of the simoom. In one night there was =
a mysterious change--

wonders of the mighty Nile!--an army of water was hastening to the wasted r=
iver: there was no=20

drop of rain, no thunder-cloud on the horizon to give hope, all had been dr=
y and sultry; dust and=20

desolation yesterday, to-day a magnificent stream, some 500 yards in width =
and from fifteen to=20

twenty feet in depth, flowed through the dreary desert! Bamboos and reeds, =
with trash of all kinds,=20

were hurried along the muddy waters. Where were all the crowded inhabitants=
 of the pool? The=20

prison doors were broken, the prisoners were released, and rejoiced in the =
mighty stream of the=20

Atbara.  The into such a false position, and how he could yet possibly extr=
icate himself from it, not=20

shrinking in many things from self-blame, and yet not recognizing on his pa=
rt such a degree of=20

deviation from the standard of right feeling, or even of commonsense, as wo=
uld authorize such an=20

overthrow as that awaiting him=E2=80=94high rank and boundless wealth, a st=
ation of duty and of honor,=20

some gifts of Nature, and golden youth, and a disposition that at least asp=
ired, in the employment=20

of these, accidents of life and fortune, at something better than selfish g=
ratification, all=20

smashed=E2=80=94the day drew on.  Drew on the day, and every hour it seemed=
 his spirit was more lone=20

and dark. For the first time the thought of death occurred to him as a reli=
ef from the perplexities of=20

existence. How much better had he died at Mentana! To this pass had arrived=
 the cordial and=20

brilliant Lord of Muriel, who enjoyed and adorned life, and wished others t=
o adorn and to enjoy it;=20

the individual whom, probably, were the majority of the English people poll=
ed, they would have=20

fixed upon as filling the most enviable of all positions, and holding out a=
 hope that he was not=20

unworthy of it. Born with every advantage that could command the sympathies=
 of his fellow-men,=20

with a quick intelligence and a noble disposition, here he was at one-and-t=
wenty ready to welcome=20

death, perhaps even to devise it, as the only rescue from a doom of confusi=
on, degradation, and=20

remorse.  He had thrown himself on a sofa, and had buried his face in his h=
ands to assist the=20

abstraction which he demanded. There was not an incident of his life that e=
scaped the painful=20

inquisition of his memory. He passed his childhood once more in that stern =
Scotch home, that,=20

after=20


_
actually the beginning of my work, I felt that by the experience of this ni=
ght I had obtained a clue to=20

one portion of the Nile mystery, and that, as "coming events cast their sha=
dows before them," this=20

sudden creation of a river was but the shadow of the great cause.  The rain=
s were pouring in=20

Abyssinia! these were sources of the Nile!  One of my Turks, Hadji Achmet, =
was ill; therefore,=20

although I longed to travel, it was necessary to wait. I extract verbatim f=
rom my journal, 26th June:-

-"The river has still risen; the weather is cooler, and the withered trees =
and bushes are giving=20

signs of been so kind, and, as it would seem, so wise. The last words of co=
unsel and of warning=20

from his uncle, expressed at Muriel, came back to him. And yet there seemed=
 a destiny throughout=20

these transactions which was; irresistible! The last words of Theodora, her=
 look, even more=20

solemn than her tone, might have been breathed over a tripod, for they were=
 a prophecy, not a=20

warning.  How long he had been absorbed in this passionate reverie he knew =
not but when he=20

looked up again it was night, and the moon had touched his window. He rose =
and walked up and=20

down the room, and then went into the corridor. All=20


_
of this country. The frightful simoom of April, May, and June, burns everyt=
hing as though parched=20

by fire, and not even a withered leaf hangs to a bough, but the trees wear =
a wintry appearance in=20

the midst of intense heat. The wild geese have paired, the birds are buildi=
ng their nests, and,=20

although not even a drop of dew has fallen, all Nature seems to be aware of=
 an approaching=20

change, as the south wind blowing cool from the wet quarter is the harbinge=
r of rain. Already some=20

of the mimosas begin to afford a shade, under which the gazelles may be sur=
ely found at mid-day;=20

the does are now in fawn, and the young will be dropped when this now withe=
red land shall be=20

green with herbage.  "Busy, packing for a start to-morrow; I send Hadji Vel=
li back to Berber in=20

charge of the two hippos' heads to the care of the good old Halleem Effendi=
. No time for shooting=20

to-day. I took out all the hippos' teeth, of which he possesses 40, 10--10,=
=20

------                                              10--10 six tusks and fo=
urteen molars in each jaw. The bones of=20

the hippopotamus, like those of the elephant, are solid, and without marrow=
."   CHAPTER III.=20

WILD ASSES OF THE DESERT.  THE journey along the margin of the Atbara was s=
imilar to the=20

entire route from Berber, a vast desert, with the narrow band of trees that=
 marked the course of=20

the river; the only change was the magical growth of the leaves, which burs=
t hourly from the=20

swollen buds of the mimosas: this could be accounted for by the sudden arri=
val of the river, as the=20

water percolated clear and starry, and the moonlight fell on the tall, stil=
l cypresses in the vast=20

quadrangle.  Lothair leaned over the balustrade and gazed upon the moonlit =
fountains. The=20

change of scene, silent and yet not voiceless, and the softening spell of t=
he tranquillizing hour,=20

were a relief to him. And after a time he wandered about the corridors, and=
 after a time he=20

descended into the court. The tall Swiss, in his grand uniform, was closing=
 the gates which had=20

just released a visitor. Lothair motioned that he too wished to go forth, a=
nd the Swiss obeyed him.=20

The threshold was passed, and Lothair found himself for the first time alon=
e in Rome.  Utterly=20

reckless, he cared not where he went or what might happen. The streets were=
 quite deserted, and=20

he wandered about with a strange curiosity, gratified as he sometimes encou=
ntered famous=20

objects he had read of, and yet the true character of which no reading ever=
 realizes.  The=20

moonlight becomes the proud palaces of Rome, their corniced and balconied f=
ronts rich with deep=20

shadows in the blaze. Sometimes he encountered an imperial column; sometime=
s he came to an=20

arcadian square flooded with light and resonant with the fall of statued fo=
untains. Emerging from a=20

long, straggling street of convents and gardens, he found himself in an ope=
n space full of antique=20

ruins, and among them the form of a colossal amphitheatre that he at once r=
ecognized.  It rose=20

with its three tiers of arches and the huge wall that crowns them, black an=
d complete in the air;=20

and not until Lothair had entered it could he perceive the portion of the o=
uter wall=20


_
through the sand and nourished the famishing roots.  The tracks of wild ass=
es had been frequent,=20

but hitherto I had not seen the animals, as their drinking-hour was at nigh=
t, after which they=20

travelled far into the desert: however, on the morning of the 29th June, sh=
ortly after the start at=20

about 6 A.M., we perceived three of these beautiful creatures on our left--=
an ass, a female, and a=20

foal. They were about half a mile distant when first observed, and upon our=
 approach to within half=20

that distance they halted and faced about; they were evidently on their ret=
urn to the desert from=20

the river. Those who have seen donkeys in their civilized state have no con=
ception of the beauty of=20

the wild and original animal. Far from the passive and subdued appearance o=
f the English ass, the=20

animal in its native desert is the perfection of activity and courage; ther=
e is a high-bred tone in the=20

deportment, a high-actioned step when it trots freely over the rocks and sa=
nd, with the speed of a=20

horse when it gallops over the boundless desert. No animal is more difficul=
t of approach; and,=20

although they are frequently captured by the Arabs, those taken are invaria=
bly the foals, which are=20

ridden and now bathed with the silver light. Lothair was alone. In that hug=
e creation, once echoing=20

with the shouts, and even the agonies, of thousands, Lothair was alone.  He=
 sat him down on a=20

block of stone in that sublime and desolate arena, and asked himself the se=
cret spell of this Rome=20

that had already so agitated his young life, and probably was about critica=
lly to affect it. Theodora=20

lived for Rome and died for Rome. And the cardinal, born and bred an Englis=
h gentleman, with=20

many hopes and honors, had renounced his religion, and, it might be said, h=
is country, for Rome.=20

And for Rome, to-morrow, Catesby would die without a pang, and sacrifice hi=
mself for Rome, as=20

his race for three hundred years had given, for the same cause, honor and b=
road estates and=20

unhesitating lives. And these very people were influenced by different moti=
ves, and thought they=20

were devoting themselves to opposite ends. But still it was Rome=E2=80=94re=
publican or Caesarian, papal=20

or pagan, it still was Rome.  Was it a breeze in a breezeless night that wa=
s sighing amid these=20

ruins? A pine-tree moved its head on a broken arch, and there was a stir am=
ong the plants that=20

hung on the ancient walls. It was a breeze in a=20


_
the wild ass is a reddish cream tinged with the shade most prevalent of the=
 ground that it inhabits;=20

thus it much resembles the sand of the desert. I wished to obtain a specime=
n, and accordingly I=20

exerted my utmost knowledge of stalking to obtain a shot at the male. After=
 at least an hour and a=20

half I succeeded in obtaining a long shot with a single rifle, which passed=
 through the shoulder,=20

and I secured my first and last donkey. It was with extreme regret that I s=
aw my beautiful prize in=20

the last breezeless night that was sighing amid the ruins.  There was a tal=
l crag of ancient building=20

contiguous to the block on which Lothair was seated, and which on his arriv=
al he had noted,=20

although, long lost in reverie, he had not recently turned his glance in th=
at direction. He was=20

roused from that reverie by the indefinite sense of some change having occu=
rred which often=20

disturbs and terminates one=E2=80=99s brooding thoughts. And looking round,=
 he felt, he saw, he was no=20

longer alone. The moonbeams fell=20
