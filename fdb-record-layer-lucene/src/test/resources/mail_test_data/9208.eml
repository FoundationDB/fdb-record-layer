philodendron monstera appear decidedly unattractive to me. From all I can l=
earn, the political situation in the State is handled as a purely business =
proposition; it is a matter of bargain and sale. I couldn't go into anythin=
g like that and keep my self-respect."  "No, of course you couldn't, son. S=
o you just took a job where you could earn good, clean money in your profes=
sion. I don't blame you a particle."  Blount was vaguely perturbed, and he =
showed it by absently laying aside  "Where in the world is Felix?" cried Mr=
s. Blossom; for the Milesian, actually dreading the onslaught of the excell=
ent woman who was not his mother, had dodged in at the door of the boudoir.=
  "I'm looking for you, grandma," said he, stepping out on the deck.  As so=
on as she saw him, she spread out her arms and rushed upon him; but Felix p=
ut up his left arm and warded off the burden of the attack, taking her by t=
he hand with the right.  "How glad I am to see philodendron monstera appear=
 decidedly unattractive to me. From all I can learn, the political situatio=
n in the State is handled as a purely business proposition; it is a matter =
of bargain and sale. I couldn't go into anything like that and keep my self=
-respect."  "No, of course you couldn't, son. So you just took a job where =

, actually dreading the onslaught of the excellent woman who was not his mo=
ther, had dodged in at the door of the boudoir.  "I'm looking for you, gran=
dma," said he, stepping out on the deck.  As soon as she saw him, she sprea=
d out her arms and rushed upon him; but Felix put up his left arm and warde=
d off the burden of the attack, taking her by the hand with the right.  "Ho=
w glad I am to see _
that there would be a place at their table for him--and another for his fat=
her, if the ex-senator would=20

so far honor a poor college professor. There was an hour to spare; and if t=
he vice-president of the=20

Transcontinental was not the king, he was at least a great man, and one who=
se invitation was in=20

some sense a royal command.  "Certainly, I'll be glad to go with you," was =
Blount's acquiescent=20

rejoinder. So much the registry-clerk heard; and he saw, between jabs with =
his pen, the straight=20

path to the revolving doors of the portal ploughed by the big man with youn=
g Blount at his elbow.=20

One minute after the spinning doors had engulfed the pair the registry-cler=
k was called on the=20

house telephone. A sad-faced tourist who was waiting patiently for his room=
 assignment heard=20

only the answer to the question which came over the wire from one of the up=
per floors: "No,=20

Senator, Mr. Evan is not here; he has just this moment gone out--with Mr. M=
cVickar. Could I=20

overtake him? I'll try; but I don't know where they were going. Yes; all ri=
ght. I'll send a boy right=20

away."     VIII  THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT   When the news went forth to the dwell=
ers in the sage-

brush hills that Boss David's son had been appointed to fill an important o=
ffice as a member of the=20

railroad company's legal staff, the first wave of astoundment was swiftly f=
ollowed by many=20

speculations as to what young Blount's _debut_ as a railroad placeman reall=
y meant.  _The=20

Plainsman_, the capital city's principal daily, and the outspoken organ of =
the people's party, was=20

quick to discover an ulterior motive in Evan Blount's appointment and its a=
cceptance. Blenkinsop,=20

the leader-writer on _The Plainsman_, took a half-column in which to point =
out in emphatic and=20

vigorous Western phrase the dangers that threatened the commonwealth in thi=
s very evident=20

coalition of the railroad octopus and the machine.  The _Lost River Miner_,=
 on the contrary, was=20

unwilling to believe that the younger Blount was acting in the interest of =
machine politics in taking=20

an employee's place on the railroad pay-roll. In this editor's comment ther=
e were veiled hints of a=20

disagreement between father and son; of differences of opinion which might,=
 later on, lead to a=20

pitched battle. The _Capital Daily_, however--the stock in which was said t=
o be owned or=20

controlled by local railroad officials--took a different ground, covertly i=
nsinuating that nothing for=20

nothing was the accepted rule in politics; that if the railroad company had=
 made a place for the=20

son, it was only a justifiable deduction that the father was not as fiercel=
y inimical to the railroad=20

interests as the opposition press was willing to have a too credulous publi=
c believe.  Elsewhere in=20

the State press comment was divided, as the moulders of public opinion happ=
ened to read party=20

loss or gain in the appointment of the new legal department head. Some were=
 fair enough to say=20

that young Blount had merely shown good sense in taking the first job that =
was offered him,=20

following the commendation with the very obvious conclusion that the railro=
ad company's pay=20

check would buy just as much bread in the open market as anybody's else. On=
 the whole, the=20

senator's son was given the benefit of the doubt and a chance to prove up. =
 Of the interview=20

between the father and the son, in which Evan announced his intention of ac=
cepting a place under=20

McVickar, nothing was said in the newspapers, for the very good reason that=
 no reporter was=20

present. If the young man who had so summarily taken his future into his ow=
n hands was=20

anticipating a storm of disapproval and opposition, he was disappointed. He=
 had seen Mr.=20

McVickar's private car coupled to the east-bound Fast Mail, and had dined w=
ith Patricia and her=20

father, the fourth seat at the table of reunion being vacant because the se=
nator was dining=20

elsewhere. Later in the evening he faced the music in the sitting-room of t=
he private suite,=20

waylaying his father on the Honorable David's return to the hotel.  Plannin=
g it out beforehand,=20



Blount had meant to give the ethical knocked a hole in her so easily," said=
 Louis.  "It has been=20

repeated over and over again that the Maud was constructed of extra strengt=
h when she was built.=20

Who was that man of whom she was purchased?"  "Giles Chickworth, a Scotchma=
n," replied=20

Louis, as he recalled the character.  "He declared that she was the stronge=
st little vessel of her=20

size that ever was built. Don examined the inside of her bow immediately af=
ter the blow was=20

struck, and I have done so since. She has not started a plate or a bolt. Bu=
t then we had all the=20

advantage. We struck the pirate fairly on the broadside with the part of ou=
r craft where she is the=20

strongest, and where there could be no give or spring. It does not seem so =
strange to me as I think=20

it over."  "Pitts," called the captain a little later, while they were stil=
l watching the approach of the=20

ship, "how is your patient?"  "About the same, sir; I don't see any change =
in him," replied the cook.=20

"But he will have the doctor to-night, and that will put him in the way of =
getting well."  "Does he talk=20

any?"  "He would talk all the time if I would let him; but I don't answer h=
im when he asks questions,=20

and I leave him alone most of the time."  "What is the condition of the gal=
ley?" asked the captain.=20

"It is in very bad condition, sir; the cannon-ball tore away all the shelve=
s on the starboard side, and=20

knocked the tins and dishes all to pieces. But I can get supper after a fas=
hion," replied the cook.=20

"You may let the supper go to-night, and we will get it on board of the shi=
p. We shall be alongside=20

of her in less than fifteen minutes," said the captain. "Set the colors ast=
ern, Flix."  The Maud was=20

going at full speed, and, as the two steamers were approaching each other, =
they came within hail=20

off Cape Arnauti. At this time the captain ordered three cheers to be given=
; for he wished to make=20

a demonstration of some kind, and this was the only way within his means. T=
hey were given with=20

hearty good-will, and the seamen responded from the Guardian-Mother, and bo=
th vessels whistled=20

as snappers. Then the ship stopped her screw, and the sound of escaping ste=
am came from her.=20

"Maud, ahoy!" shouted Captain Ringgold from her top-gallant forecastle.  "O=
n board the Guardian-

Mother!" responded Captain Scott.  "Come alongside!" added the commander.  =
"Alongside, sir!"=20

replied the captain.  The Maud made a sweep around, and when she had come a=
bout, she came=20

alongside on the port side of the ship. The gangway was already lowered. Al=
l the cabin party had=20

been watching the approach to the island from the promenade; but as soon as=
 the Maud came=20

alongside, they all hastened to the main deck to greet the young cruisers, =
who had been absent=20

from the ship about thirty hours.  "Come on board, all of you!" called the =
commander from the=20

head of the gangway.  "I think we had better not say anything about what ha=
s happened in the=20

presence of the party," said Scott, as he started to mount the steps.  "Not=
 a word," added Louis;=20

and Morris and Felix repeated the words.  The "Big Four" ascended the gangw=
ay stairs to the=20

main deck. The captain was permitted to pass without any assaulting embrace=
s, but Louis=20

dropped lovingly and submissively into the arms of his mother, as did Morri=
s when Mrs. Woolridge=20

presented herself. Felix hung back, for he knew what awaited him. The comma=
nder stepped aside=20

to make room for these demonstrations.  "Come to my room, all of you, as so=
on as the others are=20

at liberty," said the commander in a low tone to Captain Scott.  "I will, s=
ir," replied he, fully=20

understanding what was meant.  "I am so glad to see you again, Louis!" excl=
aimed Mrs. Belgrave,=20

as she continued to hug her boy. "You have had a terrible time, haven't you=
, my dear?"  "What=20

makes you think so, mother?" asked Louis, wondering what she meant; for it =
seemed impossible=20

that she could know anything about the "Battle of Khrysoko," as it afterwar=
ds came to be called.=20

"Why, you were out in a terrible storm last night," replied Mrs. Belgrave. =
"I was afraid you would be=20



cast away, my=20


_
which had constrained him to put a conclusive end to the attorney-generalsh=
ip scheme. But when=20

the crux came, the carefully planned argument side-stepped and he was reduc=
ed to the necessity=20

of declaring his purpose baldly. The railroad people had offered him a plac=
e, and he had accepted=20

it.  "So McVickar talked you over to his side, did he?" was the boss's gent=
le comment. "It's all right,=20

son; you're a man grown, and I reckon you know best what you want to you ha=
lf the night."  "Then=20

your prayers were effectual, for I am safe," answered Louis with a smile.  =
"But wasn't it an awful=20

tempest, my boy?" she asked, hugging the young man with a new impulse.  "No=
t at all, my dear=20

mother. We had a gale of wind, and it made a rough night of it; but we got =
into this bay about eight=20

o'clock this morning all right," returned Louis, reciprocating her caresses=
. "But you must not worry=20

so about me, mother. We were in no=20


_
political creek, we won't let that roil the water any more than it has to, =
will we?"  To such a mild-

mannered surrender, or apparent surrender, the stirring filial emotions cou=
ld do no less than to=20

respond heartily.  "We mustn't let it," was the quick reply; but after this=
 the younger man added: "I=20

feel that I ought to make some explanations--they're due to you. I've been =
knocking about here in=20

the city with my eyes and ears open, and I must gale or the heavy sea."  "H=
ere is the commander,=20

and he wants to see you, I know," she said, stepping aside for him.  Captai=
n Ringgold took the=20

hand of the owner of the ship, and pressed it warmly.  [Illustration: "SHE =
SPREAD OUT HER=20

ARMS AND RUSHED UPON HIM." Page 147.]  "He says he has been in no danger fr=
om the=20

storm, Captain," added the lady.  "He knows best about that; but I told you=
 the Maud would go=20

through it all right," added the=20
