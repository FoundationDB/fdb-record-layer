popular member of Ridgley School would be interested in visiting the humble Holbrook home. He 

was even a little ashamed that Dad Holbrook had extended the invitation with so much genial 

assurance.  "I'll be mighty glad to come--if Teeny-bits wants me to," said Durant, and Teeny-bits 

looked at him with such a queer expression of surprise and pleasure that Neil added: "You didn't 

expect me to refuse an invitation like that, did you?"  At the steps of the locker building Durant left 

them, and Teeny-bits remained outside for a few minutes to talk to the station master. Then he 

said good-by and went inside to take his shower.  He found his team-mates discussing the game 

in detail and bestowing praise on Neil Durant.  "Well, cap'n, old scout," Ned Stillson was saying, as 

Teeny-bits came clamping in, "you sure were Johnny-on-the-spot."  Though there was nothing in 

the words to signify actual liberties; while his companions support him by their silent but dignified 

presence, and the venerable Franklin, in particular, imposes new obligations on his country's 

gratitude.  The figures are as large as the life; and it may safely be said, that the world never 

beheld, on a similar occasion, a more noble assemblage. It was the native and unchartered 

nobility of great talent, cultivated intelligence, superior manners, high moral aim, and devoted 

patriotism. The crisis demanded the utmost firmness of which the human mind is capable--a 

firmness not produced, for the moment, by passion and enthusiasm, but resting on the most able 

comprehension of both duties and dangers, and on a _principled_ determination to combat the 

one and to fulfil the other.  This moral effect has been produced in the fullest and finest manner by 

this great painter; and no true American can contemplate this

one, Teeny-bits felt that the real meaning behind them was that when some one else had failed, 

Durant had saved the day. That some one else was himself, and, though the members of the team 

treated him as cordially as ever, he had the unpleasant feeling that they looked upon him now as 

one who had failed in a crisis, and he had to admit to himself that their opinion--if they held it--was 

justly founded. He went back to his room and for half an hour before supper sat by his window, 

thinking deeply. The conclusion to which he came was this: if he ever got another chance to run 

with the ball his liberties, and to the artist who has commemorated the event, and transmitted the 

very features and persons of the actors to posterity. Such efforts of the pencil tend powerfully also 

to invigorate patriotism, and to prompt the rising generation to emulate such glorious examples. 

The composition and execution in this picture are in a masterly style. The grouping of so many full 

length portraits, in a scene in which there could scarcely be any action, and in such a manner as 

to dispose of them without monotony, was an attainment of no small difficulty. The painter could 

not even avail
