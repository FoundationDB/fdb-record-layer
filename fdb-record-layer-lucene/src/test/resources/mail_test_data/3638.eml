"I've seen pictures of it. And while our bungalow is on one side of the mountain torrent there is

commented Bess.  "Is that other bungalow within sight or calling distance of ours?" asked Belle. 

"One or the other, yes," assented Cora. "But why so anxious?"  "Because when those ghosts, or 

whatever they are, get to moving things about I want a man, or at least a good-sized boy around,"

you funny girl! Why will you persist in calling them ghosts?"  "Well, aren't they? Moving chairs 

about?"  "Is that what happened--or happens?" asked Bess.  "So I understand," returned Cora.
