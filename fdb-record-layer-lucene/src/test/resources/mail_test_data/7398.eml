dracaena marginata sinking.  Captain Coffin at once ordered the men to get =
into our boat with their implements, and taking the smashed boat in tow, we=
 returned to our own whale, which appeared to be fast dying.  The captain, =
after securing the end of the severed whale-line, attached it to the line i=
n the third officer's boat, and then told me to get into the stoven boat, a=

he left Farll's. Nobody might find it out for quite a long time, and then t=
here might be confusion in the public mind, followed by a sharp fall in pri=
ces. And the beauty of it is that the public wouldn't really be any the wor=
se. Because an imitation that no one can distinguish from the original is n=
aturally as good as the original. You take me? There's certainly a tremendo=

thrown overboard.  They threw me a bight of rope from the ship, and I clamb=
ered back on deck.=20

Captain Coffin told me to go below and change my dripping clothes, and then=
 I could go in the=20

boat with him and pull the after oar. You may lay to it that I flew down th=
ose cabin stairs, for if=20

there was anything in the world I longed for, it was to get a chance to see=
 a sperm-whale killed.=20

As Captain Coffin stepped to the bow of the boat he ordered the black stewa=
rd to his place at the=20

steering-oar. "Don't be afraid to lay me right on to them, steward," said h=
e. "Nothing but wood and=20

black skin will suit me to-day!"  We soon caught up with the other boat. Th=
e first and second=20

officers had each killed a whale, and were then engaged in buoying a tub, w=
ith the _Nimrod's_=20

name stamped strange and sinister race! They looked as though in the final =
stages of decay, and=20

wherever their heads might rest was stretched a white cloth, so that their =
heads might not touch=20

the spots sanctified by the heads of the mighty departed. They rarely spoke=
 to one another, but=20

exchanged regards of mutual distrust and scorn; and if by chance they did c=
onverse it was in=20

tones of weary, brusque disillusion. They could at best descry each other b=
ut indistinctly in the=20

universal pervading gloom--a gloom upon which electric lamps, shining dimly=
 yellow in their vast=20

lustres, produced almost no impression. The whole establishment was buried =
in the past,=20

dreaming of its Titantic yore, when there were doubtless giants who could f=
ill those fauteuils and=20

stick their feet on those=20


_
carcasses. The rest of the school had gone down, and the third and fourth o=
fficers' crews were=20

resting on their oars, waiting for the attacked whales to break water again=
.  The other ships now=20

had their boats in the water, and as Captain Coffin saw them approach he ca=
lled to his officers:=20

"Don't let the Nantucketers beat us! They are regular sharks after sperm-oi=
l, but we have four=20

whales the best of them now. Every man here must strike his fish to-day."  =
He had hardly finished=20

his speech when, right beside our boat, an old bull whale showed his nose o=
ut of the water and=20

sent a blast of hot air out of his spout-holes, which was blown back to us =
by the wind.  As we felt=20

the warm breath on our faces, each man checked his oar. And right here, chi=
ldren, I want to=20

correct a mistaken idea. Whales don't spout water. It is their hot breath w=
hich, like the breath from=20

a horse's nostrils in winter, shows white against the sky and looks like wa=
ter.  The body of the=20

whale which had broken water beside us bore many a scar, and his back was a=
ll covered with=20

barnacles.  "Now, boys, give way to your oars, and you, steward, lay me  It=
 was in such an=20

environment that Mr. Oxford gave Priam to eat and to drink off little ordin=
ary plates and out of tiny=20

tumblers. No hint of the club's immemorial history in that excessively mode=
rn and excellent repast-

-save in the Stilton cheese, which seemed to have descended from the fine f=
ruity days of some=20

Homeric age, a cheese that Ulysses might have inaugurated. I need hardly sa=
y that the total effect=20

on Priam's temperament was disastrous. (Yet how could the diplomatic Mr. Ox=
ford have guessed=20

that Priam had never been in a club before?) It induced in him a speechless=
 anguish, and he=20

would have paid a sum as gigantic as the club--he would have paid the very =
cheque in his pocket--

never to have met Mr. Oxford. He was a far too sensitive man for a club, an=
d his moods were=20

incalculable. Assuredly Mr. Oxford had miscalculated the result of his club=
 on Priam's humour; he=20

soon saw his error.  "Suppose we take coffee in the smoking-room?" he said.=
  The populous=20

smoking-room was the one part of the club where talking with a natural loud=
ness was not a crime.=20

Mr. Oxford found a corner fairly free from midgets, and they=20


_
on to him!" spoke Captain Coffin, and as each man gave a steady pull stewar=
d, with a skilful turn=20

of the steering oar, brought the head of the boat round, and the next insta=
nt her bow brought up=20

against the body of the whale. Captain Coffin's wish was fulfilled, for, in=
 whalemen's lore, we were=20

"wood and black skin."  Instantly he plunged his harpoon into the monster's=
 quivering blubber, and=20

with a dexterity that was wonderful in a man of his size, he seized another=
 and thrust it to the hilt=20

beside the first.  "Stern all! stern all!" he cried, and, as we backed away=
 from the maddened whale,=20

it turned and, with one sweep of its flukes, sent a cataract of water over =
us that almost filled the=20

boat, and drenched us to the skin. It dived, then, and the whale line ran o=
ut of its tub so rapidly=20

that the loggerhead in the stern, around which was a turn of the line, smok=
ed like a chimney.=20

"Pour some water on that line!" cried the steward to the tub oarsman. And a=
s the man obeyed, the=20

steward tightened the turn on the liqueurs and cigars accompanied the coffe=
e. You could actually=20

see midgets laughing outright in the mist of smoke; the chatter narrowly es=
caped being a din; and=20

at intervals a diminutive boy entered and bawled the name of a midget at th=
e top of his voice,=20

Priam was suddenly electrified, and Mr. Oxford, very alert, noticed the ele=
ctrification.  Mr. Oxford=20

drank his coffee somewhat quickly, and then he leaned forward a little over=
 the table, and put his=20

moon-like face nearer to Priam's, and arranged his legs in a truly comforta=
ble position beneath the=20

table, and expelled a large quantity of smoke from his cigar. It was clearl=
y the preliminary to a=20

scene of confidence, the approach to the crisis to which he had for several=
 hours been leading up.=20

Priam's heart trembled.  "What is your opinion, _maitre_," he asked, "of th=
e ultimate value of Farll's=20

pictures?"  Priam was in misery. Mr. Oxford's manner was deferential, amiab=
le and expectant. But=20

Priam did not know what to say. He only knew what he would do if he could=
=20


_
Soon the whale slackened his speed and rode to the surface, and in a few mo=
ments broke water=20

off our starboard bow. Then Captain Coffin ordered us to gather in the line=
 and pull him up beside=20

the whale, and at the same time he took a long lance from its socket and ha=
ving braced himself=20

firmly recklessly, unceremoniously, out of that club.  "I--I don't know," s=
aid Priam, visibly whitening.=20

"Because I've bought a goodish few Farlls in my time," Mr. Oxford continued=
, "and I must say I've=20

sold them well. I've only got that one left that I showed you this morning,=
 and I've been=20


_
ready.  What a moment of awe it was to me as I looked at the monster angril=
y lashing the water=20

with its fins and flukes! The next instant we were beside the whale, and as=
 it rolled on its side=20

Captain Coffin transfixed him with a thrust of his lance that seemed to pie=
rce his very vitals. The=20

next moment the blood poured in gallons from his spout-holes. Having slacke=
ned the line from the=20

boat, we rested on our oars at a safe distance and watched the monster circ=
ling around in its dying=20

fury.  During this time the rest of the boats had each secured another shou=
ld stick to it and wait for=20

a possible further rise, or sell it at once."  "How much can you sell it fo=
r?" Priam mumbled.  "I don't=20

mind telling you," said Mr. Oxford, "that I fancy I could sell it for a cou=
ple of thousand. It's rather=20

small, but it's one of the finest in existence."  "I should sell it," said =
Priam, scarcely audible.  "You=20

would? Well, perhaps you're right. It's a question, in my mind, whether som=
e other painter may not=20

turn up one of these days who would do that sort of thing even better than =
Farll did it. I could=20

imagine the possibility=20


_
signals of distress, and Captain Coffin ordered us to cut loose from our wh=
ale and go quickly to=20

their assistance.  We saw as we drew near them that the gunwale and the two=
 upper streaks of=20

their boat had been stove by their last whale, and the officer was about to=
 throw all the whaling=20

implements overboard, in order to lighten her, for the crew were desperatel=
y bailing out the water,=20

which was pouring well that only people like yourself, _maitre_, and perhap=
s me, could tell the=20

difference. It's just the kind of work that might be brilliantly imitated, =
if the imitator was clever=20

enough, don't you think?"  "But what do you mean?" asked Priam, perspiring =
in his back.  "Well,"=20

said Mr. Oxford vaguely, "one never knows. The style might be imitated, and=
 the market flooded=20

with canvases practically as good=20
