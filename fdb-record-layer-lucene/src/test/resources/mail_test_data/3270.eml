hat Ronald was in the habit of writing poems, verses, and things of that ki=
nd; and that they were greatly thought of by those who had seen them or to =
whom he had sent them.  'Why, I might have guessed as much,' she said to he=
rself, as she walked on alone to the _
stuff. But look you for my signet. See!" And he drew from his pocket a piec=
e of resin upon which=20

he had stamped his signet. "Keep that to prove the genuineness of my writte=
n orders. Is=20

everything satisfactory, Redfield?"  "Everything is satisfactory, Captain."=
  Captain Redfield was a=20

man of stalwart build. His height was six feet or all the various occupatio=
ns, and the concerts in the=20

evening, and the raffles in the smoking-room (this from hearsay); then the =
crowding on deck for=20

the first glimpse of the American coast-line; and the gliding over the shal=
lows of Sandy Hook; and=20

the friends who would come steaming down the Bay to wave handkerchiefs and =
welcome them=20


_
more, and his movements were quick and firm. His face was beardless and wor=
e an expression of=20

stability and energy.  The two stood for some time upon the prow of the shi=
p, and discussed the=20

locality of the proposed hiding of the precious booty. Then Captain Kidd ca=
lled two men by name,=20

who promptly responded. He said, "I have trusted you in times past, and I d=
esire to do so again. I=20

believe you will not betray my confidence. We are going to make another dep=
osit to-night. I have=20

long had the location in mind. Now, swear by the Holy Virgin that you will =
not disturb the stuff=20

yourselves, nor in any way aid or abet any one else in doing so."  They swo=
re with deep=20

earnestness.  The group continued there awhile, until the moon rose and she=
d its silver splendor=20

on the rolling water about them, touching the white-capped breakers with a =
soft and magic=20

radiance as they dashed upon the near-by beach.  Then orders were given for=
 the lowering of the=20

boat.  Captain Kidd proceeded to the lockers of the ship, which opened into=
 his cabin; and, with=20

the aid of Captain Redfield, drew forth two iron chests. These he carried t=
o the outer deck, and=20

carefully lowered them to the boats by means of ropes. From a respectful di=
stance the sailors who=20

had no hand in this work watched the proceedings with eager interest.  Fire=
arms, shovels, and=20

axes were then placed in the boat. Four rowers took their positions; and Ca=
ptains Kidd and=20

Redfield climbed down the rope ladder, and sat in the stern. Everything was=
 ready, and word was=20

given to ply the oars.  Soon the ship became a mystic shape in the dim dist=
ance; and, as the inlet=20

was entered, it was lost entirely to view. By tortuous passages among the m=
arshes, they drew up=20

at the island--Money Island.  "Island the fourth!" said Captain Kidd jocula=
rly. "Magnificent indeed=20

will be the buccaneer's castle in Merry England when they all give up their=
 wealth! Ha, a fine life=20

this; but I suppose as fine a one when the retired merchant from the South =
Seas brings his well-

earned fortune to a corner of old England. Not Captain Kidd then, men, but =
John So-and-So, a=20

wise and revered merchant. Ha! Do you see the game?"  The sailors sprang up=
on the land and=20

pulled the boat well in from the water. The officers stepped lightly ashore=
, and railed against the=20

low-lying branches, which whipped their faces. The trees were thick and low=
, making passage=20

beneath them arduous and slow. However, the whole island was small and soon=
 traversed; and,=20

finally, a spot was selected as being accessible and regard it as a quite n=
atural and simple thing=20

that he should be of this party; and that, after landing, her father should=
 take him about and 'see=20

him through,' as it were; and if her fancy failed to carry out these foreca=
sts, and to picture him=20

walking along Dearborn Avenue or driving out with them to Washington Park, =
it was that once or=20

twice ere now she had somehow arrived at the notion that Ronald Strang and =
Chicago would=20

prove to be incongruous.  Or was it some instinctive feeling that, however =
natural and fitting their=20

friendship might be in this remote little place in the Highlands, it might =
give rise to awkwardness=20

over there?  Anyhow, that could not prevent her father from seeing that Ron=
ald had ample=20

introductions and guidance when he landed at New York; and was not that the=
 proper sphere for=20

one of his years and courage and abilities?  When they got ashore at the en=
d of the day it was=20

found that each boat had got two more salmon, so that there was a display o=
f nine big fish on the=20

grass there in the gathering dusk.  'And to think that I should live to cat=
ch five salmon in one day,'=20

said Miss Carry, as she contemplated her share of the spoil.  'Well, no one=
 will believe it; for=20

they're just real mean people at home; and they won't allow that anything's=
 happened to you in=20

Europe unless you have something to show for it.  I suppose Ronald would gi=
ve me a written=20

guarantee.  Anyway, I am going to take that big one along to the Doctor--it=
 will be a good=20



introduction, won't it, pappa?'  But a curious thing happened about that sa=
me salmon. When they=20

got to the inn the fish were laid out on the stone flags of the dairy--the =
coolest and safest place for=20

them in the house; and Miss Carry, who had come along to see them, when she=
 wanted anything=20

done, naturally turned to Ronald.  'Ronald,' said she, 'I want to give that=
 big one to Mrs. Douglas,=20

and I am going along now to the cottage.  Will you carry it for me?'  He sa=
id something about=20

getting a piece of string and left.  A couple of minutes thereafter the lad=
 Johnnie appeared, with a=20

stout bit of cord in his hand; and he, having affixed that to the head and =
the tail of the salmon,=20

caught it up, and stood in readiness.  She seemed surprised.  'Where is Ron=
ald?' said she--for he=20

was always at her bidding.  'He asked me to carry the fish to the Doctor's =
house, mem,' said the=20

lad.  'Will I go now?'  Moreover, this salmon was accidentally responsible =
for a still further=20

discovery.  When Miss Carry went along to call on the Douglases, little Mag=
gie was=20


_
Two deep holes about ten feet apart were dug, and the chests brought and de=
posited within them.=20

Some of the earth was replaced; and then they sought two small trees to pla=
nt above the chests.=20

This was accomplished slowly and carefully, so that the growth of the trees=
 would not be together;=20

and when the little Maggie considered it fitting she should go home, Miss C=
arry said she would=20

accompany her--for it was now quite dark.  And they had a good deal of talk=
 by the way, partly=20

about schooling and accomplishments, but much more largely about Ronald, wh=
o was the=20
