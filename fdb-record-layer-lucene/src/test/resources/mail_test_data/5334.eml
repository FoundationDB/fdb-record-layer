philodendron monstera lord of Orleans should act as he had said he would, h=
is authority in the kingdom would have been very small indeed. It may there=
fore be presumed, it was for this that he was so eager to have my lord of O=
rleans put to death.  =E2=80=98O, Lord God! thou knowest how well he was in=
clined toward thee at the time of his being murdered, which gives me confid=
ence in his salvation; for the holy Scripture says, =E2=80=98Justus si mort=
e pr=C3=A6occupatus fuerit blood on the inner surface if there is a corresp=
onding wound of the body underneath. In simulated and imputed injuries the =
blood-stain may be on the outside of the clothing instead of on the inside,=
 showing that it was artificial and not natural. An impostor may either do =
too much or too little, and the medical witness should be on guard against =
both alternatives. Taylor[651] mentions a case which occurred in London som=
e time ago, philodendron monstera lord of Orleans should act as he had said=
 he would, his authority in the kingdom would have been very small indeed. =
It may therefore be presumed, it was for this that he was so eager to have =
my lord of Orleans put to death.  =E2=80=98O, Lord God! thou knowest how we=
ll he was inclined toward thee at the time of his being murdered, which giv=
es me confidence in his salvation; for the holy Scripture says, =E2=80=98Ju=
stus si morte pr=C3=A6occupatus fuerit blood on the inner surface if there =
is a corresponding wound of the body underneath. In simulated and imputed i=
njuries the blood-stain may be on the outside of the clothing instead of on=
 the inside, showing that it was artificial and not natural. An impostor ma=
y either do too much or too little, and the medical witness should be on gu=
ard against both alternatives. Taylor[651] mentions a case which occurred i=
n London some time ago, _
thou wilt then judge whether he has not been unjustly accused.  =E2=80=98Th=
e first charge brought against=20

the late duke of Orleans by the advocate of the duke of Burgundy is, That d=
uring his lifetime he=20

committed the crime of high treason in the highest degree, by his idolatrou=
s conduct in witchcrafts=20

and sorceries, contrary to the Christian faith and the honour of God. It is=
 true, that in regard to this=20

accusation, the advocate did not pursue it very far, saying, that the judgm=
ent of such crimes=20

belonged to God, the sovereign Lord,=E2=80=94meaning, that no human judge w=
as competent to it.  =E2=80=98When=20

making this charge, he spoke of an apostate monk and several sorcerers, in =
whom my late lord of=20

Orleans put confidence, according to his allegations. I shall scarcely offe=
r any reply to this=20

accusation, but, in like manner as he has done, refer the whole to the judg=
ment of God. It will be=20

sufficient for me to show, in the first place, That my late lord of Orleans=
 was a good and true=20

Christian; that he never committed any sorceries or idolatries, nor ever de=
parted from the faith of=20

JESUS CHRIST.  =E2=80=98I may likewise add, That from his youth upward, he =
was of a religious turn of=20

mind,=E2=80=94for, notwithstanding his fondness for amusements, his relianc=
e was in God, to whom he=20

very often confessed himself. Nay, the very Saturday preceding his death, h=
e had most devoutly=20

confessed himself, with many signs of contrition, declaring he would not lo=
nger of cases of=20

imputed but self-inflicted wounds are very superficial, often not below the=
 true skin. Being self-

inflicted they have many of the characters of suicidal wounds. Thus they ar=
e usually situated in=20

front and on the left or right according as the wounded person is right or =
left handed, and the=20

direction is usually similar to that in suicidal wounds. Such wounds are ge=
nerally incised or=20

punctured wounds, seldom contused wounds, and in this respect they resemble=
 suicidal wounds.=20

As exceptions to this rule, Bergeret[650] mentions some cases where females=
 in attacks of=20

hysteria have inflicted severe contusions on themselves, and have preferred=
 charges of attempted=20

murder against innocent persons. Like suicides also the hands are seldom in=
jured, though they=20

may be much so in resisting homicide.  In other respects, however, these wo=
unds differ from=20

suicidal wounds. Thus they are not usually situated over a =E2=80=9Cmortal=
=E2=80=9D spot, and they are often=20

numerous and _scattered_, sometimes parallel and sometimes not. The wounds =
in the dress do=20

not correspond even as often as in suicide. In comparing cuts in clothing w=
ith those on the body, it=20

is important to find what articles were worn at the time the assault was al=
leged to have taken=20

place, and to make sure that the clothes examined were those worn or allege=
d to have been worn.=20

It may not be necessary that the clothes examined should have been really w=
orn, for if they were=20


_
God, and to that of the public welfare. That I may not be suspected of utte=
ring falsehoods, many=20

religious as well as others, are now alive, to whom he had made such declar=
ations; and, without=20

saying more, let his uncle the duke of Bourbon be heard, who knows what pro=
mises he made to=20

God,=E2=80=94for a little before his decease, to have been worn and were no=
t, the examination of them=20

will almost always show the deception or the self-inflicted nature of the w=
ounds. Then take careful=20

note of the position, direction, form, and size of the cut and the apparent=
 sharpness of the weapon=20

in the several layers, and see if they correspond with one another=20


_
his conduct should be such as to merit the approbation of God and mankind, =
and that all the=20

inhabitants of this kingdom should be bound to pray for him.  =E2=80=98I kn=
ow not if our adversary had=20

heard of these wise declarations, or whether he was afraid of their being e=
ffected, as they were=20

quite in opposition to his wish for the on the body in those various partic=
ulars. In imputed wounds=20

the clothes are generally cut when off the body and can seldom be done so a=
s to deceive a careful=20

examiner. Several wounds cannot exist in the same region of the body withou=
t some being bloody=20

and showing the marks of it on the clothes. Even a single wound of the clot=
hes=20
