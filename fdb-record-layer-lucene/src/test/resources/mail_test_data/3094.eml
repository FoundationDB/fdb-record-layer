hit world markets in the next few years, as Iraq's dilapidated and outdated=

Moreover, Russian oil is cheap compared to the North Sea or Alaskan varieti=

constitutes an attractive investment opportunity as the recent takeover of =
Tyumen Oil by British=20

Petroleum proves. Still, the long-term risk of being unseated by a reconstr=
ucted Iraq as the second=20

largest oil producer in the world is tangible.  Russia has spent the last s=
ix months enhancing old=20

alliances and constructing new bridges. According to Interfax, the Russian =
news agency,=20

yesterday, Russia has made yet another payment of $27 million to the Intern=
ational Monetary=20

Fund. The Russian and Romanian prime ministers met and signed bilateral agr=
eements for the=20

first time since 1989. This week, after 12 years of abortive contacts, the =

strategically crucial ally. Last week, British police, in a sudden display =
of unaccustomed efficacy,=20

nabbed Russian oligarch and mortal Putin-foe, Boris Berezovsky, charged by =

defrauding the Samara region of $13 million while he was director of LogoVa=
z in 1994-5.  The=20

Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, did not remain oblivious to these ov=
ertures. Russia and the=20

USA remain partners, he asserted. RIA Novosti, the Russian news agency, quo=
ted him as saying:=20

"If we settle the Iraqi problem by political means and in an accord, the ro=
ad will open to teamwork=20

on other, no less involved problems."  As Robert Kagan correctly observes i=
n his essay "Of=20

Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order", the weaker =
a polity is=20

militarily, the stricter its adherence to international law, the only prote=
ction, however feeble, from=20

bullying. Putin, presiding over a decrepit and bloated army, naturally insi=
sts that the country of the=20

Iroquois during the next six years.  In the first he paddled in canoes {32}=
 up the Richelieu River=20

and came to a beautiful lake, to which he gave his own name ("Lake Champlai=
n"). Meeting a party=20

of Iroquois of the Mohawk nation or tribe, he fell upon them suddenly.  The=
 Mohawks fancied at=20

first that they had only to do with Algonquins, and felt confident of victo=
ry, until the Frenchmen's=20

muskets rang out; then not fast enough could they flee in panic from the ma=
gic bullets, leaving=20

many slain, including their bravest chiefs.  Champlain had only 60 Frenchme=
n and Indians, while=20

the Mohawks numbered 200; but his victory was complete; not one of his forc=
e was killed, and the=20

town of the enemy was wiped from the face of the earth.  Notwithstanding Ch=
amplain's protests,=20

the Algonquins insisted on torturing one of their Iroquois captives to deat=
h by every device of=20

savage cruelty.  Mercy was not in their code; they neither gave it, nor, wh=
en captured, expected it.=20

During the next three years Champlain was kept very busy in explorations, i=
n attacking the=20

Iroquois, and in protecting his colony.  During this time he returned to Fr=
ance, and was favourably=20

received at Fontainebleau by King Henry, who listened with interest to Cham=
plain's tale of his=20

adventures in "New France."  But in spite of royal favour, Champlain had so=
 many rivals and=20

enemies that, like Poutraincourt in Acadia, he found it impossible to get t=
he charter renewed, and=20

so his friend and patron, De Monts, was obliged to try and get along withou=
t it.  Equipping two=20

more ships, he sent Champlain back with them to Canada.  The great ambition=
 of Champlain's=20



soul was to {33} find a passage through the continent to China.  At last it=
 seemed to him that the=20

friendliness of the Hurons and Algonquins would furnish him with the means =
of attaining this=20

desire.  He had just made arrangements with the chiefs, when the news came =
to him of King=20

Henry's assassination, and he felt it was necessary for him to return witho=
ut delay again to France.=20

De Monts, his patron, still enjoyed the title of Lieutenant-General of New =
France, but his resources=20

and influence had been sadly crippled by the King's death, and the cost of =
keeping up Quebec,=20

Tadoussac, and Acadia was very great.  He had no longer the monopoly, that =
is to say, the sole=20

right of buying and selling Canadian furs--it was a right=20


_
governed by international regulation and not by the "rule of the fist".  Bu=
t Kagan - and Putin - get it=20

backwards as far as the European Union is concerned. Its members are not co=
mpelled to uphold=20

international prescripts by their indisputable and overwhelming martial def=
iciency. Rather, after=20

centuries of futile bloodletting, they choose not to resort to weapons and,=
 instead, to settle their=20

differences juridically.  Thus, Putin is not a European in the full sense o=
f the word. He supports an=20

international framework of dispute settlement because he has no armed choic=
e, not because it=20

tallies with his deeply held convictions and values. According to Kagan, Pu=
tin is, in essence, an=20

American: he believes that the world order ultimately rests on military pow=
er and the ability to=20

project it.  Russia aspires to be America, not France. Its business ethos, =
grasp of realpolitik,=20

nuclear arsenal and evolving values place it firmly in the Anglo-Saxon camp=
. Its dalliance with=20

France and Germany is hardly an elopement. Had Russia been courted more agg=
ressively by=20

Secretary of State, Colin Powell and its concerns shown more respect by the=
 American=20

administration, it would have tilted differently. It is a lesson to be memo=
rized in Washington.=20

History teaches us little except how little we can learn from it. Still, th=
ere is nothing new under the=20

sun. Thus, drawing too many parallels between the environmentalist movement=
s of the late 19th=20

century and their counterparts in the second half of the twentieth century =
- would probably prove=20

misleading. Similarly, every fin de siecle has its Fukuyama, proclaiming th=
e end of history and the=20

victory of liberalism and capitalism.  Liberal parliamentarianism (coupled =
with unbridled=20

individualistic capitalism) seemed to irreversibly dominate the political l=
andscape by 1890 - when it=20

was suddenly and surprisingly toppled by the confluence of revolutionary au=
thoritarian nationalism=20

and revolutionary authoritarian socialism.  Yet, every ostensibly modern (o=
r post-modern)=20

phenomenon has roots and mirrors in history. The spreading of the occult, m=
aterialism,=20

rationalism, positivism, ethnic cleansing, regionalism, municipal autonomy,=
 environmentalism,=20

alienation ("ennui"), information networking, globalization, anti-globaliza=
tion, mass migration,=20

capital and labour mobility, free trade - are all new mantras but very old =
phenomena.  Sometimes=20

the parallels are both overwhelming and instructive.  Overview  Karl Marx r=
egarded Louis-

Napoleon's Second Empire as the first modern dictatorship - supported by th=
e middle and upper=20

classes but independent of their patronage and, thus, self-perpetuating. Ot=
hers went as far as=20

calling it proto-fascistic.  Yet, the Second Empire was insufficiently auth=
oritarian or revolutionary to=20

warrant this title. It did foster and encourage a personality cult, akin to=
 the "Fuhrerprinzip" -but it=20

derived its legitimacy, conservatively, from the Church and from the electo=
rate. It was an odd=20

mixture of Bonapartism, militarism, clericalism, conservatism and liberalis=
m.  In a way, the Second=20

Republic did amount to a secular religion, replete with martyrs and apostle=
s. It made use of the=20

nascent mass media to manipulate public opinion. It pursued industrializati=
on and administrative=20

modernization. But these features characterized all the political movements=
 of the late 19th=20

century, including socialism, and other empires, such as the Habsburg Austr=
o-Hungary.  The=20

Second Empire was, above all, inertial. It sought to preserve the bureaucra=
tic, regulatory, and=20

economic frameworks of the First Empire.  It was a rationalist, positivist,=
 and materialist movement=20

- despite the deliberate irrationalism of the young Louis-Napoleon. It was =
not affiliated to a=20

revolutionary party, nor to popular militias.  It was not collectivist. And=
 its demise was the outcome=20

of military defeat.  The Second Empire is very reminiscent of Vladimir Puti=
n's reign in post-Yeltsin=20



Russia.  Like the French Second Empire, it follows a period of revolutions =
and counter-revolutions.=20

It is not identified with any one class but does rely on the support of the=
 middle class, the=20

intelligentsia, the managers and industrialists, the security services, and=
 the military.  Putin is=20

authoritarian, but not revolutionary. His regime derives its legitimacy fro=
m parliamentary and=20

presidential elections based on a neo-liberal model of government. It is so=
cially conservative but=20

seeks to modernize Russia's administration and economy. Yet, it manipulates=
 the mass media and=20

encourages a personality cult.  Disparate Youths  Like Napoleon III, Putin =
started off as president=20

(he was shortly as prime minister under Yeltsin). Like him, he may be undon=
e by a military defeat,=20

probably in the Caucasus or Central Asia.  The formative years of Putin and=
 Louis-Napoleon have=20

little in common, though.  The former was a cosseted member of the establis=
hment and witnessed,=20

first hand, the disintegration of his country. Putin was a KGB apparatchik.=
 The KGB may have=20

inspired, conspired in, or even instigated the transformation in Russian do=
mestic affairs since the=20

early 1980's - but to call it "revolutionary" would be to stretch the term.=
  Louis-Napoleon, on the=20

other hand, was a true revolutionary. He narrowly escaped death at the hand=
s of Austrian troops=20

in a rebellion in Italy in 1831. His brother was not as lucky. Louis-Napole=
on's claim to the throne of=20

France (1832) was based on a half-baked ideology of imperial glory, concoct=
ed, disseminated and=20

promoted by him. In 1836 and 1840 he even initiated  (failed) coups d'etat.=
 He was expelled even=20

from neutral Switzerland and exiled to the USA. He spent six years in priso=
n.  An Eerie=20

Verisimilitude  Still, like Putin, Napoleon III was elected president. Like=
 him, he was regarded by=20

his political sponsors as Champlain on his next voyage back from France onc=
e more sailed up the=20

St. Lawrence, he found many strange fur-traders trafficking with the savage=
s.  The leader had now=20

more to do and think about than ever; he wished, moreover, to prepare a fit=
ting home for a fair and=20

youthful partner who was ever in his thoughts.  During his absence in Paris=
 he had espoused a=20

charming Huguenot girl named Helen Bouill, daughter of the murdered King's =
private secretary.=20

Her name survives to-day in "Helen's Island" in the river opposite Montreal=
.  So many traders did=20

Champlain find in the vicinity of this island, that he built a fort there a=
nd resolved to turn the site of=20

Hochelaga into a trading station.  Two uneventful years passed by, and then=
, in the very year=20

Argall was destroying hapless Port Royal (1613), Champlain's imagination wa=
s kindled by the {34}=20

astonishing tale of a certain Nicholas Vignau.  This adventurer had passed =
a winter amongst the=20

red-men of the upper Ottawa River.  Vignau told his chief that, in company =
with some Algonquins,=20

he had once arrived at a remote sea-shore, where his eyes had beheld the fr=
agments of a=20

wrecked English ship.  Champlain's heart bounded with joy; he thought his h=
opes were now about=20

to be realised.  Taking Vignau, two white followers, and an Indian guide, t=
he explorer passed the=20

dangerous rapids of the Ottawa and made the acquaintance, one after another=
, of its lakes,=20

cataracts, and islands.  He pressed on, passed the Rideau (Curtain) Falls, =
so named because of=20

the resemblance of this sheet of water to a great white curtain.  He and hi=
s awe-struck=20

companions stared at the raging, foaming cauldron of the Chaudire, close to=
 where the city of=20

Ottawa, capital of the Canadian Dominion, now stands, while the Indians cas=
t into the waters gifts=20

of tobacco and other things to propitiate the angry god of the waters.  At =
last the party reached=20

Allumette Island.  Here dwelt a friendly Algonquin chief named Tessouat, wh=
o received the=20

Frenchmen hospitably and invited them to a banquet.  Tessouat knew Vignau; =
he knew also how=20

he had passed his time amongst the men of his tribe.  So when Champlain rel=
ated at the feast=20



what Vignau had told him of his journey to the sea-shore, Tessouat bluntly =
told his guest that=20

Vignau, though a pale-face, was a liar, and that he had never been on such =
a journey. For a while=20

the shock of this discovery overwhelmed Champlain with rage and sorrow.  {3=
5} Tessouat was so=20

indignant at the way the French leader had been deceived, that he wanted Vi=
gnau to be put to=20

death, but Champlain was of too noble and forgiving a nature for that, and =
contented himself with=20

rebuking the offender.  At the same time, although Vignau confessed his fal=
sehood, we are able to=20

see to-day a certain foundation for his story which was obscured from Canad=
a's founder.  We=20

happen to know now what Champlain centuries ago did not dream of: that only=
 three hundred=20

miles separate Allumette Island from the southern end of the great inland s=
ea, Hudson's Bay. This=20

body of water two or three brief seasons before had been discovered by an E=
nglishman, who, like=20

Champlain, had tried to find a short route to China and the East Indies.  I=
n 1610 Henry Hudson, in=20

the pay of the Dutch, sailed up the river which now bears his name, and pav=
ed the way for the=20

Dutch colony, afterwards called the New Netherlands.  A year later, in the =
service of England, he=20

sailed northwards in the _Half Moon_, passed through the narrow Hudson's St=
raits, and so on into=20

the ice-bound inland sea. There his terrified crew mutinied, turning their =
brave commander adrift in=20

an open boat, together with his son and two of his faithful companions.  Th=
us perished Henry=20

Hudson, who was never heard of again.  As for the craven mutineers, when th=
ey stole back guiltily=20

to England, they were seized and made to pay the penalty of their crime. Th=
ree ships were sent=20

out to search for Hudson, but, alas, it was then too late.  Of this inland =
sea Vignau may have heard=20

stories {36} from the Indians.  It may be that those who told him had reall=
y seen the wreck of poor=20

Henry Hudson's boat on the shores, but this we shall never really know unti=
l the great Day of=20

Judgment comes, when the sea gives up its dead and all secrets of the deep =
are known.  In the=20

discovery of Lake Ontario, two years later, Champlain found some compensati=
on for his=20

disappointment.  He was the first European to visit the "freshwater sea," a=
s he called it.  He=20

penned a description of all he had seen, and carried it to France, where it=
 was eagerly read.  One=20

of Champlain's mottoes was that "the salvation of a single soul was worth m=
ore than the conquest=20

of an Empire."  Up to now Quebec had been wholly without priests, but when =
Champlain returned=20

to the colony he brought out four priests of the Order of the Recollets, pi=
ous men who had taken=20

vows of poverty and self-denial.  These set about converting the savages to=
 Christianity. One of=20

them, Joseph Le Caron, went forward to the distant Huron country, which had=
 not yet been visited=20

by any European.  Champlain himself accompanied the priest from Quebec.  On=
 reaching the=20

rapids just above Montreal, the Governor held a conference with the Hurons,=
 who had come from=20

their homes in the West to meet him and induce him to fulfil his pledge to =
attack the Iroquois.  This=20

expedition was one of the most fateful episodes in Champlain's life.  He kn=
ew nothing about=20

Iroquois history or character.  If he had had any suspicion of what his pre=
sent action was to cost=20

his countrymen in Canada, he would rather have died {37} than provoke the e=
nmity of so terrible a=20

foe.  Champlain chose this time to take a most round-about route, measuring=
 full 300 leagues, he=20

and his men often carrying on their backs the canoes and baggage, living on=
 coarse food, and=20

suffering many hardships.  Even the priest was obliged to take his share of=
 the hardest work,=20

paddling his oar=20


_
instrument. Like Putin, he had no parliamentary or political experience. Bo=
th of them won elections=20

by promising "order" and "prosperity" coupled with "social compassion". And=
, like Putin, Louis-

Napoleon, to the great chagrin of his backers, proved to be his own man - i=
ndependent-minded,=20

determined, and tough.  Putin, like Louis-Napoleon before him, proceeded to=
 expand his powers=20

and installed loyalists in every corner of the administration and the army.=
 Like Louis-Napoleon,=20

Putin is a populist, traveling staggering through the forest with a load su=
ch as a mule might carry,=20

and with it all obliged, with the whole party, to hasten at full speed for =
fear of falling behind into the=20

hands of Iroquois.  In those days when there were no roads and hardly even =
any long paths,=20

travellers made their way by following the rivers and lakes in canoes.  Whe=
n they came to the end=20

of one waterway and wished to reach the beginning of another, they followed=
 what were called the=20

portages or carrying-places, paths in the woods,=20


_
the country, posing for photo opportunities, responding to citizens' querie=
s in Q-and-A radio=20

shows, siding with the "average bloke" on every occasion, taking advantage =
of Russia's previous=20

economic and social disintegration to project an image of a "strong man".  =
Putin is as little=20

dependent on the Duma as Napoleon III was on his parliament. But Putin reap=
ed what Boris=20

Yeltsin, his predecessor, has sown when he established an imperial presiden=
cy after what=20

amounted to a coup d'etat in 1993 (the bombing of the Duma). Napoleon had t=
o organize his own=20

coup d'etat all by himself in 1852.  The Balancing Act  Napoleon III - as d=
oes Putin now - faced a=20

delicate balancing act between the legitimacy conferred by parliamentary li=
beralism and the need=20

to maintain a police state. When he sought to strengthen the enfeebled legi=
slature he reaped only=20

growing opposition within it to his domestic and foreign policies alike.  H=
e liberalized the media=20

and enshrined in France's legal code various civil freedoms. But he also se=
t in motion and=20

sanctioned a penumbral, all-pervasive and clandestine security apparatus wh=
ich regularly=20

gathered information on millions of Frenchmen and foreigners.  Modernizatio=
n and Reform  Putin=20

is considerably less of an economic modernizer than was yards long and some=
times as long as=20

nine or ten miles.  For many weeks did Champlain sojourn in the Huron count=
ry, and then, in early=20

autumn, he departed from their chief town, Carhagonha, on Lake Simcoe, with=
 several hundred=20

red warriors, to inflict chastisement on the painted warriors of the Five N=
ations.  Crossing Lake=20

Simcoe, Champlain and his followers travelled slowly and with much hardship=
 through the country=20

north of Lake Ontario, until by this very roundabout route the whole party =
came in a month's time=20

to the fort of the Onondagas, which they intended to attack.  As they drew =
near, the French {38}=20

and Indians fell in with outlying bands of this tribe, capturing many priso=
ners.  Champlain strove=20

unceasingly to induce his Huron allies to show mercy to the captives, but t=
he Indian warrior always=20

deemed mercy a pitiful sign of weakness.  He wanted not only to cut off the=
 hands and feet of the=20

male prisoners, gouge out their eyes and burn them alive, but to torture th=
e women and children=20

as well.  Only was it when Champlain threatened to withdraw his French sold=
iers altogether that=20

the Huron chiefs consented to confine their barbarities to the men alone.  =
When the allies got=20

closer to the Onondaga fort they found it was much more strongly defended t=
han they had=20

III. Putin also seems to be less interested in the social implications of h=
is policies, in poverty=20

alleviation and in growing economic inequalities and social tensions. Napol=

all seasons - a buffer against socialism as well as a utopian rows of stron=
g stakes, and a thick wall=20

made of heavy branches of trees.  On the top of this wall were gutters of w=
