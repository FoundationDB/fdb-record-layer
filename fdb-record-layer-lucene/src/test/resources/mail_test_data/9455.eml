WALERAN COUNT DE SAINT POL SENDS A CHALLENGE TO THE KING OF         ENGLAND=
.=20

In this same year, Waleran count de St Pol sent a challenge to the king of =
England, in the=20

following words:  =E2=80=98Most high and mighty prince Henry, duke of Lanca=
ster,=E2=80=94I Waleran de=20

Luxembourg, count de Ligny and de St Pol, considering the affinity, love, a=
nd modifying elements,=20

as artificial compression, pathological deformities, posthumous distortions=
, and hygrometric=20

conditions, may affect particularly the skull, and if due allowance be not =
made for these the study=20

may lead to glaring absurdities. Not longer ago than 1725 there was found i=
n a quarry at =C5=92ningen=20

the skull of a fossil batrachian compressed into rude resemblance to the hu=
man cranium, which=20

was announced to the world as Scheuchzer=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9C_Homo diluvii t=
estis et theoscopos_,=E2=80=9D and as the=20

remains of one of the sinful antediluvians who perished in the Noachic delu=
ge.   ARE THE BONES=20

OLD OR RECENT?  An important point may arise in questions of identification=
 of bones as to the=20

oldness: whether they are old or recent. The first indication is furnished =
by the presence or by the=20

absence of the soft parts. The existence of the periosteum and of the spina=
l marrow is the most=20

persistent proof of a recent state; but these alone with the soft parts are=
 usually destroyed in two=20

or three years. In ordinary circumstances a body becomes skeletonized in ab=
out ten years,=20

although in exceptional cases the cadaver=20


_
England, whose sister I married[38], and whose destruction you are notoriou=
sly accused of, and=20

greatly blamed for;=E2=80=94considering also the disgrace I and my descenda=
nts would feel, as well as=20

the indignation of an all-powerful God, if I did not attempt to revenge the=
 death of the said king, my=20

father-in-law;=E2=80=94  =E2=80=98I make known to you by these presents, th=
at I will annoy you by every possible=20

means in my power, and that personally, and by my friends, relations and su=
bjects, I will do you=20

every mischief by sea and land, beyond the limits of the kingdom of France,=
 for the cause before=20

said, and no way for the acts that have taken place, and may hereafter take=
 place, between my=20

very redoubted lord and sovereign, the king of France, and the kingdom of E=
ngland.  =E2=80=98This I certify=20

to you under my seal, given at my castle of Luxembourg, the 10th day of Feb=
ruary, in the year=20

1402.=E2=80=99  This letter was carried to the king of England by a herald =
of count Waleran; and thereto the=20

king, Henry, made answer, that he held his menaces cheap, and that it was h=
is will that count=20

Waleran should enjoy his country and his subjects.  The count de St Pol,  T=
his summer in=20

transferring an old cemetery in Georgetown, D. C., the remains of the grand=
mother of one of the=20

writer=E2=80=99s patients were found in such a state of preservation as to =
be easily recognized after fifty=20

years of burial. More recently, in unearthing the remains of an old graveya=
rd in East Washington, a=20

striking peculiarity was noticed in the fact that many bodies of young peop=
le buried in recent years=20

when taken up consisted of a few blackened bones and shreds of grave-clothe=
s. while the remains=20

of many older people buried long before the Civil War were found in an exce=
llent state of=20

preservation. One of these was a Mr. Fullin, who died from the effects of a=
 sunstroke forty years=20

ago and was buried in a metallic case. An old lady who attended his funeral=
 was present when his=20

remains were unearthed and said they looked as natural as when he was laid =
away in 1852. The=20

features were well preserved and even the white linen of the shroud was uns=
oiled.  Alterations in=20

the texture of the bone, such as that caused by dryness and by diminution i=
n the proportion of=20

organic matter, may be ascertained by histological=20


_
begin the war against the king of England and his allies. He also caused to=
 be made, in his castle=20

of Bohain, a figure to represent the earl of Rutland[39], with an emblazone=
d coat of arms, and a=20

portable gibbet, which he got secretly conveyed to one of his forts in the =
country of the Boulonois;=20

and thence he caused them to be carried by Robinet de Robretanges, Aliaume =
de Biurtin, and=20

other experienced warriors, to the gates of Calais. There the gibbet was er=
ected, and the figure of=20

the earl of Rutland hung on it by the feet; and when this was done, the abo=
ve persons returned to=20

their fort.  When the english garrison in Calais saw this spectacle in the =
morning, they were much=20

surprised thereat, and without delay cut the figure down, and carried it in=
to the town. After that=20

time, they were more inclined than ever to do mischief to the count Waleran=
 and his subjects.=20

CHAP. XI.      CONCERNING THE SENDING OF SIR JAMES DE BOURBON, COUNT DE LA=
=20

MARCHE, AND HIS TWO BROTHERS, BY ORDERS FROM age may be furnished by taking=
 into=20

consideration the specific weight. Placing the skull at an average density =
of 1,649, that of an infant=20

would be 1,515, an adult 1,726, and that of old age 1,636.  Ascertaining th=
e proportion of organic=20

and inorganic matter, the phosphates and carbonates, by chemical means may =
furnish an=20

additional help in the interpretation of the remains.  With all these diagn=
ostic methods it may still=20

be impossible to establish identity either absolute or relative, even where=
 a whole skeleton is in=20

question. The evidence may, however, be of great juridical use to the accus=
ed, as in the case of=20

Van Solen, tried for the murder of Dr. Henry Harcourt, where the collective=
 facts pointed to the=20

identification of a body dead two years. The jury, however, after a second =
trial, were instructed to=20

acquit unless they were certain that the remains were Harcourt=E2=80=99s. T=
hey acquitted, as no _one_=20

decided and apparent feature was known to have existed by which the remains=
 could be identified=20

beyond a doubt.[572]   IDENTITY=20
