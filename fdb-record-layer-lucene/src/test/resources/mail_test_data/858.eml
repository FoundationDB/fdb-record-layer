ked up in the _
Astrology and divination. Vitellius dared not exile the Chaldaeans, as they=
 had announced the day=20

of their banishment as that of his death. Vespasian consulted them daily; D=
omitian would not=20

move without being advised by the prophets; Adrian was a learned Astrologer=
 himself; and all of=20

them, ending with Julian (called the _Apostate_ because he would not become=
 one), believed in,=20

and addressed their prayers to, the Planetary "Gods." The Emperor Adrian, m=
oreover, "predicted=20

from the January calends up to December 31st, every event that happened to =
him daily." Under=20

the wisest emperors Rome had a School of Astrology, wherein were secretly t=
aught the occult=20

influences of the Sun, Moon, and Saturn.(631) Judiciary Astrology is used t=
o this day by the=20

Kabalists; and Eliphas Levi, the modern French Magus, teaches its rudiments=
 in his _Dogme et=20

Rituel de la Haute Magie_. But the key to ceremonial or ritualistic Astrolo=
gy, with the teraphim and=20

the urim and thummim of Magic, is lost to Europe. Hence our century of Mate=
rialism shrugs its=20

shoulders and sees in Astrology--a pretender.  Not all scientists scoff at =
it, however, and one may=20

rejoice in reading in the _Musee des Sciences_(632) the suggestive and fair=
 remarks made by Le=20

Couturier, a man of science of no mean reputation. He thinks it curious to =
notice that while the=20

bold speculations of Democritus are found vindicated by Dalton,       The r=
everies of the alchemists=20

are also on their way to a certain     rehabilitation. They receive renewed=
 life from the minute=20

investigations of their successors, the chemists; a very     remarkable thi=
ng indeed is to see how=20

much modern discoveries have     served to vindicate, of late, the theories=
 of the Middle Ages from=20

the charge of absurdity laid at their door. Thus, if, as     demonstrated b=
y Col. Sabine, the direction=20

of a piece of steel,     hung a few feet above the soil, may be influenced =
by the position     of the=20

moon, whose body is at a distance of 240,000 miles from our     planet, who=
 then could accuse of=20

extravagance the belief of the     ancient astrologers [or the modern, eith=
er] in the influence of=20

the stars on human destiny.(633)      SECTION XXXIX. CYCLES AND AVATARAS.  =
 We have=20

already drawn attention to the facts that the record of the life of a World=
-Saviour is emblematical,=20

and must be read by its mystic meaning, and that the figures 432 have a cos=
mic evolutionary=20

significance. We find these two facts throwing light on the origin of the e=
xoteric Christian religion,=20

and clearing away much of the obscurity surrounding its beginnings. For is =
it not clear that the=20

names and characters in the Synoptical Gospels and in that of St. John are =
not historical? Is it not=20

evident that the compilers of the life of Christ, desirous to show that the=
 birth of their Master was a=20

cosmic, astronomical, and divinely- preoerdained event, attempted to cooerd=
inate the same with=20

the end of the secret cycle, 4,320? When facts are collated this answers to=
 them as little as does=20

the other cycle of "thirty-three solar years, seven months, and seven days,=
" which has also been=20

brought forward as supporting the same claim, the soli-lunar cycle in which=
 the Sun gains on the=20

Moon one solar year. The combination of the three figures, 4, 3, 2, with cy=
phers according to the=20

cycle and had I not at this moment something very pressing to attend to."  =
Then taking Porthos=20

aside:  "My dear Du Vallon," he said, "here you are in full dress most fort=
unately, for I am going to=20

take you to the cardinal's."  "Gracious me! really!" exclaimed Porthos, ope=
ning his great wondering=20

eyes.  "Yes, my friend."  "A presentation? indeed!"  "Does that alarm you?"=
  "No, but it agitates=20

me."  "Oh! don't be distressed; you have to deal with a cardinal of another=
 kind. This one will not=20

oppress you by his dignity."  "'Tis the same thing--you understand me, D'Ar=
tagnan--a court."=20

"There's no court now. Alas!"  "The queen!"  "I was going to say, there's n=
o longer a queen. The=20

queen! Rest assured, we shall not see her."  "And you say that we are going=
 from here to the=20



Palais Royal?"  "Immediately. Only, that there may be no delay, I shall bor=
row one of your horses."=20

"Certainly; all the four are at your service."  "Oh, I need only one of the=
m for the time being."=20

"Shall we take our valets?"  "Yes, you may as well take Mousqueton. As to P=
lanchet, he has=20

certain reasons for not going to court."  "And what are they?"  "Oh, he doe=
sn't stand well with his=20

eminence."  "Mouston," said Porthos, "saddle Vulcan and Bayard."  "And for =
myself, monsieur,=20

shall I saddle Rustaud?"  "No, take a more stylish horse, Phoebus or Superb=
e; we are going with=20

some ceremony."  "Ah," said Mousqueton, breathing more freely, "you are onl=
y going, then, to=20

make a visit?"  "Oh! yes, of course, Mouston; nothing else. But to avoid ri=
sk, put the pistols in the=20

holsters. You will find mine on my saddle, already loaded."  Mouston breath=
ed a sigh; he couldn't=20

understand visits of ceremony made under arms.  "Indeed," said Porthos, loo=
king complacently at=20

his old lackey as he went away, "you are right, D'Artagnan; Mouston will do=
; Mouston has a very=20

fine appearance."  D'Artagnan smiled.  "But you, my friend--are you not goi=
ng to change your=20

dress?"  "No, I shall go as I am. This traveling dress will serve to show t=
he cardinal my haste to=20

obey his commands."  They set out on Vulcan and Bayard, followed by Mousque=
ton on Phoebus,=20

and arrived at the Palais Royal at about a quarter to seven. The streets we=
re crowded, for it was=20

the day of Pentecost, and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers=
; one as fresh as if he=20

had come out of a bandbox, the other so covered with dust that he looked as=
 if he had but just=20

come off a field of battle.  Mousqueton also attracted attention; and as th=
e romance of Don=20

Quixote was then the fashion, they said that he was Sancho, who, after havi=
ng lost one master,=20

had found two.  On reaching the palace, D'Artagnan sent to his eminence the=
 letter in which he=20

had been ordered to return without delay. He was soon ordered to the presen=
ce of the cardinal.=20

"Courage!" he whispered to Porthos, as they proceeded. "Do not be intimidat=
ed. Believe me, the=20

eye of the eagle is closed forever. We have only the vulture to deal with. =
Hold yourself as bolt=20

upright as on the day of the bastion of St. Gervais, and do not bow too low=
 to this Italian; that=20

might give him a poor idea of you."  "Good!" answered Porthos. "Good!"  Maz=
arin was in his study,=20

working at a list of pensions and benefices, of which he was trying to redu=
ce the number. He saw=20

D'Artagnan and Porthos enter with internal pleasure, yet=20


_
Hindu. It will remain a secret even though several of its significant featu=
res are revealed. It relates,=20

for instance, to the Pralaya of the races in their periodical dissolution, =
before which events a=20

special Avatara has always to descend and incarnate on earth. These figures=
 were adopted by all=20

the older nations, such as those of Egypt and Chaldaea, and before them wer=
e current among the=20

Atlanteans. Evidently some of the more learned among the early Church Fathe=
rs who had=20

dabbled, whilst Pagans, in temple secrets, knew them to relate to the Avata=
ric or Messianic=20

mystery, and tried to apply this cycle to the birth of their Messiah; they =
failed because the figures=20

relate to the respective ends of the Root-Races and not to any individual. =
In their badly-directed=20

efforts, moreover, an error of five years occurred. Is it possible, if thei=
r claims as to the importance=20

and universality of the event were correct, that such a vital mistake shoul=
d have been allowed to=20

creep into a chronological computation preoerdained and traced in the heave=
ns by the finger of=20

God? Again, what were the Pagan and even Jewish Initiates doing, if this cl=
aim as to Jesus be=20

correct? Could they, the custodians of the key to the secret cycles and Ava=
taras, the heirs of all=20

the Aryan, Egyptian, and Chaldaean wisdom, have failed to recognise their g=
reat "God-Incarnate,"=20

one with Jehovah,(634) their Saviour of the latter days, him whom all the n=
ations of Asia still=20

expect as their Kalki Avatara, Maitreya Buddha, Sosiosh, Messiah, etc.?  Th=
e simple secret is this:=20

There are cycles within greater cycles, which are all contained in the one =
Kalpa of 4,320,000=20

years. It is at the end of this cycle that the Kalki Avatara is expected--t=
he Avatara Whose name=20

and characteristics are secret, Who will come forth from Shamballa, the "Ci=
ty of Gods," which is in=20

the West for some nations, in the East for others, in the North or South fo=
r yet others. And this is=20

the reason why, from the Indian Rishi to Virgil, and from Zoroaster down to=
 the latest Sibyl, all=20

have, since the beginning of the Fifth Race, prophesied, sung, and promised=
 the cyclic return of=20

the Virgin--Virgo, the constellation--and the birth of a divine child who s=
hould bring back to our=20

earth the Golden Age.  No one, however fanatical, would have sufficient cou=
ntenance.  "Ah! you,=20

is it? Monsieur le lieutenant, you have been very prompt. 'Tis well. Welcom=
e to ye."  "Thanks, my=20

lord. Here I am at your eminence's service, as well as Monsieur du Vallon, =
one of my old friends,=20

who used to conceal his nobility under the name of Porthos."  Porthos bowed=
 to the cardinal.  "A=20

magnificent cavalier," remarked Mazarin.  Porthos turned his head to the ri=
ght and to the left, and=20

drew himself up with a movement full of dignity.  "The best swordsman in th=
e kingdom, my lord,"=20

said D'Artagnan.  Porthos bowed to his friend.  Mazarin was as fond of fine=
 soldiers as, in later=20

times, Frederick of Prussia used to be. He admired the strong hands, the br=
oad shoulders and the=20

steady eye of Porthos. He seemed to see before him the salvation of his adm=
inistration and of the=20

kingdom, sculptured in flesh and bone. He remembered that the old associati=
on of musketeers=20

was composed of four persons.  "And your two other friends?" he asked.  Por=
thos opened his=20

mouth, thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn; D'Artag=
nan checked him by a=20

glance from the corner of his eye.  "They are prevented at this moment, but=
 will join us later."=20

Mazarin coughed a little.  "And this gentleman, being disengaged, takes to =
the service willingly?"=20

he asked.  "Yes, my lord, and from pure devotion to the cause, for Monsieur=
 de Bracieux is rich."=20

"Rich!" said Mazarin, whom that single word always inspired with a great re=
spect.  "Fifty thousand=20

francs a year," said Porthos.  These were the first words he had spoken.  "=
From pure zeal?"=20

resumed Mazarin, with his artful smile; "from pure zeal and devotion then?"=
  "My lord has,=20

perhaps, no faith in those words?" said D'Artagnan.  "Have you, Monsieur le=
 Gascon?" asked=20



Mazarin, supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands.  "I,"=
 replied the Gascon, "I=20

believe in devotion as a word at one's baptism, for instance, which natural=
ly comes before one's=20

proper name; every one is naturally more or less devout, certainly; but the=
re should be at the end=20

of one's devotion something to gain."  "And your friend, for instance; what=
 does he expect to have=20

at the end of his devotion?"  "Well, my lord, my friend has three magnifice=
nt estates: that of Vallon,=20

at Corbeil; that of Bracieux, in the Soissonais; and that of=20


_
that the Christian era has ever been a return to the Golden Age--Virgo havi=
ng actually entered into=20

Libra since then. Let us trace as briefly as possible the Christian traditi=
ons to their true origin.  First=20

of all, they discover in a few lines from Virgil a direct prophecy of the b=
irth of Christ. Yet it is=20

impossible to detect in this prophecy any feature of the present age. It is=
 in the famous fourth=20

Eclogue in which, half a century before our era, Pollio is made to ask the =
Muses of Sicily to sing to=20

him about greater events.       The last era of Cumaean song is now arrived=
 and the grand series=20

of     ages [that series which recurs again and again in the course of     =
our mundane revolution]=20

begins afresh. Now the Virgin Astraea     returns, and the reign of Saturn =
recommences. Now a=20

new progeny     _descends from the celestial realms_. Do thou, chaste Lucin=
a,     smile propitious=20

to the infant Boy who will bring to a close the     present Age of Iron,(63=
5) and introduce=20

throughout the whole world     the Age of Gold.... He shall share the life =
of Gods and shall see=20

heroes mingled in society with Gods, himself be seen by them and     all th=
e peaceful world....=20

Then shall the herds no longer dread     the huge lion, the serpent also sh=
all die: and the poison's=20

deceptive plant shall perish. Come then, dear child of the Gods,   his thre=
e estates erected into a=20

barony."  "Only that?" said Mazarin, his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing =
that he could pay for=20

Porthos's devotion without opening his purse; "only that? That can be manag=
ed."  "I shall be=20

baron!" explained Porthos, stepping forward.  "I told you so," said D'Artag=
nan, checking him with=20

his hand; "and now his eminence confirms it."  "And you, Monsieur D'Artagna=
n, what do you=20

want?"  "My lord," said D'Artagnan, "it is twenty years since Cardinal de R=
ichelieu made me=20

lieutenant."  "Yes, and you would be gratified if Cardinal Mazarin should m=
ake you captain."=20

D'Artagnan bowed.  "Well, that is not impossible. We will see, gentlemen, w=
e will see. Now,=20

Monsieur de Vallon," said Mazarin, "what service do you prefer, in the town=
 or in the country?"=20

Porthos opened his mouth to reply.  "My lord," said D'Artagnan, "Monsieur d=
e Vallon is like me, he=20

prefers service extraordinary--that is to say, enterprises that are conside=
red mad and impossible."=20

That boastfulness was not displeasing to Mazarin; he fell into meditation. =
 "And yet," he said, "I=20

must admit that I sent for you to appoint you to quiet service; I have cert=
ain apprehensions--well,=20

what is the meaning of that?"  In fact, a great noise was heard in the ante=
-chamber; at the same=20

time the door of the study was burst open and a man, covered with dust,=20


_
is shaken with its globe saluting thee: the earth, the regions of     the s=
ea, and the heavens=20

sublime.(636)   It is in these few lines, called the "Sibylline prophecy ab=
out the coming of Christ,"=20

that his followers now see a direct foretelling of the event. Now who will =
presume to maintain that=20

either at the birth of Jesus or since the establishment of the so-called Ch=
ristian religion, any=20

portion of the above-quoted sentences can be shown as prophetic? Has the "l=
ast age"--the Age of=20

Iron, or Kali Yuga--closed since then? Quite the reverse, since it is shown=
 to be in full sway just=20

now, not only because the Hindus use the name, but by universal personal ex=
perience. Where is=20

that "new race that has descended from the celestial realms"? Was it the ra=
ce that emerged from=20

Paganism into  "My lord the cardinal! my lord the cardinal!"  Mazarin thoug=
ht that some one was=20

going to assassinate him and he drew back, pushing his chair on the castors=
. D'Artagnan and=20

Porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the=
 cardinal.  "Well,=20

sir," exclaimed Mazarin, "what's the matter? and why do you rush in here, a=
s if you were about to=20

penetrate a crowded market-place?"  "My lord," replied the messenger, "I wi=
sh to speak to your=20

eminence in secret. I am Monsieur du Poins, an officer in the guards, on du=
ty at the donjon of=20

Vincennes."  Mazarin, perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messe=
nger that he had=20

something of importance to say, made a sign that D'Artagnan and Porthos sho=
uld give place.=20

D'Artagnan and Porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet.=20
