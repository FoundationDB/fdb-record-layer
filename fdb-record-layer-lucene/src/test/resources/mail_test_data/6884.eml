changing the subject uneasily.  "Yes," said Harold. "Every child in the cit=
y owns a lion-doll. Your=20

Majesty ought to visit the great factory at Derrydown, near where Claribel =
lived,--where the dolls=20

are still made. It is close by the Ancient Wood, where there was such good =
hunting, and where=20

David had his adventure with the Old Gnome, you know."  "No, I do not know =
the Old Gnome,"=20

retorted the Red King peevishly. "How do you expect me to know all the lege=
nds of your precious=20

country? We know nothing about this Kingdom in my own warlike land."  "Then=
 why should you=20

want to fight us?" asked Harold. "If you had taken the trouble to know us b=
etter, you could then=20

judge whether we deserve to be fought. But I think you would like our peopl=
e if you knew them."=20

Again Red Rex changed the subject. "What of the hunting in this Ancient Woo=
d?" he asked.=20

"When I have taken your city, and  Mr Wog took out a pocket-book, and made =
a note; while he=20

was doing so, he said, with a sly look, "Have you an old English word for '=
quite a fine gurl'?"  "No,"=20

I said; "they are a modern invention."  "Well, sir, I can tell you the one =
that sat 'twixt you and me at=20

dinner would knock the spots out of some of our 'Sent' Louis belles."  In m=
y then frame of mind the=20

remark caused me such acute pain that I plunged into a conversation that wa=
s going on between=20

Grandon and Dickiefield on the present state of our relations with Brazil, =
and took no further notice=20

of Mr Wog for the rest of the evening; only, as my readers may possibly hea=
r more of him in=20

society during this season, I have thought it right to introduce him to the=
m at once.  We all went to=20

hear Broadhem's speech next day, and whatever might have been our private o=
pinion upon the=20

matter, we all, with the exception of=20


_
your Kingdom, I will go there to hunt."  "There was good hunting," said Har=
old, "once upon a time.=20

In those days one had to beware the wicked Gnomes of the Great Fear. That w=
as why the Old=20

One fled."  "What about this 'Old One,' and this 'Great Fear'?" asked the R=
ed King. "I suppose that=20

is another story which you want to read to me."  "Nay; I do not care to rea=
d the tale unless Your=20

Majesty wishes it," said Harold with dignity. "But if Your Majesty desires =
a lion-doll for your little=20

Princess, I can get one for you and return with it and the story at the sam=
e time. John Chundango=20

and Joseph Caribbee Islands both made most effective speeches, but we did n=
ot feel the least=20

called upon to congratulate them: they each alluded with great affection to=
 the heathen and to Lord=20

Broadhem. Chundango drew a facetious contrast between his lordship and an e=
ffeminate young=20

Eastern prince, which was highly applauded by the audience that crowded the=
 town-hall of=20

Gullaby; and Joseph made a sort of grim joke about the probable effect of t=
he "Court of Final=20

Appeal" upon the theological tenets of the Caribbee Islanders, that made La=
dy Broadhem cough=20
