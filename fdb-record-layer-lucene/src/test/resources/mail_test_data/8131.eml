that they should not vote because they had not registered and were not qualified. After much 

arguing Mr. Doggett saw that Sherman could not be made "to see the light" and left with his 

prospective voters. William Sherman once served upon a United States Federal jury during his 

colorful life.  In appearance he could easily be regarded as a phenomenon. He is ninety-four years 

of age, though he appears to be only about fifty-five. His hair is black and not grey as would be 

expected; his face is round and unlined; he has dark piercing but kindly eyes. He is of medium 

stature. He has an exceptionally alert mind and recalls past events with the ease of a youth. The 

Indian blood that flows in his veins is plainly visible in his features, the color of his skin and the 

texture of his hair.  He gives as his reason for his lengthy life the Indian blood that is in him and 

says that he expects to live for nintey-four more years. Today he lives alone. He raises a few 

vegetables and is content in the memories of his past life which has been full. (2)   REFERENCES 

1. Most of his friends call him SHERMAN, hence he adopted that name.  2. A personal interview 

with other day, at a meeting of labourers, pointed with pride, and no doubt, with honest pride, to a 

labourer who had brought up a family of twelve children on twelve shillings a week I will venture to 

say the squire spent as much on any horse in his stables. Meat never touched the peasant's lips, 

though game, preserved for his landlord's pleasure, was running round his cottage. His children 

could not be educated, because they were wanted, almost from their infancy, to help in keeping 

the family from starving, as stonepickers, or perambulating scarecrows. His abode was a hovel, in 

which comfort, decency, morality could not dwell; and it was mainly owing to this cause that, as I 

have heard an experienced clergyman say, even the people in the low quarters of cities were less 

immoral than the rural poor. How the English peasants lived on such wages as they had, was a 

question which puzzled the best informed. How they died was clear enough; as penal paupers in a 

union workhouse. Yet Hodge's back, like that of Jacques Bonhomme, in France, bore everything, 

bore the great war against Republican France; for the squires and rectors, who made that war for

SAMUEL SMALLS   A VOLUNTARY SLAVE FOR SEVEN YEARS  The story of a free Negro of 

Connecticut, who came south to observe conditions of slavery, found them very distasteful, then 

voluntarily entered that slavery for seven years is the taxes back in increased rents and tithes. 

How did the peasantry exist, what was their condition in those days when wheat was at a hundred, 

or even a hundred and thirty shillings? They were reduced to a second serfage. They became in 

the mass parish paupers, and were divided, like slaves, among the employers of each parish. Men 

may be made serfs, and even slaves by other means than open force, in a country

Smalls, 84 year old ex-slave of 1704 Johnson Street, Jacksonville, tells of his father Cato Smith. 

Smith had been born in Connecticut, son of domestic slaves who were freed while he was still a 

child. He grew to young manhood in the northern state, making a living for himself as a carpenter 

and builder. At these trades he is said to have been very efficient.  Still unmarried at the age of 

about 30, he found in himself a desire to travel and see how other Negroes in the country lived. 

This he did, going from all are free, where the impossibility of slavery is the boast of the law. Of 

late benevolence has been, abroad in the English parish, almsgiving and visiting have increased, 

good landlords have taken up cottage improvements. There have been harvest-homes, at which 

the young squires have danced with cottagers. But now Hodge has taken the matter into his own 

hands, and it seems not without effect. In a letter which I have seen, a squire says, "Here the 

people are all contented; we (the employers) have seen the
