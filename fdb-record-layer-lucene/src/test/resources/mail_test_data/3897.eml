=E2=80=98I have observed an omission of another sort, but which must be att=
ributed solely to the=20

copyists,=E2=80=94for I suspect them of having lost a considerable part of =
a chapter in the second volume.=20

The head of this chapter is, =E2=80=98The duke of Orleans returns to the du=
ke of Burgundy,=E2=80=99=E2=80=94and the=20

beginning of it describes the meeting of the two princes in the town of H=
=C3=AAdin in 1441 (1442). They=20

there determine to meet again almost immediately in the town of Nevers, =E2=
=80=98with many others of the=20

great princes and lords of the kingdom of France,=E2=80=99 and at the end o=
f eight days they separate; the=20

one taking the road through Paris for Blois, and the other going into Burgu=
ndy.  =E2=80=98This recital=20

consists of about twenty lines, and then we read, =E2=80=98Here follows a c=
opy of the declaration sent to=20

king Charles of France by the lords assembled at Nevers, with the answers r=
eturned thereto by the=20

members of the great council, and certain requests made by them.=E2=80=99 T=
his title is followed by the=20

declaration he the inquest.  _In Massachusetts Office of Coroner Abolished.=
_=E2=80=94Indeed, in=20

Massachusetts the office of coroner was abolished in 1877, and the governor=
 was invested with=20

power, and it is his duty, to appoint, by and with the advice and consent o=
f the council, able and=20

discreet men, learned in the science of medicine, to be medical examiners, =
whose duties are to=20

make examinations as provided in the statute upon the view of the dead bodi=
es of such persons=20

only as are supposed to have come to their death by violence.[524]  _Corone=
r may Employ=20

Professional Skill._=E2=80=94A thorough examination aided by professional s=
kill is in general absolutely=20

necessary to the proper administration of justice. It would no doubt be str=
ange if a coroner had no=20

authority to pledge the responsibility of the county for the compensation o=
f all auxiliary services=20

which are necessary to the proper execution of his office, and which he can=
 by no other means=20

command; for instance, when his duty requires=20


_
the king made to the ambassadors who had presented it to him.=E2=80=94Now, =
can it be conceived that=20

Monstrelet would have been silent as to the object of the assembly of noble=
s? or not have named=20

some of those who had been present? and that, after having mentioned Nevers=
 as the place of=20

meeting, he should have passed over every circumstance respecting it, to th=
e declarations and=20

resolutions that had there been determined upon? There are two reasons for =
concluding that part=20

of this chapter must be wanting: first, when Monstrelet returns to his narr=
ation, after having related=20

the king=E2=80=99s answer to the assembled lords, he speaks as having befor=
e mentioned them, =E2=80=98the=20

aforesaid lords,=E2=80=99 and I have just noticed that he names none of the=
m; secondly, when in the next=20

chapter he relates the expedition to Tartas, which was to decide on the fat=
e of Guienne, as having=20

before mentioned it, =E2=80=98of which notice has been taken in another pla=
ce,=E2=80=99 it must have been in the=20

preceding chapter,=E2=80=94but it is not there spoken of, nor in any other =
place.  =E2=80=98If the numerous=20

imperfections of Monstrelet are not made amends for, as I have said, by the=
 beauty of his style, we=20

must allow that they are compensated by advantages of another kind. His nar=
ration is diffuse, but=20

clear,=E2=80=94and his style heavy, but always equal. He rarely offers any =
reflections,=E2=80=94and they are=20

always short and he cannot be expected to do it with his own hands, or by h=
ands paid for with his=20

means. Indeed it has been said that, in this enlightened age, a coroner who=
 would consign to the=20

grave the body over which he had held an inquest, without availing himself =
of the lights which the=20

medical science has placed within his reach, would in most cases fall short=
 of what his official duty=20

requires.[525] It is the generally accepted view of the law now that it is =
the duty of a coroner=20

holding an inquest _super visum corporis_ to avail himself of professional =
skill and aid, and his=20

contract will bind the county to the payment of a reasonable compensation f=
or making a post-

mortem examination.[526]   POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION.  Whether such examinati=
on should=20

take place before the coroner has empanelled a jury seems to be an open que=
stion. We would=20

venture the opinion that it should not, inasmuch as the jury ought to see a=
nd view the body in the=20

same condition, as near as may be, as it was when found, and not after it h=
as been mutilated, as it=20

must need be by a post-mortem examination. It is, however, settled that the=
 post mortem should=20

not be in the presence of the jury, and that they are to be instructed by t=
he testimony of the=20

physicians who are designated by the coroner to make the examination.[527] =
The coroner=E2=80=99s right=20

to dissect the dead body of a human=20


_
mind is particularly manifested by the circumstance that we do not find in =
his work any ridiculous=20

stories of sorcery, magic, astrology, or any of those absurd prodigies whic=
h disgrace the greater=20

part of the historians of his time. The goodness of his heart also displays=
 itself in the traits of=20

sensibility which he discovers in his recitals of battles, sieges, and of t=
owns won by storm: he=20

seems then to rise superior to himself,=E2=80=94and his style acquires stre=
ngth and warmth. When he=20

relates the Such a power could be wielded with the most injurious effects u=
pon a community. His=20

power to dissect is confined to those cases where he is authorized by law t=
o hold an inquest upon=20

the body. But a post-mortem examination, conducted by surgeons employed by =
a coroner holding=20

an inquest, is not a part of the inquest in such a sense as that every citi=
zen has a right freely to=20

attend it. At common law it was essential to the validity of a coroner=E2=
=80=99s inquisition that the jury=20

should view the body. And so is=20


_
sentiment is to deplore the evils by which he foresees that the poorer rank=
s will soon be=20

overwhelmed. Whilst he paints the despair of the wretched inhabitants of th=
e country, pillaged and=20

massacred by both sides, we perceive that he is really affected by his subj=
ect, and writes from his=20

feelings. The writer of the cordelier register and the abbot of St Aubert, =
have not, therefore, said=20

too much, when they called him, =E2=80=98a very honest and peaceable man.=
=E2=80=99 It appears, in fact, should be=20

dissected in any case. It is discretionary with the coroner to cause a diss=
ection to be made, and to=20

select the surgeons. He has also a discretion to determine whether any pers=
on, and what persons,=20

may be present besides the surgeons. Not even the jurors have a right to wi=
tness the examination.=20

They are to be informed of what it discloses by the testimony of the surgeo=
ns. Indeed, no person=20

has a right to be present at the post-mortem examination upon the ground=20
