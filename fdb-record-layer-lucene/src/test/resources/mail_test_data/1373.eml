Moreover, what is to become o' _
joyless greeting of boon-companions, or the hoarse cough of some wretched consumptive would 

wake the dormant echoes that lingered in the gloom.   II  Martin-Roget knew his way about the 

murky street well enough. He went up to the house which lay a little back from the others. It 

appeared even more squalid than the rest, not a sound came from within--hardly a light--only a 

narrow glimmer found its way through the chink of a shutter on the floor above. To right and left of 

it the houses were tall, with walls that reeked of damp and of filth: from one of these--the one on 

the left--an iron sign dangled and creaked dismally as it swung in the wind. Just above the sign 

there was a window with partially closed shutters: through it came the sound of two husky voices 

raised in heated argument.  In the open space in front of Louise Adet's house vague forms 

standing about or lounging against the walls of the neighbouring houses were vaguely discernible 

in the gloom. Martin-Roget and Chauvelin as they approached were challenged by a raucous 

voice which came to them out of the inky blackness around.  "Halt! who goes there?"  "Friends!" 

replied Martin-Roget promptly. "Is citizeness Adet within?"  "Yes! she is!" retorted the man bluntly; 

"excuse me, friend Adet--I did not know you in this confounded darkness."  "No harm done," said 

Martin-Roget. "And it is I who am grateful to you all for your vigilance."  "Oh!" said the other with a 

laugh, "there's not much fear of your bird getting out of its cage. Have no fear, friend Adet! That 

Kernogan rabble is well looked after."  The small group dispersed in the darkness and Martin-

Roget rapped against the door of his sister's house with his knuckles.  "That is the Rat Mort," he 

said, indicating the building on his left with a nod of the head. "A very unpleasant neighbourhood 

for my sister, and she has oft complained of it--but name of a dog! won't it prove useful this night?" 

Chauvelin had as usual followed his colleague in silence, but his keen eyes had not failed to note 

the presence of the village lads of whom Martin-Roget had spoken. There are no eyes so watchful 

as those of hate, nor is there aught so incorruptible. Every one of these men here had an old 

wrong to avenge, an old score to settle with those ci-devant Kernogans who had once been their 

masters and who were so completely in their power now. Louise Adet had gathered round her a 

far more efficient bodyguard than even the proconsul could hope to have.  A moment or two later 

the door was opened, softly and cautiously, and Martin-Roget asked: "Is that you, Louise?" for of a 

truth the darkness was almost deeper within than without, and he could not see who it was that 

was standing by the door.  "Yes! it is," replied a weary and querulous voice. "Enter quickly. The 

wind is cruel, and I can't keep myself warm. Who is with you, Pierre?"  "A friend," said Martin-

Roget country as the "Water-rat."  When, therefore, he plunged into the river, as described, he 

took care to hold his breath as if for a long dive, and drifted with the current a considerable 

distance as motionless as a dead man.  The Indians listened intently, of course; for his coming to 

the surface; for the breathing, and, it might be, for the splashing that would be natural after such a 

leap, but no breathing or splashing met their ears, for when Fergus put up his head, far down the 

stream, he only let out his nose and mouth for a gentle inspiration, and sank again.  "It iss 

circumventin' you at your own trade, fightin' you wi' your own claymore, that I will be doin'," he 

thought, as he rose a second time, and swam softly with the stream.  Fergus had the advantage of 

being well acquainted with the river in which he was swimming, as well as with the lands in its 

neighbourhood, and he knew that there was a certain bend in the stream which it would take the 

canoe of Okematan a considerable time to traverse.  By cutting across a narrow neck of land there 

was, therefore, a possibility of his intercepting the canoe.  The Saulteaux, of course, might have 



also taken advantage of this circumstance, but they could have done so only on foot, and they 

knew that without canoes they could not arrest the progress of the fugitives.  Reaching the spot 

where he wished to land, by intuition almost, the Highlander soon found himself on the bank, 

squeezed the water out of his garments, and set off as quickly as he dared in such darkness.  By 

good fortune he happened to cross a hunter's track or path--like a sheep-run--with which he was 

familiar, and, by following it, was able to advance much more rapidly.  In a short time he again 

came out on the left bank of the river.  There he sat down on a boulder to listen. Profound was his 

attention to every sound--as profound, almost, as his anxiety, for he knew that if the canoe should 

have already passed he would be obliged to make his way back to the Settlement on foot by a 

straight course, which meant a slow, toilsome march, scrambling through pathless woods, wading 

morasses, and swimming across rivers.  He had been seated thus for about half-an-hour, and in 

his impatience was giving way to despondency, when the plash of water smote upon his ear. 

Cocking the said ear attentively, he was rewarded with another smite, and, in a few minutes, 

distinctly heard the sound of paddles.  He put his hands to his mouth forthwith, and uttered a 

peculiar cry.  Instantly the sound of the paddles ceased as Archie Sinclair, looking over his 

shoulder, said--  "Did you hear that, Oke?"  Before Oke could reply, the cry was repeated.  "It is 

Fer-gus," said the Indian, answering to the cry, and steering in the direction whence it came.  "Are 

you sure, Oke?"  "Okematan never speaks till he is sure--waugh!"  "H'm!  I'm not so sure o' 

_that_," muttered the

The woman without further comment closed the door behind the new-comers. The place now was 

as dark as pitch, but she seemed to know her way about like a cat, for her shuffling footsteps were 

heard moving about unerringly. A moment or two later she opened another door opposite the front 

entrance, revealing an inner room--a sort of kitchen--which was lighted by a small lamp.  "You can 

go straight up," she called curtly to the two men.  The narrow, winding staircase was divided from 

this kitchen by a wooden partition. Martin-Roget, closely followed by Chauvelin, went up the stairs. 

On the top of these there was a tiny landing with a door on either side of it. Martin-Roget without 

any ceremony pushed open the door on his right with his foot.  A tallow candle fixed in a bottle and 

placed in the centre of a table in the middle of the room flickered in the draught as the door flew 

open. It was  A few seconds put the matter at rest, for the voice of the Highlander was heard, as 

they cautiously drew near, saying--  "Iss it _you_?"  "I think it is!" replied Archie; "why, man, where 

are you?  I can see nothing."  "Wow! man, but I am gled," said Fergus; "just follow your nose, 

Archie, an' you'll be all right."  Another moment, and the canoe was checked by Fergus, who had 

stepped into the water to prevent its being injured against the stones.  "You better gie me the 

paddle, Archie, an' sit beside Little Bill.  It iss tired o' paddlin' you will be by now."  "But where is 

Dan?" asked Archie as he complied with this request.  "That iss more than I can tell you, boy, but 

he's safe enough I doubt not, for I heard him gie a cheer as he jamp into the wuds, an' it's beyont 

the power o' a mortal Red-skin to chase an active man on a night like this."  Thereupon Fergus 

gave a brief account of 


_
straw in one corner. The tiny window at right angles to the door was innocent of glass, and the 

north-westerly wind came in an icy stream through the aperture. On the table, in addition to the 

candle, there was a broken pitcher half-filled with water, and a small chunk of brown bread 

blotched with stains of mould.  On the chair beside the table and immediately facing the door sat 

Yvonne Lady Dewhurst. On the wall above her head a hand unused to calligraphy had traced in 

clumsy characters the words: "Liberte! Fraternite! Egalite!" and below that "ou la canoes were 

parted--as far as he knew it--and then an earnest council of war was held as to what was the best 

course to pursue in the circumstances.  Being the youngest brave, (for Little Bill was ignored in 

this matter), Archie was invited to give his opinion first.  This was well, because, being enthusiastic 

and irrepressible, he would probably have given his opinion first at any rate.  "My opinion is," he 

said, promptly, "that we turn right-about, and go back to find Dan, even though we should have to 

fight the whole Saulteaux nation!"  "That iss well
