"Yes," admitted Nat; "but I don't believe it's a bird."  "Me either," came from Sam. "But what is it?" 

"Let's look at the marks a little more carefully," proposed Jack.  "Several men have been here, 

struggling with the--the--er--whatever it was," spoke Will. "See the different footprints."  That much 

was evident. In addition to the man with the mark on his shoes of the arrow in hobnails, there were 

I was preaching in British Columbia some years ago, and a young man came to me, and wanted 

to become a Christian. He had been smuggling opium into the States.  "Well, my friend," I said, "I 

don't think there is any chance for you to become a Christian until you make restitution." He said, 

"If I attempt to do that, I will fall into the clutches of the law, and I will go to the penitentiary." "Well,"

individuals.  "And if this isn't the mark of a big bird's wing, I'll eat a pair of snowshoes!" exclaimed 

Nat suddenly. "Look here, fellows!"  They hurried to where he was. There in the snow was the 

unmistakable print of what seemed to be a wing of a great creature of the air.  "And here's another 

wing," added Sam a little later as he walked slowly over the level place. "But they're some 

distance apart."  "I should say so," agreed Jack. "Sixty feet, if they're an inch."  "But the marks are 

those of two wings, and they were made at the same time," went on Sam. "Look, you can see 

where the body comes between the wings. The bird was over on its back. That happened when 

they tried to secure it."  "But sixty feet," objected Nat. "There's no bird living with a spread of wings 

like that. It's out of the question."  "Here's the evidence," spoke Sam obstinately. "You can see for 

yourself."  "Sixty feet spread," murmured Jack. "It doesn't seem possible."  But there was no doubt 

but that the marks in the snow were those of wings, and, as Jack paced the distance from tip to 

tip, they proved to be over sixty feet apart.  "Maybe the men have discovered some prehistoric 

monster," suggested Will, "and are trying to subdue it so they can exhibit it. There used to be 

monsters as large as the marks left by this thing, whatever it is."  "Yes," admitted Jack; "but they 

disappeared from the earth ages ago. Only that than go to the judgment-seat of God with that sin 

upon your soul, and have eternal punishment. The Lord will be very merciful if you set your face to 

do right."  He went away sorrowful, but came back the next day, and said: "I have a young wife 

and child, and all the furniture in my house I have bought with money I have got in this dishonest 

way. If I become a Christian, that furniture will have to go, and my wife will know it." "Better let your 

wife know it, and better let your home and furniture go." "Would you come up and see my wife?" 

he asked; "I don't know what she will say."  I went up to see her, and when I told her, the tears 

trickled down her cheeks, and she said: "Mr. Moody, I will gladly give everything if my husband 

can become a true Christian."  She took out her pocketbook, and handed over her last penny. He 

had a piece of land in the United States, which he deeded over to the government. I do not know 

in all my backward track of any living man who has had a better testimony for Jesus Christ than 

that man. He had been dishonest, but when the truth came to him that he must make it right 

before God would help him, he made it right and then God used him wonderfully.  No amount of 

weeping over sin, and saying that you feel sorry, is going to help it unless you are willing to 

confess, and make restitution.    Ninth Commandment  "Thou shalt not bear false witness against

"But might one not be alive, by chance, in some big mountain cave?" asked Nat.  "I don't know," 

spoke Jack with a worried look. "It has me puzzled, fellows. I don't know what to think."  "Let's go 

back to camp, tell Long Gun about it, and bring him here to-morrow to see it," suggested Sam. 

"Long Gun would never come," said Jack. "He's too much afraid of bad spirits. No, boys, we'll 

have to solve this ourselves, if it's to be solved at all."  The  Two out of the Ten Commandments 

deal with sins that find expression by the tongue--the third commandment, which forbids taking 

God's name in vain, and this ninth commandment, which forbids false witness against our 

neighbor. This two-fold prohibition ought to impress us as a solemn warning, especially as we find 

that the pages of Scripture are full of condemnation of sins of the tongue. The Psalms, Proverbs 

and the epistle of James deal largely
