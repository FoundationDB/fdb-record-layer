directness of her look; he no longer wished that she would sit the other wa=
y, and attend to the tops=20

of the salmon-rods.  As for their speech together, the exceeding frankness =
of it and lack of=20

conventionality arose from one or two causes, but no doubt partly from this=
--that during their=20

various adventures on the loch there was no time for the observance of stud=
ied forms.  It was 'Do=20

this' and 'Do that,' on his part--sometimes with even a sharp word of monit=
ion; and with her it was=20

'Will that do, Ronald?' or again,--when she was standing up in fell encount=
er with her unseen=20

enemy, both hands engaged with the rod--'Ronald, tie my cap down, or the wi=
nd will blow it away--

No, no, the other strings--underneath!'  Indeed, on the morning after the e=
vening on which they=20

had been urging him to make a career for himself, there was not much chance=
 of any calm=20

discussion of that subject.  The proceedings of the day opened in a remarka=
bly lively manner.  For=20

one thing the wind had backed still farther during the night, and was now b=
lowing briskly from the=20

north, bringing with it from time to time smart snow showers that blackened=
 the heavens and earth=20

for a few minutes and then sped on, leaving the peaks and shoulders and eve=
n the lower spurs of=20

the hills all a gleaming white in the wintry sunlight.  'Salmon-fishing in =
a snow-storm--well, I=20

declare!' said she, as she stood on the shore of the lake, watching him put=
ting the rods together.=20

'The very best time,' said he, in his positive way (for he had assumed a ki=
nd of authority over her,=20

whereas with Meenie he was always reserved and distant and timidly gentle).=
  'None better.  I=20

would just like to find a foot of snow on the ground, right down to the edg=
e of the loch; and the=20

flakes falling so thick ye couldna see a dozen yards ahead of ye.'  'Do you=
 know where I should be=20

then?' she retorted. 'I should be warming my toes in front of Mrs. Murray's=
 peat-fire.'  'Not one bit,'=20

said he, just as positively.  'If ye heard the salmon were taking, ye'd be =
down here fast enough, I'm=20

thinking.'  And presently it seemed as if this early start of theirs was to=
 be rewarded, for scarcely=20

were both lines out--and Miss Carry was just settling herself down for a li=
ttle quiet talk, and was=20

pulling the collar of her ulster higher over her ears (for the wind was som=
ewhat cold)--when a=20

sudden tugging and straining at one of the rods, followed by a sharp scream=
 of the reel, upset all=20

these little plans.  She made a dash at the rod and raised it quickly.  'Th=
at's a good fish--that's a=20

good fish!' Ronald cried, with his mouth set hard.  'Now let's see if we ca=
nna hold on to this one.=20

Let him go, lassie!--I beg your pardon--let him go--let him go--that's righ=
t--a clean fish, and a=20

beauty!'  Beauty or no, the salmon had no hesitation about showing himself,=
 at least; for now he=20

began to lash the surface of the water, some fifty yards away, not springin=
g into the air, but merely=20

beating the waves with head and body and tail to get rid of this unholy thi=
ng that he had pursued=20

and gripped.  Then down he went with a mighty plunge--the reel whirring out=
 its shrill cry, and Miss=20

Carry's gloves suffering in consequence--and there he sulked; so that they =
backed the boat again,=20

and again she got in some of the line.  What was the sound that came across=
 the lake to them, in=20

the face of the northerly wind?  'They're waving a handkerchief to ye, Miss=
 Hodson,' said he, 'from=20

the other boat.'  'Oh, bother,' said she (for the strain of a heavy salmon =
and forty yards of line was=20

something on her arms), 'here, take the handkerchief from this breast-pocke=
t, and wave it back to=20

them--stand up beside me--they won't see the difference----'  He did as he =
was bid; apparently she=20

paid little attention; she seemed wholly bent on getting the fish.  And cle=
arly the salmon had=20

somewhat exhausted himself with his first escapades; he now lay deep=20

twenty yards out: then they waited.  And meanwhile this strange thing that =
was overtaking them?=20

The bright, windy, changeable day--with its gleaming snow-slopes and sunlit=
 straths and woods=20

darkened by passing shadows--seemed to be slowly receding from them, and ar=
ound them came=20

a kind of hushed and stealthy gloom.  And then the wind stirred again; the =
gusts came sharper and=20

colder; here and there a wet particle stung the cheek or the back of the ha=
nd.  Of course, she was=20

in a death-struggle with a salmon; she could not heed. And presently the ga=
thering blackness all=20

around seemed to break into a soft bewilderment of snow; large, soft, wooll=
y flakes came driving=20

along before the wind; all the world was shut out from them; they could see=
 nothing but a short=20

space of livid dark water, and feel nothing but this choking silent thing i=

_
[Illustration: The Little Island Among the Marshes]     MONEY ISLAND.   Thi=
s is the story of the=20

buried treasure on Money Island, which lies in Greenville Sound, not far fr=
om Wilmington, North=20

Carolina. It was told by Mr. Jonathan Landstone many years ago, and is a pa=
rt of another story=20

which follows, and which will explain something further about the mysteriou=
s little island that blinks=20

in the sunlight and tries to hide its secret. The words are Mr. Landstone's=
 and were written by him,=20

to make sure that the story would be told correctly when the time came to p=
ublish it.   (Mr.=20

Landstone's MS.)  My grandfather lived in Charleston, S.C. My home is in Ph=
iladelphia. In my=20

boyhood I visited him several times. He was a fine old man, and was very fo=
nd of me. He used to=20

tell me many stories of the good old colonial days. He said his father was =
a pirate; but that pirates=20

in those days were gentlemen. Although they made game of the King's revenue=
 on the high seas,=20

it was regarded as nothing very wrong; and, although they played havoc with=
 the Spanish=20

shipping, it was but the assertion of a time-honored right of Englishmen, w=
ho never did love=20

Spaniards. They were, many of them, ingloriously hanged, it is true, but it=
 was by the King's=20

officers, and not by the people.  However, not to defend pirates, or indeed=
 to condemn them, I will=20

tell you what my grandfather narrated about his father, who was Capt. John =
Redfield. He was a=20

gallant seaman, who consorted with Charles Vane and other doughty corsairs =
of those days of=20

romance upon the seas.  When Captain Kidd forsook the King's commission to =
run down the=20

pirates on the American coast, and organized his formidable squadron, Capta=
in Redfield was=20

chosen as his trusted counsellor, to accompany the brilliant leader on his =
adventures. He gave up=20

his own ship, and was with Captain Kidd on many voyages, being entrusted wi=
th many a=20

commission of rapidity, the heavens and the earth seemed to open above and =
around them; the=20

clouds swept on; there was a great deep of dazzling blue suddenly revealed =
in the sky overhead;=20

and all the dancing waters of the lake, from the boat to the farthest shore=
s, were one flashing and=20

lapping mass of keen, pure cobalt, absolutely bewildering to the eyes. The =
joy of that radiant=20

colour, after the mystery and the darkness!  And then the sunlight broke ou=
t; and Clebrig had a=20

touch of gold along his mighty shoulders; and Ben Loyal's snow-slopes were =
white against the=20

brilliant blue; and it seemed as if the fairest of soft summer skies were s=
hining over Bonnie Strath-

Naver.  To her it meant that she could see a little more clearly. She shook=
 the snowflakes from her=20

hair.  'Ronald, you are sure it is not a kelt?'  'Indeed I am.  There's not=
hing of the kelt about that=20

one.'  'If it is,' said she, 'I'll go home and tell my ma.'  She was clearl=
y feeling a little more secure=20

about this one.  And she did capture the creature in the end, though it was=
 after a long and=20

arduous struggle.  For he was a strong fish--fresh run up from the sea, and=
 heavy for his size; and=20

again and again, and a dozen times repeated, he would make rushes away from=
 the boat just as=20

they thought he was finally showing the white feather.  It was the toughest=
 fight she had had; but=20

practice was hardening her muscles a little; and she had acquired a little =
dexterity in altering her=20

position and shifting the strain.  By this time the other boat was coming r=
ound.  'Stick to him,=20

Carry!' her father cried.  'No Secesh tactics allowed: hold on to him!'  Th=
e next moment Ronald=20

had settled all that by a smart scoop of the clip; and there in the bottom =
of the boat lay a small-

headed deep-shouldered fish of just over sixteen pounds--Ronald pinning him=
 down to get the=20

minnow out of his jaw, and the lad Johnnie grinning all over his ruddy=20


_
One fine spring morning, while off the Carolina coast, Captain Kidd was pac=
ing his deck, enjoying=20

the warm splendor of the early sunshine. He had just returned from a succes=
sful voyage among=20

the Spanish colonies of the south, and was gaily attired after the manner o=
f a Spanish cavalier. He=20

wore a cocked hat, decked with a yellow band and a black plume, and a coat =
of black velvet which=20

reached down to his knees. His trousers were blue, and were adorned by larg=
e golden knee-

buckles. He  Miss Carry looked on in a very calm and business-like fashion;=
 though in reality her=20

heart was beating quickly--with gladness and exultation. And then, with the=
 same business-like=20

calmness, she took from the deep pocket of her ulster a flask that she had =
borrowed from Mr.=20

Murray.  'Ronald,' said she, 'you must drink to our good luck.'  She handed=
 him the flask.  She=20

appeared to be quite to the manner born now.  You would not have imagined t=
hat her heart was=20

beating so quickly, or her=20
