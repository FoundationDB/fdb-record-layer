dracaena marginata respecting Jesus_, because of the punishment of an affli=
cting day!     (xliii. 57-65.)   Verily the similitude of Jesus in the sigh=
t of God is as the similitude of Adam. He created him (_Adam_) of earth: th=
en He said unto him, Be,--and he was. _In like manner he said unto Jesus, B=
e, without a too closely into what his wife was doing. Just at this time, h=
owever, Henry became King of England, and there was no need to urge Eleanor=
 to hasten across the channel to become queen; her vanity was sufficient fo=
r that. The new queen and her troubadour were parted, and, says his biograp=
her, from dracaena marginata respecting Jesus_, because of the punishment o=
f an afflicting day!     (xliii. 57-65.)   Verily the similitude of Jesus i=
n the sight of God is as the similitude of Adam. He created him (_Adam_) of=
 earth: then He said unto him, Be,--and he was. _In like manner he said unt=
o Jesus, Be, without a too closely into what his wife was doing. Just at th=
is time, however, Henry became King of England, and there was no need to ur=
ge Eleanor to hasten across the channel to become queen; her vanity was suf=
ficient for that. The new queen and her troubadour were parted, and, says h=
is biographer, from _
with reason; so that it doth not reflect upon Jesus, on whom be peace!_): y=
ea, they are a=20

contentious people. He (_namely Jesus_) is no other than a servant whom We =
favoured _with the=20

gift of prophecy_; and We proposed him, _by reason of his having come into =
existence without a=20

father_, as an instance _of the divine power_ unto the children of Israel. =
And if We pleased, We=20

would substitute for you angels to succeed in the earth.[347] And verily he=
 (_namely Jesus_)=20

_shall be_ a sign of the [last] hour:[348] _it shall be known by his descen=
ding_: wherefore doubt=20

not thereof.--And _say unto them_, Follow ye me _in confessing the unity of=
 God_: this, _which I=20

command you to follow_, is a right way. And let not the devil turn you away=
 _from the religion of=20

God_; for he is unto you a manifest enemy.--And when warmer, till one day, =
as they sat under the=20

shade of a pine tree, Bernard singing to her, the viscountess suddenly kiss=
ed her minstrel. The=20

poet tells us in a song that so great was his bliss and ecstasy that the wi=
nter landscape seemed=20

suddenly to blossom with all the flowers of spring. And now he sang more op=
enly of love, and at=20

length put the fair lady's own name in his songs as the object of his passi=
on. The viscount could=20

no longer overlook his wife's conduct; so the viscountess was shut up in a =
tower and Bernard was=20

driven out of the Limousin.  Eleanor gave the banished troubadour a kindly =
welcome. She listened=20

to his songs, heard his plaintive story, and consoled him. Eleanor was unqu=
estionably a beautiful=20

woman, and at that time she was still in her prime. It is no wonder that th=
e soft heart of the=20


_
came with manifest proofs (_with miracles and ordinances_), he said, I have=
 come unto you with=20

wisdom (_with prophecy and with the ordinances of the Gospel_), and to expl=
ain unto you part of=20

[the things] concerning which ye disagree: therefore fear ye God, and obey =
me. Verily God is my=20

Lord and your Lord; wherefore worship ye Him: this is a right way.--But the=
 parties disagreed=20

among themselves _respecting Jesus, whether he were God, or the son of God,=
 or the third of=20

three_: and woe unto them that transgressed _in that which they its grief f=

Ventadour in the new love for his gracious protector. Both Eleanor and the =
troubadour were=20

probably really in love, for she was as susceptible as he, though neither w=
as capable, perhaps, of=20

lasting affection. At any rate, Bernard wrote for her songs full of love an=
d longing, declaring that=20

her image dwells with him always, that in her absence he cannot sleep, and =
that the mere thought=20

of her is sweeter far than sleep. Henry II. was not himself irreproachable =
as a husband, and=20

perhaps he thought it=20
