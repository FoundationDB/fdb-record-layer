l 50 states of the United=20

States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerabl=
e effort, much=20

paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do=
 not solicit=20

donations in wash and scour it with Salt, and the Curd likewise, as directe=
d above; and then=20

salting it very well, hang it up in the Corner of a Kitchen Chimney, and dr=
y it; and as soon as you=20

want to use it, boil Water and Salt, as before, and fill the Bag with it, m=
aking small Holes in the=20

Bag, as before directed, and keeping it in a clean Pan.  It is to be noted,=
 that the Bag of the Calf,=20

which is the part that receives the Milk, is so disposed, as to change the =
Milk into Curd, as soon as=20

it is received into it; and the Curd, which is found in it, partaking of th=
at quality of the Bag, which=20

disposes it to harden the Milk; these are therefore to be preserv'd for the=
 same use, when we=20

employ common Milk to be made into Curd: but as the Calves Bag is warm, whe=
n it naturally=20

receives the Milk from the Cow, and it then curdles in it; so, when we want=
 to set or turn Milk, for=20

Cheese or other use, we must have the Milk warm as one may guess the Body o=
f the Calf was,=20

and the Milk was likewise, when the Calf receiv'd it from the Cow. There is=
 great danger if the Milk=20

be too hot when the Rennet is put to it, for then it sets or turns to Curd =
very quick, and the Cheese=20

will be hard; but it is good to let the Milk be of such a warmth as not to =
come too soon, as it is=20

called in the Dairies, but to have it of such a warmth, as to let the Curd =
set easily, and come=20

moderately, for the quicker the Curd comes, the harder it is, and the harde=
r the Curd is, the harder=20

is the Cheese. Again, we must have some regard to the Pasture where our Cow=
s feed; those that=20



feed in rank Grass have more watery parts in their Milk than those Cows whi=
ch feed on short=20

Grass: and sometimes, as I have observed before, in my other Works, the Cow=
s feed upon Crow=20

Garlick, or the Alliaria, or Sauce alone, or Jack in the Hedge, or Goose-gr=
ass, or Clivers, or=20

Rennet Wort, and their Milk will either be ill tasted, or else turn or curd=
 of itself, altho' the Cow has=20

had a due time after Calving; and if the Goose-grass or Clivers happen to b=
e the occasion of the=20

turning of the Milk, then a less quantity of Rennet should be used: for the=
 only use of Rennet is to=20

fix the Milk, and turn it to Curd, and if already there is near an equivale=
nt for Rennet in the Milk, by=20

the Cow's eating such Herbs, then a little of it will do. But as I have obs=
erv'd above, where Cattle=20

feed upon long rank Grass, the Milk is watery, and does not contain two thi=
rds of the Cream, or=20

Richness that there is in the same quantity of Milk from Cows fed upon shor=
t fine Grass: So that if=20

one was to make Cheese, one would chuse the Milk of Cows that fed upon the =
purest fine Grass.=20

Here the Milk would be rich, and if the Rennet is good and well proportion'=
d, the Cheese will be so=20

too. It is to be observ'd likewise, that when Cows feed upon such Weeds as =
I have mention'd, I=20

mean the Clivers, which turn their Milk, the Curd is always hard and scatte=
r'd, and never comes=20

into a Body, as the pure Milk will do that is set with Rennet, and conseque=
ntly the Cheese will be=20

hard. There is one thing likewise to be taken notice of, with regard to the=
 Rennet, that as the Bag,=20

of which it is made, happens to be good, so is the Rennet good in proportio=
n. I mean the Bag is=20

good when the Milk of the Cow, that suckled the Calf, is good; for the good=
ness of the Feed of the=20

Cow does not only dispose the Body of the Calf to produce a gentleness or s=
oftness in the Acid,=20

which promotes the curdling of the Milk, when it is received into the Body =
of the Calf, but makes=20

the Rennet more tender to the setting of the Cheese-Curd, and so the Cheese=
 will consequently=20

be the better for it: And I judge that one reason why the _Suffolk_ Cheese =
is so much noted for its=20

hardness, is on account of the badness of the Rennet, tho' it is certain, t=
hat the worst Cheeses of=20

that Country are made of Skim-Milk; however, the nature of the Milk is such=
, according to my=20

Observation, that it makes very rich Butter, but the Cream rises on it so q=
uickly, and so=20

substantially, that it leaves no fatness or richness in the other part, whi=
ch we call the Skim-Milk,=20

but that remains little better than Water: so that 'tis no wonder in this c=
ase, and thro' the rank Feed=20

of the Cows, that the Cheeses of those parts are not good. I think however =
the Cheese of=20

_Suffolk_ might be help'd in a good measure, if the Farmers there were to h=
ave their Rennet Bags=20

from places where the Grass was short and fine; for I guess then, from the =
above reasoning, that=20

the Curd would be of a more tender nature, or not of so binding a quality a=
s it now is, and the=20

Cheese consequently would be the better. But besides the goodness of the Mi=
lk and the Rennet, if=20

a Cheese is over press'd, it will be hard and unpleasant; but it is to be r=
emark'd, that all Cheeses=20

that are hard press'd will keep longer than those that are gently press'd, =
and bear transporting=20

thro' the hottest Climates, which the more tender-made Cheeses will not wit=
hout corrupting, unless=20

they are put into Oil. There is one thing which I may observe particularly,=
 relating to the Rennet=20

Bag; which is, that the Calf should suck it full about an hour before it is=
 kill'd, that there may be=20

more and fresher Curd in it; tho' in the killing of Calves it is a Rule to =
let the Calf fast some time=20

before killing, which we are told contributes to the Whiteness of the Flesh=
. Again, it would be an=20

advantage in the making of Cheese to have your Cattle all of one sort, and =
to feed all upon the=20

same sort of Pasture; for when it happens to be otherwise, the Cheeses are =
apt to decay, from the=20

different Tempers of the Milk; but let our Milk be what it will, be careful=
 of the former Method=20



prescribed, _i.e._ to break the Curd by gentle degrees, and as equally as p=
ossible every where:=20

the little pains extraordinary will be paid in the goodness of the Cheese, =
for then it will not be full of=20

Eyes or Hollows, and will sell the better.  But besides the way of preparin=
g the Rennet, as I have=20

here set down, it is practised to make an artificial Rennet, which will do =
very well for making of=20

Cheese; and that is, to boil the Cliver, or as some call it Goose-grass, or=
 others Rennet-Wort, in=20

Water, and you may add some Tops of Sweet Bryar; about a Spoonful of which =
Decoction, or=20

boiled Liquor, will turn a Pail-full of Milk, of about five Gallons, withou=
t any other help; but in the=20

Preparation of this, as well as the other, for the Improvement of the Chees=
es, in giving them rich=20

Flavours, it is adviseable to insert, while we are boiling the Waters for t=
hem, either some of such=20

Sweet Herbs as we like, or such Spices as we most covet the taste of. As fo=
r the famous _Stilton_=20

Cheese, which I have already published the Receipt of, we are to make the R=
ennet strong of=20

Mace, by boiling the Mace in the Salt and Water, for without that is done, =
the Cheese will not have=20

the true Relish that the first famous _Stilton_ Cheeses had; and without th=
e People of _Stilton_=20

keep up the antient way of making it, agreeable to the old Receipt, they mu=
st of necessity lose the=20

Reputation they have gain'd by their Cheeses. I shall not pretend to affirm=
 why the Cheeses now=20

in that Town are not generally so good as they were formerly; but perhaps i=
t is because some of=20

the Cheese-Sellers there depend upon the reputation of the first Cheeses, a=
nd now buy Cheeses=20

from other parts, where nothing of the true Receipt is known but the Figure=
. However, it would be=20

injustice in me if I did not take notice, that the Master of the _Blue-Bell=
 Inn_ in _Stilton_ provided=20

me with one that was excellent in its way, and yearly furnishes as many Cus=
tomers with them as=20

give him timely Notice: But as these Cheeses require time in the Dairy, bef=
ore they are fit for=20

eating, and the Season of making them is in the Bloom of the Year, so it is=
 necessary to speak for=20

them betimes, to have them to one's mind. I shall not give the Receipt of i=
t at this time, as it has=20

already fallen into a good number of hands with my former Pieces, and has b=
een thought good=20

enough to have been copied from me, with many other Articles, and published=
 by Mr. _Lawrence._=20

I shall proceed therefore to give the Receipts for making of some other kin=
ds of Cheeses, which=20

yet have not appear'd in the World, which I have collected from some of the=
 best Dairies in=20

_England._ The following is the famous _Buckingham_ Cheese, which I had fro=
m Mr. _Foord,_ a=20

very curious Gentleman of that place.    To make _Buckingham_ Cheese. From =
Mr. _Foord_ of=20

that Place.  Prepare a Cheese Vat or Cheese Mote of a square Figure, six In=
ches over, and nine=20

Inches deep, full of small Holes for the convenience of letting out the Whe=
y when the Curd is put=20

into it: Then take the Night's Cream, and mix it with the Morning's Milk, a=
nd put the Rennet to it to=20

cool. When the Curd is come, take it gently from the Whey, and fill the Che=
ese Vat with it, and lay=20

a Board up on the Curd, and as that sinks, fill up the Cheese Vat with fres=
h Curds; this should be=20

done once every Hour till Night. The next Day turn your Cheese upside down,=
 and continue=20

turning it every Night and Morning till it shrinks from the Vat or Cheese M=
ote, and is stiff enough to=20

take out without breaking, and then lay it upon the Shelf to be turn'd, and=
 shift it Night and Morning=20

till 'tis dry for use. This Mr. _Foord_ tells me is the best sort of Cheese=
 he has met with in=20

_England._  The following I have experienced to be an extraordinary Cheese;=
 in some places 'tis=20

call'd the Golden Cheese, and in others the Marygold Cheese, which it is pr=
operly. The Juice of=20

the Marygolds adds a very great richness to the Milk, and contributes almos=
t as much to it as=20

Cream would do. The following is the Receipt to make it.    To make Marygol=
d Cheese.  Gather=20



your Marygold Flowers in a dry Day, and pick the golden-colour'd Leaves fro=
m them, (these we=20

call the Petals of the Flowers:) As soon as you have pick'd a sufficient qu=
antity of these Leaves for=20

your use, bruise them in a Mortar, or grind them, if you have Conveniency, =
and strain out the=20

Juice; this Juice, when you put the Rennet to the Milk, must be put into th=
e Milk, and stirr'd into it.=20

The Milk must then be set, and as soon as the Curd is come, break it gently=
, and as equally as=20

possible, and put it into the Cheese Vat, and press it with a gentle Weight=
, letting the bottom part=20

for the making of Sage-Cheese, the following is the best way that I have me=

think the Receipt may be useful to the Publick.    To make a plain Sage-Che=

young Tops of red Sage, and bruise them in a Mortar till you can press the =
Juice from them; then=20

take Leaves of Spinach or Spinage, and bruise them likewise, and press out =
the Juice to mix with=20

the Sage Juice; for the Sage Juice of it self is not of a pleasant green Co=
lour, and the Spinach=20

Juice is added to it to render it more bright to the Sight; it also serves =
to take off the bitterness of=20

the Sage. When this Juice is prepared, put your Rennet to the Milk, and, at=
 the same time, mix as=20

much of your Sage and Spinach Juice with it, as will give the Milk the gree=
n Colour you desire. If=20

you would have it strong of the Sage, you must have the greater share of Sa=
ge Juice; or weaker of=20

the Sage, the greater share of Spinach Juice. When the Curd is come, break =
the Curd gently, and=20

when it is all equally broken, put it into the Vat or Cheese Mote,=20
