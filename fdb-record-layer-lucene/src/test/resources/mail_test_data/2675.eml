It is equally common to behold this same army of hunters trailing along at the close of the holiday, 

burdened with fish of many species, vari-colored fowl, or the hides of various game animals. 

Game birds are very prolific. Among the most prominent are the Chinese pheasant, bob white and 

California quail, Hungarian partridge, and native prairie chickens; all are found along the streams 

or in the clearings and fields of nearly every part of the state. Blue grouse are quite plentiful in 

western Washington and in the wooded sections of eastern Washington. Ruffled grouse are 

plentiful in the Okanogan Highlands and in several of the western counties. All species of ducks 

are to be found on Puget Sound and along the rivers and lakes tributary thereto, this morning she 

keeps on at me wi' her questions like the clapper o' a bell. 'Is she a servant? If she's no, why does 

she wear servants' claes? Why does she have hair like a boy? Has she had a fever or something 

wrong wi' her heid? Is she one of they suffragette buddies and been in prison?'--till I was fair 

deeved and bade the lassie hold her tongue. But so it will be wherever Miss Morton goes in they 

fantastic claes. Now, Miss Jan, tell me the honest truth--did you ever see a self-respecting, 

respectable servant in the like o' yon? Does she _look_ like any servant you've ever heard tell of 

out of a stage-play?"  "Not a bit, Hannah; she looks exactly like herself, and therefore not in the 

least like any other person. Don't you worry. Miss Morton

geese infest the Columbia and Snake river regions in eastern Washington.  [Illustration: THE 

ANGLER'S REWARD.  Photo by B. C. Collier]  Perhaps no state in the Union has as many 

varieties of real fighting trout as Washington; including especially the mountain, rainbow, cut 

throat, beardsley, crawford, lake, steel head, and eastern brook, in all lakes and mountain 

streams. Black bass and perch are very plentiful in the land-locked lakes; and certain sections 

produce also many varieties of white fish, sun fish, croppies and cat fish. The waters of Puget 

Sound, the harbors and the Columbia River contain many species of salmon.  The commonest no 

explanation. All we must do is to see that she doesn't overwork herself."  "Then ye'll no speak to 

her, Miss Jan?"  "Not I, Hannah. Why should I dictate to her as to what she wears? She doesn't 

dictate to me."  This was not strictly true, for Meg was most interfering in the matter of Jan's 

clothes. Hannah shook her head. "I thocht it my duty to speak, Miss Jan, and I'll say no more. But 

it's sheer defiance o' her Maker to crop her heid and to clothe herself in whim-whams, when she 

could be dressed like a lady; and I'm real vexed she should make such an object of herself when 

she might just be quite unnoticeable, sae wee and shelpit as
