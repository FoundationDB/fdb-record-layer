of the carnival that any one at the Villa Camellia had recognized Lorna as =
a budding beauty.  "You=20

ought always to wear yellow," Peachy said to her afterwards. "It's quite yo=
ur color. By the by, who=20

chooses your clothes for you?"  "Miss Rodgers generally takes me to Naples =
and buys them."=20

"She's no taste. Her ideas run to a gym suit and a school panama and nothin=
g beyond. I'll give you=20

a tip. Next time you need an evening dress or a Sunday jumper, engineer it =
so Miss Morley does=20

the shopping. She'll get you something pretty, I'll guarantee. She chose th=
at blue _crepe de chine_=20

for Delia. Don't forget. And don't look so fearfully surprised. If you have=
n't thirty thousand piastres;=20

but its waters gush out in every street.  We returned from Porto Cabello to=
 the valleys of Aragua,=20

and stopped at the Farm of Barbula, near which, a new road to Valencia is i=
n the course of=20

construction. We had heard, several weeks before, of a tree, the sap of whi=
ch is a nourishing milk.=20

It is called the cow-tree; and we were assured that the negroes of the farm=
, who drink plentifully of=20

this vegetable milk, consider it a wholesome aliment. All the milky juices =
of plants being acrid,=20

bitter, and more or less poisonous, this account appeared to us very extrao=
rdinary; but we found=20

by experience during our stay at Barbula, that the=20


_
dear, you'll pay dressing. Come close and I'll whisper to you: some of thos=
e Stars are just too=20

jealous of you for words. I'm tickled to bits."     CHAPTER XI  Up Vesuvius=
   On a certain day=20

towards the end of March, Miss Morley, who usually acted as cicerone and ge=
neral guide,=20

arranged to take a select little party up Vesuvius. Irene, Lorna, Peachy, a=
nd Delia were among the=20

favored few, and congratulated themselves exceedingly. It is certainly not =
an every-day=20

occurrence for schoolgirls to view a volcano, and this particular excursion=
, being long and difficult,=20

was kept as a special treat, and was regarded as the titbit of the various =
expeditions from the Villa=20

Camellia. Many of the girls had, of course, made it on former occasions, bu=
t to those whom Miss=20

Morley was escorting to-day it was all new.  "I was to have gone last autum=
n," confided Peachy,=20

"but the fact is I got into a little fix with Miss Rodgers, and she started=
 on the rampage and=20

canceled my exeat. I cried till I was simply a sopping sponge, but she was =
a perfect crab that day.=20

Lorna, weren't you to have gone too once before?"  "Yes, and got toothache.=
 Just like my luck.=20

There the others were starting off, and I was sitting by the stove with a s=
wollen face, dabbing on=20

belladonna, and Miss Rodgers careering round telling me I must have it out.=
 Ugh! My ailments=20

always turn up when I'm going anywhere."  "Well, you're all right to-day at=
 any rate," consoled=20

Delia, rather unsympathetically.  "If I don't get seasick on the boat."  "O=
h, buck up! You mustn't.=20

We'll throw you overboard to the fishes if you do anything so silly. For go=
odness' sake=20

exaggerated. This fine tree rises like the broad-leaved star-apple.* (* Chr=
ysophyllum cainito.) Its=20

oblong and pointed leaves, rough and alternate, are marked by lateral ribs,=
 prominent at the lower=20

surface, and parallel. Some of them are ten inches long. We did not see the=
 flower: the fruit is=20

somewhat fleshy, and contains one and sometimes two nuts. When incisions ar=
e made in the=20

trunk of this tree, it yields abundance of a glutinous milk, tolerably thic=
k, devoid of all acridity, and=20

of an agreeable and balmy smell. It was offered to us in the shell of a cal=
abash. We drank=20

considerable quantities of it in the evening before we went to bed, and ver=
y early in the morning,=20

without feeling the least injurious effect. The viscosity of this milk alon=
e renders it a little=20

disagreeable. The negroes and the free people who work in the plantations d=
rink it, dipping into it=20

their bread of maize or cassava. The overseer of the farm told us that the =
negroes grow sensibly=20

fatter during the season when the palo de vaca furnishes them with most mil=
k. This juice, exposed=20

to the air, presents at its surface (perhaps in consequence of the absorpti=
on of the atmospheric=20

oxygen) membranes of a strongly animalized substance, yellowish, stringy, a=
nd resembling=20

cheese. These membranes, separated from the rest of the more aqueous liquid=
, are elastic,=20

almost like caoutchouc; but they undergo, in time, the same phenomena of pu=
trefaction as=20

gelatine. The people call the coagulum that separates by the contact of the=
 air, cheese. This=20

coagulum grows sour in the space of five or six days, as I observed in the =
small portions which I=20


_
symptoms and spoil the fun. Where's Miss Morley? I'm just aching to be off.=
"  The party left=20

Fossato by the early morning steamer and went straight to Naples. They drov=
e from the quay to=20

the station, then took the little local train for Vesuvius. Italian railway=
s generally provide scant=20

accommodation for the number of passengers, so there ensued a wild scramble=
 for seats, and it=20

was only by the help of the conductor, whom she had judiciously tipped, tha=
t Miss Morley=20

managed to keep her Valencia. The milk contained in a stopped phial, had de=
posited a little=20

coagulum; and, far from becoming fetid, it exhaled constantly a balsamic od=
our. The fresh juice=20

mixed with cold water was scarcely coagulated at all; but on the contact of=
 nitric acid the=20

separation of the viscous membranes took place. We sent two bottles of this=
 milk to M. Fourcroy at=20

Paris: in one it was in its natural state, and in the other, mixed with a c=
ertain quantity of carbonate=20

of soda. The French consul=20
