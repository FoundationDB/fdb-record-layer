which missionaries and the like are fond of bringing against the Muslim pra=
yers, that they are=20

merely lifeless forms and vain repetitions, is an exaggeration. There is a =
vast deal of repetition in=20

the Mohammadan ritual, just as the paternoster is repeated again and again =
in the principal=20

Christian liturgies; but iteration does not necessarily kill devotion. Ther=
e is plenty of real fervour in=20

the prayers of the Mosque, and they are joined-in by the worshippers with a=
n earnest attention=20

which shames the listless sleepy bearing of most congregations in England. =
It is true the greater=20

part of the prayers are laid down in prescribed forms; but there is an inte=
rval set apart for private=20

supplication, and the original congregations in the mosques availed themsel=
ves of this permission=20

more generally than is now the case, when the old fervour has become compar=
atively cool; and=20

Mohammad frequently enjoins private prayer at home, and specially praises h=
im who 'passeth his=20

night worshipping God.'  Almsgiving was originally compulsory, and the tax =
was collected by the=20

officers of the Khalif; but now the Muslim is merely expected to give volun=
tarily about a fortieth part=20

of his income in charity each year. The great fast of Ramadan is too well k=
nown to need more than=20

a passing mention here; but it is not so well known that Mohammad, ascetic =
as he was himself in=20

this as in many other matters, whilst he ordained the month of fasting for =
the chastening of his=20

able-bodied followers, was a determined enemy to useless mortification of t=
he flesh, and boldly=20

affirmed that God took no pleasure in a man's wantonly injuring himself; an=

shook him off.=E2=80=9D  Then he told Rusty of his adventures.  =E2=80=9CYo=

Blackbird said when he had finished. =E2=80=9CYou saved Young Black Buck=E2=

help you in return.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CProbably you can, Rusty. Who knows? =
I=E2=80=99m terribly mixed up in these strange=20

woods. I hardly know which way to go to find home. Perhaps you can direct m=
e.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, I can do=20

that easily.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThanks! That=E2=80=99s one good turn you ca=
n do me. Now for another. Is there any river or=20

stream near here that I can reach? If so I can go to it before Puma comes, =
and then wade down it=20

to throw him off my scent.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy, yes, there=E2=80=99s a s=
hallow brook only a mile from here. I can take=20

 brook?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGo down it a couple of miles until it=20

_
And the same wise leniency was shown by the Arab prophet in respect of pray=
er,--which may be=20

curtailed or omitted in certain cases,--and with regard to the pilgrimage, =
which no one was to=20

perform to his hurt. This same pilgrimage is often urged as a sign of Moham=
mad's tendency to=20

superstition and even idolatry. It is asked how the destroyer of idols coul=
d have reconciled his=20

conscience to the circuits of the Kaabeh and the veneration of the black st=
one  =E2=80=9CBut it=E2=80=99s a dreadful=20

night outside. Hear it rain.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, but it would be more d=
readful to stay here until Great Horn and=20

Puma appeared. Puma would kill me, and Great Horn would pounce upon you.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, of course,=20

we must go=E2=80=94right away, rain or no rain.=E2=80=9D  Bumper, who had b=
een listening to the conversation,=20

hopped to the entrance, and then came back. =E2=80=9CIf I=E2=80=99m any jud=
ge,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think you=E2=80=99ll have=20

such a wet trip. That shower was the last. The=20


_
kisses. The rites of the pilgrimage cannot certainly be defended against th=
e charge of superstition;=20

but it is easy to see why Mohammad enjoined them. They were hallowed to him=
 by the memories=20

of his ancestors, who had been the guardians of the sacred temple, and by t=
he traditional=20

reverence of all his people; and besides this tie of association, which in =
itself was enough to make=20

it impossible for him to do away with the rites, Mohammad perceived that th=
e worship in the=20

Kaabeh would prove of real value to his religion. He swept away the more ar=
e breaking away, and=20

the moon will soon be out.=E2=80=9D  White Tail was instantly on his feet, =
and beat Rusty to the front where=20

the two of them gazed up at the rain clouds now growing thin and ragged in =
places. They saw a=20

star twinkle in the east, and then another and another. The storm was, inde=
ed, over, and the night=20

trip through the woods would not be so disagreeable.  =E2=80=9CI must be of=

said. =E2=80=9CPuma may be back any minute.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou can=E2=
