was to the effect that she should be doing some unstated but specific thing=
....  In fact, that Tick-

of varying, but=20

 a long drive, even of=20

and grew increasingly absorbed in her studies, she almost forgot the matter=
 again.  Today,=20

perhaps because she was disturbed about Tick-Tock's behavior, the customary=
 response was=20

extraordinarily prompt. The warm glow of sunlight shining through her close=

Telzey. Telzey got the impression that TT was inviting her to go through th=
e door, and, for some=20

reason, the thought frightened her.  Again, there was an immediate reaction=
. The scene with Tick-
