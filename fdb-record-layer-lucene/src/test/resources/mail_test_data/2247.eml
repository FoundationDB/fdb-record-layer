in some way or other. My deficiency is proved to me by the fact that when I meet one of you who 

are famous for wisdom, and to whose wisdom all the Hellenes are witnesses, I am found out to 

know nothing. For speaking generally, I hardly ever have the same opinion about anything which 

you have, and what proof of ignorance can be greater than to differ from wise men? But I have 

one singular good quality, which is my salvation; I am not ashamed to learn, and I ask and 

enquire, and am very grateful to those who answer me, and never fail to give them my _New York 

Sun_, as his editor-in-charge.  The purpose was to bring the women of the country into a clearer 

understanding of their government and a closer relation with it.  This work had been so successful 

as to necessitate a force of four offices and twenty stenographers.  Bok now placed this 

Washington office on a war-basis, bringing it into close relation with every department of the 

government that would be connected with the war activities.  By this means, he had an editor and 

an organized force on the spot, devoting full time to the preparation of 


_
thanks; and when I learn a thing I never deny my teacher, or pretend that the lesson is a discovery 

of my own; but I praise his wisdom, and proclaim what I have learned from him. And now I cannot 

agree in what you are saying, but I strongly disagree. Well, I know that this is my own fault, and is 

a defect in my character, but I will not pretend to be more than I am; and my opinion, Hippias, is 

the very contrary of what you are saying. For I maintain that those who hurt or injure mankind, and 

speak falsely and deceive, and err voluntarily, are better far than those who do wrong involuntarily. 

Sometimes, however, I am of the opposite opinion; for I am all abroad in my ideas about this 

matter, a condition obviously occasioned by ignorance. And just now I happen to be in a crisis of 

my disorder at which those who err voluntarily appear to me better than those who err 

involuntarily. My present state of mind is due to our previous argument, which inclines me to 

believe that in general those who do wrong involuntarily are worse than those who do wrong 

voluntarily, and therefore I hope that you will be good to me, and not refuse to heal me; for you will 

do me a much greater benefit if you cure my soul of ignorance, than you would if you were to cure 

my body of disease. I must, however, tell you beforehand, that if you make a long oration to me 

you will not cure me, for I shall not be able to follow you; but if you will answer me, as you did just 

now, you will do me a great deal of good, and I do not think that you will be any the worse yourself. 

And I have some claim upon you also, O son of Apemantus, for you incited me to converse with 

Hippias; and now, if Hippias will not answer me, you must entreat him on my behalf.  EUDICUS: 

But I do not think, Socrates, that Hippias will require any entreaty of mine; for he has already said 

that he will refuse to answer no man.--Did you not say so, Hippias?  HIPPIAS: Yes, I did; but then, 

Eudicus, Socrates is always troublesome in an argument, and appears to be dishonest. (Compare 

Gorgias; Republic.)  SOCRATES: Excellent Hippias, I do not do so intentionally (if I did, it would 

show me to be a wise man and a master of wiles, as you would argue), but unintentionally, and 

therefore you must pardon me; for, as you say, he who is unintentionally dishonest should be 

pardoned.  EUDICUS: Yes, Hippias, do as he says; and for our sake, and also that you may not 

belie your profession, answer whatever Socrates asks you.  HIPPIAS: I will answer, as you 

request me; and do you ask whatever you like.  SOCRATES: I am very desirous, Hippias, of 

examining this question, as to which are the better--those who err voluntarily or involuntarily? And 

if you will answer me, I think that I can put you in the way of approaching the subject: You would 

admit, would you not, that there are good runners?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: And there are 

bad runners?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: And he who runs well is a good runner, and he who 

runs ill is a bad runner?  HIPPIAS: Very true.  SOCRATES: And he who runs slowly runs ill, and 

he who runs quickly runs well?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: Then in a race, and in running, 

swiftness is a good, and slowness is an evil quality?  HIPPIAS: To be sure.  SOCRATES: Which of 

the two then is a better runner? He who runs slowly voluntarily, or he who runs slowly 

involuntarily?  HIPPIAS: He who runs slowly voluntarily.  SOCRATES: And is not running a 

species of doing?  HIPPIAS: Certainly.  SOCRATES: And if a species of doing, a species of 

action?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: Then he who runs badly does a bad and dishonourable 

action in a race?  HIPPIAS: Yes; a bad action, certainly.  SOCRATES: And he who runs slowly 

runs badly?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: Then the good runner does this bad and disgraceful 

action voluntarily, and the bad involuntarily?  HIPPIAS: That is to be inferred.  SOCRATES: Then 

he who involuntarily does evil actions, is worse in a race than he who does them voluntarily? 



HIPPIAS: Yes, in a race.  SOCRATES: Well, but at a wrestling match--which is the better wrestler, 

he who falls voluntarily or involuntarily?  HIPPIAS: He who falls voluntarily, doubtless. 

SOCRATES: And is it worse or more dishonourable at a wrestling match, to fall, or to throw 

another?  HIPPIAS: To fall.  SOCRATES: Then, at a wrestling match, he who voluntarily does 

base and dishonourable actions is a better wrestler than he who does them involuntarily? 

HIPPIAS: That appears to be the truth.  SOCRATES: And what would you say of any other bodily 

exercise--is not he who is better made able to do both that which is strong and that which is weak-

-that which is fair and that which is department chiefs to secure the newest developments.  Bok 

learned that the country's first act would be to recruit for the navy, so as to get this branch of the 

service into a state of preparedness.  He therefore secured Franklin D. Roosevelt, assistant 

secretary of the navy, to write an article explaining to mothers why they should let their boys 

volunteer for the Navy and what it would mean to them.  He made arrangements at the American 

Red Cross Headquarters for an official department to begin at once in the magazine, telling 

women the first steps that would be taken by the Red Cross and how they could help.  He secured 

former President William Howard Taft, as chairman of the Central Committee of the Red Cross, for 

the editor of this department.  He cabled to Viscount Northcliffe and Ian Hay for articles showing 

what the English women had done at the outbreak of the war, the mistakes they had made, what 

errors the American women should avoid, the right lines along which English women had worked 

and how their American sisters could adapt these methods to trans-atlantic conditions.  And so it 

happened that when the first war issue of _The Journal_ appeared on April 20th, only three weeks 

after the President's declaration, it was the only monthly that recognized the existence of war, and 

its pages had already begun to indicate practical lines along which women could help.  The editor 

had been told that the question of food would come to be of paramount importance; he knew that 

Herbert Hoover had been asked to return to America as soon as he could close his work abroad, 

and he cabled over to his English representative to arrange that the proposed Food Administrator 

should know, at first hand, of the magazine and its possibilities for the furtherance of the proposed 

Food Administration work.  The Food Administration was no sooner organized than Bok made 

arrangements for an authoritative department to be conducted in his magazine, reflecting the 

plans and desires of the Food Administration, and Herbert Hoover's first public declaration to the 

women of America as food administrator was published in _The Ladies' Home Journal_.  Bok now 

placed all the resources of his four-color press-work at Mr. Hoover's disposal; and the Food 

Administration's domestic experts, in conjunction with the full culinary staff of the magazine, 

prepared the new war dishes and presented them appetizingly in full colors under the personal 

endorsement of Mr. Hoover and the Food Administration.  From six to sixteen articles per month 

were now coming from Mr. Hoover's department alone.  Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo 

interpreted the first Liberty Loan "drive" to the women; the President of the United States, in a 

special message to women, wrote in behalf of the subsequent Loan; Bernard Baruch, as chairman 

of the War Industries Board, made clear the need for war-time thrift; the recalled ambassador to 

Germany, James W. Gerard, told of the ingenious plans resorted to by German women which 

American women could profitably copy; and Elizabeth, Queen of the Belgians, explained the plight 

of the babies and children of Belgium, and made a plea to the women of the magazine to help.  So 

straight to the point did the Queen write, and so well did she present her case that within six 



months there had been sent to her, through _The Ladies' Home Journal_, two hundred and forty-

eight thousand cans of condensed milk, seventy-two thousand cans of pork and beans, five 

thousand cans of infants' prepared food, eighty thousand cans of beef soup, and nearly four 

thousand bushels of wheat, purchased with the money donated by the magazine readers. 

Considering the difficulties to be surmounted, due to the advance preparation of material, and 

considering that, at the best, most of its advance information, even by the highest authorities, 

could only be in the nature of surmise, the comprehensive manner in which _The Ladies' Home 

Journal_ covered every activity of women during the Great War, will always remain one of the 

magazine's most note-worthy achievements. This can be said without reserve here, since the 

credit is due to no single person; it was the combined, careful work of its entire staff, weighing 

every step before it was taken, looking as clearly into the future as circumstances made possible, 

and always seeking the most authoritative sources of information.  It was in the summer of 1918 

that Edward Bok received from the British Government, through its department of public 

information, of which Lord Beaverbrook was the minister, an invitation to join a party of thirteen 

American editors to visit Great Britain and France.  The British Government, not 


_
he does bad actions with the body, he who is better made does them voluntarily, and he who is 

worse made does them involuntarily.  HIPPIAS: Yes, that appears to be true about strength. 

SOCRATES: And what do you say about grace, Hippias? Is not he who is better made able to 

assume evil and disgraceful figures and postures voluntarily, as he who is worse made assumes 

them involuntarily?  HIPPIAS: True.  parties of American publicists should see, personally, what 

Great Britain had done, and was doing in the war; and it had decided to ask a few individuals to 

pay personal visits to its munition factories, its great aerodromes, its Great Fleet, which then lay in 

the Firth of Forth, and to the battle-fields.  It was understood that no specific obligation rested upon 

any member of the party to write of what he saw: 


_
bodily frame, and involuntary from the defect of the bodily frame?  HIPPIAS: True.  SOCRATES: 

And what would you say of an unmusical voice; would you prefer the voice which is voluntarily or 

involuntarily out of tune?  HIPPIAS: That which is voluntarily out of tune.  SOCRATES: The 

involuntary is the worse of the two?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: And would you choose to 

possess goods or evils?  HIPPIAS: Goods.  SOCRATES: And would you rather have feet which 

are voluntarily or involuntarily lame?  HIPPIAS: Feet which are voluntarily lame.  SOCRATES: But 

is not lameness a defect or deformity?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: And is not blinking a defect in 

the eyes?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: And would you rather always have eyes with which you 

might voluntarily blink and not see, or with which you might involuntarily blink?  HIPPIAS: I would 

rather have eyes which voluntarily blink.  SOCRATES: Then in your own case you deem that 

which voluntarily acts ill, better than that which involuntarily acts ill?  HIPPIAS: Yes, certainly, in 

cases such as you mention.  SOCRATES: And does not the same hold of ears, nostrils, mouth, he 

was asked simply to observe and then, with discretion, use his observations for his own guidance 

and information in future writing. In fact, each member was explicitly told that much of what he 

would see could not be revealed either personally or in print.  The party embarked in August amid 

all the attendant secrecy of war conditions.  The steamer was known only by a number, although 

later it turned out to be the White Star liner, _Adriatic_.  Preceded by a powerful United States 

cruiser, flanked by destroyers, guided overhead by observation balloons, the _Adriatic_ was found 

to be the first ship in a convoy of sixteen other ships with thirty thousand United States troops on 

board.  It was a veritable Armada that steamed out of lower New York harbor on that early August 

morning, headed straight into the rising sun.  But it was a voyage of unpleasant war reminders, 

with life-savers carried every moment of the day, with every light out at night, with every window 

and door as if hermetically sealed so that the stuffy cabins deprived of sleep those accustomed to 

fresh air, with over sixty army men and 


_
all the senses--those which involuntarily act ill are not to be desired, as being defective; and those 

which voluntarily act ill are to be desired as being good?  HIPPIAS: I agree.  SOCRATES: And 

what would you say of instruments;--which are the better sort of instruments to have to do with?--

those with which a man acts ill voluntarily or involuntarily? For example, had a man better have a 

rudder with which he will steer ill, lessons as to behavior in life-boats; and with a fleet of eighteen 

British destroyers meeting the convoy upon its approach to the Irish Coast after a thirteen days' 

voyage of constant anxiety.  No one could say he travelled across the Atlantic Ocean in war days 

for pleasure, and no one did.  Once ashore, the party began a series of inspections of munition 

plants, ship-yards, aeroplane factories and of meetings with the different
