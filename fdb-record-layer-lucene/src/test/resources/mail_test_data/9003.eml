abundance, all harmony, peace and perfection. Therefore the God Spirit with=
in me is the same. I=20

am sick in body; not in mind, not in Spirit.  Inasmuch as I cannot conceive=
 of God being sick=20

neither can I conceive of my Spirit being sick. My spirit is health, perfec=

may not be well, but since mind is all, since this material is subject to t=

subject to mind, I believe and affirm if you can not do this say frankly th=
