 I could about the merits=20

and varieties of water, its usefulness, and the ways in which it should be =

the next I shall write about the subject of dialling and the principles of =

INTRODUCTION   1. The ancestors of the Greeks have appointed such great hon=
ours for the=20

famous athletes who are victorious at the Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and =
Nemean games, that=20

they are not only greeted with applause as they stand with palm and crown a=
t the meeting itself,=20

but even on returning to their several states in the triumph of victory, th=
ey ride into their cities and=20

to their fathers' houses in four-horse chariots, and enjoy fixed revenues f=
or life at the public=20

expense. When I think of this, I am amazed that the same honours and even g=
reater are not=20

bestowed upon those authors whose boundless services are performed for all =
time and for all=20

nations. This would have been a practice all the more worth establishing, b=
ecause in the case of=20

athletes it is merely their own bodily frame that is strengthened by their =
training, whereas in the=20

case of authors it is the mind, and not only their own but also man's in ge=
neral, by the doctrines=20

laid down in their books for the acquiring of knowledge and the sharpening =
of the intellect.  2.=20

What does it signify to mankind that Milo of Croton and other victors of hi=
s class were invincible?=20

Nothing, save that in their lifetime they were famous among their countryme=
n. But the doctrines of=20

Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato, and Aristotle, and the daily life of other l=
earned men, spent in=20

constant industry, yield fresh and rich fruit, not only to their own countr=
ymen, but also to all=20

nations. And they who from their tender years are filled with the plenteous=
 learning which this fruit=20

affords, attain to the highest capacity of knowledge, and can introduce int=
o their states civilized=20

ways, impartial justice, and laws, things without which no state can be sou=
nd.  3. Since, therefore,=20

these great benefits to individuals and to communities are due to the wisdo=
m of authors, I think=20

that not only should palms and crowns be bestowed upon them, but that they =
should even be=20

granted triumphs, and judged worthy of being consecrated in the dwellings o=
f the gods.  Of their=20

many discoveries which have been useful for the development of human life, =
I will cite a few=20

examples. On reviewing these, people will admit that honours ought of neces=
sity to be bestowed=20

upon them.  4. First of all, among the many very useful theorems of Plato, =
I will cite one as=20

demonstrated by him. Suppose there is a place or a field in the form of a s=
quare and we are=20

required to double it. This has to be effected by means of lines correctly =
drawn, for it will take a=20

kind of calculation not to be made by means of mere multiplication. The fol=
lowing is the=20

demonstration. A square place ten feet long and ten feet wide gives an area=
 of one hundred feet.=20

Now if it is required to double the square, and to make one of two hundred =
feet, we must ask how=20

long will be the side Tatyana Ivanovna passionately, like a gipsy, but this=
 love took in him a=20

gloomy form, as though it cost him suffering. He was never affectionate to =
his wife in our=20

presence, but simply rolled his eyes angrily at her and twisted his mouth. =
 When he came in from=20

the fields he would noisily and angrily put down his gun, would come out to=
 us on the steps, and sit=20

down beside his wife. After resting a little, he would ask his wife a few q=
uestions about household=20

matters, and then sink into silence.  "Let us sing," I would suggest.  My t=
utor would tune his guitar,=20

and in a deep deacon's bass strike up "In the midst of the valley." We woul=
d begin singing. My=20



tutor took the bass, Fyodor sang in a hardly audible tenor, while I sang so=
prano in unison with=20

Tatyana Ivanovna.  When the whole sky was covered with stars and the frogs =
had left off croaking,=20

they would bring in our supper from the kitchen. We went into the lodge and=
 sat down to the meal.=20

My tutor and the gipsy ate greedily, with such a sound that it was hard to =
tell whether it was the=20

bones crunching or their jaws, and Tatyana Ivanovna and I scarcely succeede=
d in getting our=20

share. After supper the lodge was plunged in deep sleep.  One evening, it w=
as at the end of May,=20

we were sitting on the steps, waiting for supper. A shadow suddenly fell ac=
ross us, and Gundasov=20

stood before us as though he had sprung out of the earth. He looked at us f=
or a long time, then=20

clasped his hands and laughed gaily.  "An idyll!" he said. "They sing and d=
ream in the moonlight!=20

It's charming, upon my soul! May I sit down and dream with you?"  We looked=
 at one another and=20

said nothing. My uncle sat down on the bottom step, yawned, and looked at t=
he sky. A silence=20

followed. Pobyedimsky, who had for a long time been wanting to talk to some=
body fresh, was=20

delighted at the opportunity, and was the first to break the silence. He ha=
d only one subject for=20

intellectual conversation, the epizootic diseases. It sometimes happens tha=
t after one has been in=20

an immense crowd, only some one countenance of the thousands remains long i=
mprinted on the=20

memory; in the same way, of all that Pobyedimsky had heard, during his six =
months at the=20

veterinary institute, he remembered only one passage:  "The epizootics do i=
mmense damage to=20

the stock of the country. It is the duty of society to work hand in hand wi=
th the government in=20

waging war upon them."  Before saying this to Gundasov, my tutor cleared hi=
s throat three times,=20

and several times, in his excitement, wrapped himself up in his Inverness. =
On hearing about the=20

epizootics, my uncle looked intently at my tutor and made a sound between a=
 snort and a laugh.=20

"Upon my soul, that's charming!" he said, scrutinizing us as though we were=
 mannequins. "This is=20

actually life.... This is really what reality is bound to be. Why are you s=
ilent, Pelagea Ivanovna?" he=20

said, addressing Tatyana Ivanovna.  She coughed, overcome with confusion.  =
"Talk, my friends,=20

sing... play!... Don't lose time. You know, time, the rascal, runs away and=
 waits for no man! Upon=20

my soul, before you have time to look round, old age is upon you.... Then i=
t is too late to live!=20

That's how it is, Pelagea Ivanovna.... We mustn't sit still and be silent..=
.."  At that point supper was=20

brought out from the kitchen. Uncle went into the lodge with us, and to kee=
p us company ate five=20

curd fritters and the wing of a duck. He ate and=20


_
hundred feet corresponding to the doubling of the area. Nobody can find thi=
s by means of=20

arithmetic. For if we take fourteen, multiplication will give one hundred a=
nd ninety-six feet; if fifteen,=20

two hundred and twenty-five feet.  5. Therefore, since this is inexplicable=
 by arithmetic, let a=20

diagonal line be drawn from angle to angle of that square of ten feet in le=
ngth and width, dividing it=20

into two triangles of equal size, each fifty feet in area. Taking this diag=
onal line as the length,=20

describe another square. Thus we shall have in the larger square four trian=
gles of the same size=20

and the same number of feet as the two of fifty feet each which were formed=
 by the diagonal line in=20

the smaller square. In this way Plato demonstrated the doubling by means of=
 lines, as the figure=20

appended at the bottom of the page will show.  6. Then again, Pythagoras sh=
owed that a right=20

angle can be formed without the contrivances of the artisan. Thus, the resu=
lt which us all.=20

Whatever silly nonsense my precious tutor talked, and whatever Tatyana Ivan=
ovna did, he thought=20

charming and delightful. When after supper Tatyana Ivanovna sat quietly dow=
n and took up her=20

knitting, he kept his eyes fixed on her fingers and chatted away without ce=
asing.  "Make all the=20

haste you can to live, my friends..." he said. "God forbid you should sacri=
fice the present for the=20

future! There is youth, health, fire in the present; the future is smoke an=
d deception! As soon as=20

you are twenty begin to live."  Tatyana Ivanovna dropped a knitting-needle.=
 My uncle jumped up,=20

picked up the needle, and handed it to Tatyana Ivanovna with a bow, and for=
 the first time in my=20

life I learnt that there were people in the world more refined than Pobyedi=
msky.  "Yes..." my uncle=20

went on, "love, marry, do silly things. Foolishness is a great deal more li=
ving and healthy than our=20

straining and striving after rational life."  My uncle talked a great deal,=
 so much=20


_
squares, can be demonstrated to perfection from the reasoning and methods o=
f his teaching. If we=20

take three rules, one three feet, the second four feet, and the third five =
feet in length, and join=20

these rules together with their tips touching each other so as to make a tr=
iangular figure, they will=20

form a right angle. Now if a square be described on the length of each one =
of these rules, the=20

square on the side of three feet in length will have an area of nine feet; =
of four feet, sixteen; of five,=20

twenty-five.  7. Thus the area in number of feet made up of the two squares=
 on the sides three and=20

four feet in length is equalled by that of the one square described on the =
side of five. When=20

Pythagoras discovered this fact, he had no doubt that the Muses had guided =
him in the discovery,=20

and it is said that he very gratefully offered sacrifice to them.  This the=
orem affords a useful means=20

of measuring many things, and it is particularly serviceable listening to h=
im and dropping to sleep.=20

It distressed me that he did not once all the evening pay attention to me. =
He left the lodge at two=20

o'clock, when, overcome with drowsiness, I was sound asleep.  From that tim=
e forth my uncle took=20

to coming to the lodge every evening. He sang with us, had supper with us, =
and always stayed on=20

till two o'clock in the morning, chatting incessantly, always about the sam=
e subject. His evening=20

and night work was given up, and by the end of June, when the privy council=
lor had learned to eat=20

mother's turkey and _compote_, his work by day was abandoned too. My uncle =
tore himself away=20

from his table and plunged into "life." In the daytime he walked up and dow=
n the garden, he=20

whistled to the workmen and hindered them from working, making them tell hi=
m their various=20

histories. When his eye fell on Tatyana Ivanovna he ran up to her, and, if =
she were carrying=20

anything, offered his assistance, which embarrassed her=20
