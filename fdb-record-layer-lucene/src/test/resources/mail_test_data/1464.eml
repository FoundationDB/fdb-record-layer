philodendron monstera from the attack of righteous indignation that he was able to meet his father and the others with a fair degree of equanimity. In the back part of his mind, however, he held the fighting ultimatum in suspense. In the ago applied this title to him.  "With pleasure, Miss Woolridge.

The steamer you see sailing along the shore is an philodendron monstera from the attack of righteous indignation that he was able to meet his father and the others with a fair degree of equanimity. In the back part of his mind, however, he held the fighting ultimatum in suspense. In the ago applied this title to him.  "With pleasure, Miss Woolridge. It is the mirage, from the Latin _miror_, to wonder, which appears to be what you are doing just now. The steamer you see sailing along the shore is an _
to drop out of the ranks on the eve of a battle. You are not stopping to consider the construction 

which will be put upon any such hasty action on your part."  "I am not stopping to consider 

anything, Dick, save the fact that I was evidently expected to connive at a cynical and criminal 

disregard for the law of the land, the law which, as a member of the bar, I have sworn to uphold 

and defend. That is enough for me. I don't have to be knocked down and run over before I can 

realize that it's time to get out of the way."  "You say it's enough for you; it won't be enough for Mr. 

McVickar," Gantry interposed. "If you could afford to drop out--and I'm not admitting that you can--

he couldn't afford to let you." Then, with sudden gravity: "Hadn't you better let me hold up that 

telegram of yours for a few hours, Evan, until you've had time to cool down and think it over?" 

Blount sprang from his chair in a white heat.  "Do you mean to tell me that you are already holding 

it up?" he demanded.  "I took the liberty of holding it up--temporarily," confessed the traffic man 

coolly. "There is no harm done. Mr. McVickar is on his way West now, and he will be here in a day 

or two. Why not kill the message and have it out with him in person when he comes?"  Blount was 

not to be so easily appeased.  "I won't have my communications tampered with!" he exploded. "If 

you have given an order to have that telegram held out, you can give another to have it sent 

immediately!"  "All right," said Gantry; "just as you say." And he matter well enough to be 

interested in the dispute.  "The affirmative side of the question must prove its position," suggested 

the doctor.  "Which the affirmative will be very happy to do," replied the commander very 

cheerfully. "If the bottom of the canal were a dead level, paved like Broadway, and the depth of the 

canal were just twenty-six feet in every place, with a perpendicular wall on each side, your theory 

would be entirely correct, and the affirmative would have nothing more to say. But the bottom is 

not paved, and there are no walls at the sides to secure a uniform depth."  "Then the canal is not 

twenty-six feet deep, as the affirmative has laid down the law," added Uncle Moses.  "That looks 

like a lawyer's quibble," replied the captain with a hearty laugh. "You have opened the road for the 

retreat of the negative."  "The facts set forth by the speakers in our conference fail to be facts," 

persisted the legal gentleman.  "The fact was given as a general truth that the depth of the canal is 

twenty-six feet; but I think that no person as reasonable as Squire Scarburn of Von Blonk Park 

would insist that it should be absolutely of fully that depth in every part in order to comply with the 

general truth of the statement. The courts don't rule in that way. I read lately of a life insurance 

company which refused to pay a policy on the plea that the holder had been a drunkard; but the 

court ruled that the use of intoxicating liquors, or even an occasional over-indulgence, did not 

constitute a drunkard."

detain the enraged one who was turning his back and striding away. But after the self-discharged 

political manager was gone, the traffic man chuckled quietly and turned up a square of paper 

which had been lying on his desk during the short and belligerent interview.  "It's a nice lay-out," 

he mused, reading the type-written lines over again, "but the little lady was too fly for you this time, 

Evan, my boy. She was just prophetess enough to guess where and how you would go off the 

handle, clever enough to pass me the word to watch the wires after a certain train should get in 

from Ophir to-day. Great little woman, that. I believe she figures out more  "A wise ruling," added 

the squire.  "We call a person a good man; but even the affirmative does not insist that he shall be 

absolutely without sin, stain, or fault in order to entitle him to this designation."  "There would not 

be a single good man in that case," laughed the doctor. "We admit the general truth that the canal 

is twenty-six feet deep."  "The canal has been dug out of loose sand for the most part, and it would 

have been impossible to make it of uniform depth. Some of the largest steamers in the world pass 

through the canal on their way to India, China, and Australia. The Orient Line has the Ophir, a 

twin-screw ship, about five hundred

Honorable Senator's game, though this particularly fine move of sending Hathaway to touch a 

match to Evan's little powder-keg is one that I don't begin to understand." And he folded the 

telegram and carefully put it away in his pocket-book.  Evan Blount walked three squares beyond 

the Inter-Mountain Hotel before he had cooled down sufficiently to determine what to do next. As it 

chanced, the cooling-down process had led him to the door of the public garage patronized by his 

father. That thought of flying to Patricia for counsel and comfort was still with him, but it was over-

shadowed by a more militant desire to fight somebody; to go to his father and tell him how 

completely and successfully he had plotted with the vice-president to humiliate a son whose only 

offence was a decent regard for honor and uprightness.  Acting upon the impulse of the moment, 

he went in and asked if any of Senator Blount's cars were in the city. There was one--the big 

roadster; and Blount's decision was taken instantly. On that first day at Wartrace Hall his father 

had tried to give him one of the three motor-cars outright, and when he had refused to take it as a 

gift, a compromise had been made by which he was under promise to use any one of the 

machines he could get hold of when the need arose. Accordingly, a few minutes later he was 

behind the steering-wheel  "This big ditch across the isthmus has an average width of three 

hundred feet, or two hundred less than the length of the Ophir. She could not, therefore, get 

across the channel. There is a current in this water, and fierce winds sometimes blow across it, 

and both of these affect the inertia of the vessels. A comparatively small steamer like the 

Guardian-Mother can be twisted about by these causes, and her bow or her stern may catch on 

the sloping sides."  "You have made out your case, Captain Ringgold; and the moral is that 

general truths are not invariably true," said Uncle Moses good-naturedly.  "I only hope we shall not 

get aground," added Mrs. Belgrave.  "We are fairly started now, and we have Lake Menzaleh on 

one side, and a low sandy plain, once covered with water, on the other," continued the 

commander. "It is difficult to believe that the swamp and lagoon on the starboard were once 

covered with fertile fields, watered by two of the branches of the Nile, where wheat was raised in 

abundance, from which Rome and other countries were supplied with food."  "What vast flocks of 

birds!" exclaimed Mrs. Woolridge.  "Those are flamingoes, just rising from their resting-place," 

added the captain. "They were white just now as we looked at them; notice the color of the inside 

of their wings, which are of a rose-tinted pink."  "But what became

way through the traffic-burdened city streets and pointing straight for the country road leading 

north to the sage-brush hills.  Now, among its many attractions, motoring numbers--from the 

driver's point of view--this: that it effectually sweeps the brain of all other cares and distractions, 

sundry and several, since one may not drive a high-powered car at speed and successfully think 

of anything but the driving. Blount reached the entrance to the cottonwood-shaded avenue at 

Wartrace Blossom, after they had observed the wild birds for a time.  "The sea broke in and 

covered the rich lands with sand and salt; and there are towns buried there now."  "Goodness, 

gracious!" almost screamed Mrs. Blossom. "There's another steamer sailing on the land!"  "It 

appears to be so, but is not so," replied the commander.  "It is really so," added Mrs. Woolridge; 

and all the party gazed with interest at the phenomenon.  "Only apparently so," the captain 

insisted.  "Please to explain
