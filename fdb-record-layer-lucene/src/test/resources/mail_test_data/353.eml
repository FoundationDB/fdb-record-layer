one day that he let go a torrent of words that are unworthy to appear in pr=
int. He then broke down=20

and cried like a slave who was being lashed by his cruel master. He called =
Mary's mother and=20

father, Phyliss and Sandy, "I ain't got no more to do with you, you are fre=
e," he said, "if you want to=20

stay with me you may and I'll give you one-third of what you raise." They d=
ecided to stay. When=20

the crop was harvested the master did not do as he had promised. He gave th=
em nothing. Mary=20

slipped away, mounted the old mule sure-footed, and wily foe. The habit of =
carrying a heavy load=20

of palisades on the march would be a part of the same necessity.  Even from=
 the purely military=20

point of view, then, the She-wolf and the Twins seem to us not appropriate =
emblems of Roman=20

greatness. A better frontispiece for historians of Rome, if we mistake not,=
 would be some symbol=20

of the patroness of the lowlands and their protectress against the wild tri=
bes of the highlands.=20

There should also be something to symbolize the protectress of Italy agains=

gave her a letter to=20

give to Mr. Jamison. In it he reminded him that if he didn't give Mary's fa=
mily what he had=20

promised he would be put in jail. Without hesitation the old master complie=
d with these pungent=20

orders.  After this incident Mary and her family left the good old boss to =
seek a new abode in other=20

parts. This was the first time that the master had in any way displayed any=
 kind of unfairness=20

toward them, perhaps it was the reaction to having to liberate them.   MARR=
IAGE.  There was no=20

marriage during slavery according to civil or religious custom among the sl=
aves. If a slave saw a=20

woman whom he desired he told his master. If the woman in question belonged=
 on another=20

plantation, the master would consult her master: "one of my boys wants to m=
arry one of your gals,"=20

he would say. As a rule it was agreeable that they should live together as =
man and wife. This was=20

encouraged for it increased the slave population by new borns, hence, being=
 an asset to the=20

masters. The two slaves thus joined were allowed to see one another at inte=
rvals upon special=20

permission from the master. He must have a pass to leave the plantation. An=
y slave caught=20

without one while off the plantation was subject to be caught by the "pader=
ollers" (a low class of=20

white who roved the country to molest a slave at the least opportunity. Som=
e of them were hired=20

by the masters to guard against slaves running away or to apprehend them in=
 the event that they=20

did) who would beat them unmercifully, and send them back to the plantation=
 from whence they=20

came.  As a result of this form of matrimony at emancipation there were no =
slaves lawfully=20

married. Orders were given that if they preferred to live together as man a=
nd wife they must marry=20

according to law. They were given nine months to decide this question, afte=
r which if they=20

continued to live together they were arrested for adultery. A Mr. Fryer, Ju=
stice of the Peace at=20

Gainesville, was assigned to deal with the situation around the plantation =
where Mary and her=20

family lived. A big supper was given, it was early, about twenty-five slave=
 couples attended. There=20

was gaiety and laughter. A barrel of lemonade was served. A big time was ha=
d by all, then those=20

couples who desired to remain together were joined in wedlock according to =
civil custom. The=20

party broke up in the early hours of the morning.  Mary Biddie, cognizant o=
f the progress that=20

science and invention has made in the intervening years from Emancipation a=
nd the present time,=20

could not help but remark of the vast improvement of the lighting system of=
 today and that of=20

slavery. There were no lamps or kerosene. The first thread that shearer spu=
n was for a wick to be=20

used in a candle, the only means of light. Beef tallow was used to make the=
 candle; this was=20

placed in a candle mould while hot. The wick was then placed in the center =
of the tallow as it rest=20

in the mould; this was allowed to cool. When this chemical process occured =
there was a regular=20

sized candle to be used for lighting.  Mary now past the century mark, her =
lean bronze body=20

resting in a rocker, her head wrapped in a white 'kerchief, and puffing slo=
wly on her clay pipe,=20

Rome, though defeated at Allia, succeeded ultimately in arresting and hurli=
ng back, to the general=20

benefit of Italian civilization which, we may be sure, felt very grateful t=
o her for that service, and=20

remembered it when her existence was threatened by Hannibal, with Gauls in =
his army. Capua,=20

though not so well situated for the leadership of Italy, might have played =
the part of Rome; but the=20

plain which she commanded, though very rich, was too small, and too closely=
 overhung by the=20

fatal hills of the Samnite, under whose dominion she fell. Rome had space t=
o organize a strong=20

lowland resistance to the marauding highland powers. It seems probable that=
 her hills were not=20

only the citadel but the general refuge of the lowlanders of those parts, w=
hen forced to fly before=20



the onslaught of the highlanders, who were impelled by successive wars of m=
igration to the plains.=20

The Campagna affords no stronghold or rallying point but those hills, which=
 may have received a=20

population of fugitives like the islands of Venice. The city may have drawn=
 part of its population=20

and some of its political elements from this source. In this sense the stor=
y of the Asylum may=20

possibly represent a fact, though it has itself nothing to do with history.=
  Then, as to imperial=20

organization and government. Superiority in these would naturally flow from=
 superiority in=20

civilization, and in previous political training, the first of which Rome d=
erived from her comparative=20

wealth and from the mental characteristics of a city population; the second=
 she derived from the=20

long struggle through which the rights of the plebeians were equalized with=
 those of the patricians,=20

and which again must have had its ultimate origin in geographical circumsta=
nce bringing together=20

different elements of population. Cromwell was a politician and a religious=
 leader before he was a=20

soldier; Napoleon was a soldier before he was a politician: to this differe=
nce between the moulds=20

in which their characters were cast may be traced, in great measure, the di=
fference of their=20

conduct when in power, Cromwell devoting himself to political and ecclesias=
tical reform, while=20

Napoleon used his supremacy chiefly as the means of gratifying his lust for=
 war. There is=20

something analogous in the case of imperial nations. Had the Roman, when he=
 conquered the=20

world been like the Ottoman, like the Ottoman he would probably have remain=
ed. His thirst for=20

blood slaked, he would simply have proceeded to gratify his other animal lu=
sts; he would have=20

destroyed or consumed everything, produced nothing, delivered over the worl=
d to a plundering=20

anarchy of rapacious satraps, and when his sensuality had overpowered his f=
erocity, he would=20

have fallen in his turn before some horde whose ferocity was fresh, and the=
 round of war and=20

havoc would have commenced again. The Roman destroyed and consumed a good d=
eal; but he=20

also produced not a little: he produced, among other things, first in Italy=
, then in the world at large,=20

the Peace of Rome indispensable to civilization, and destined to be the ger=
m and precursor of the=20

Peace of Humanity.  In two respects, however, the geographical circumstance=
s of Rome appear=20

specially to have prepared her for the exercise of universal empire.=20


_
don' mo' than any other president, why you know ever since freedom they bee=
n talkin' 'bout dis=20

pension, talkin' 'bout it tha's all, but you see Mr. Roosevelt he don' com'=
 an' gived it tu us. What? I'll=20

DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA, FOLKLORE Ex-Slaves the first place, her position was =
such as to=20

bring her into contact from the outset with a great variety of races. The c=
radle of her dominion was=20

a sort of ethnological microcosm. Latins, Etruscans, Greeks, Campanians, wi=
th all the mountain=20

races and the Gauls, make up a school of the most diversified experience, w=
hich could not fail to=20
