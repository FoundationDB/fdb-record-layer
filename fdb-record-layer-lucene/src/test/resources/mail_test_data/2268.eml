_
to hold my right hand into those flames until it hath burned to a cinder th=
an to forgo the hope of=20

that vengeance which has eaten into my soul. It would hurt much less."  He =
had spoken thus at=20

great length, but with extraordinary restraint. Never once did he raise his=
 voice or indulge in=20

gesture. He spoke in even, monotonous tones, like one who is reciting a les=
son; and he sat=20

straight in front of the fire, his elbow on his knee, his chin resting in h=
is hand and his eyes fixed=20

upon the flames.  Chauvelin had listened in perfect silence. The scorn, the=
 resentful anger, the ill-

concealed envy of the fallen man for the successful upstart had died out of=
 his glance. Martin-

Roget's story, the intensity of feeling betrayed in places, but that would =
have thrown the heavier=20

work of the bow-paddle on the invalid, who happened also to be the better s=
teersman of the two.=20

A large stone placed in the stern would have been a simple and effective re=
medy, but, as we have=20

seen, no large stone was procurable just then.  "It didn't much matter in t=
he clumsy wooden things=20

at Red River," said Archie, "but this egg-shell of Okematan's is very diffe=
rent.  Ho! there's one at=20

last," he continued with animation as they rounded a point of land, and ope=
ned up a small bay, on=20

the margin of which there were plenty of pebbles, and some large water-worn=
 stones.  One of=20

these having been placed in the stern of the canoe, and the balance thus re=
ctified, the voyage was=20


_
sympathy to vibrate in the other's atrophied heart. How well he understood =
that vibrant passion of=20

hate, that longing to exact an eye for an eye, an outrage for an outrage! W=
as not his own life given=20

over now to just such a longing?--a mad aching desire to  "Don't you think =
that breakfast on one of=20

these islets would be nice?" said Billie.  "Just the very thing that was in=
 my mind, Little Bill,"=20

answered his brother.  It was a curious peculiarity in this sturdy youth, t=
hat whatever his invalid=20

brother wished,=20
