THE DESERT   Going to the hotel, Blount shut himself into a telephone booth=
 and tried,=20

ineffectually, to get a long-distance connection with Wartrace Hall. When h=
e finally grew=20

exasperated at the central operator's oft-repeated "line's busy," he called=
 up Gantry to ask if the=20

traffic manager knew anything about the purposes and movements of his fathe=

know, but he knew something else--a thing which proved the leakiness of the=

department.  "Come down here and tell me what you mean by sending incendiar=
y telegrams to the=20

vice-president," he commanded, with jesting severity. And with a hard word =
for the department=20

which had gossiped, Blount went down to the  "Until you settle my account w=

the pirate, as self-possessed as though he had been the victor dealing with=
 the vanquished.=20

"Don't say anything more to me about your account!" added the commander, fi=
ercely for him.=20

"Your protest is of no consequence to me, and I shall put you ashore to-nig=

scowl on his face.=20

"The Fatime was old and worn out, or your tender could not have crushed in =
her side. Let me tell=20

you that my noble master, the Pacha, ordered a new steam-yacht of a thousan=

and if you treat me with this inhumanity, he will follow you all over the w=

revenge."  [Illustration: "KNOTT, TAKE THIS VILLAIN AWAY." Page 201.]  "Tha=

Gantry was busy with the stenographer, but the business was immediately pos=

clerk dismissed when Blount entered.  "'Tell it out among the heathen,'" th=

jocosely, when the door closed behind the shorthand man.  "There is nothing=
 to tell--more than=20

you seem to know already," snapped Blount morosely. "I have wired my resign=
ation, that's all."=20

"But why?" persisted Gantry.  "Because I'm not going to be an accessory, ei=
