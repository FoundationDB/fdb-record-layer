philodendron monstera nevertheless was at his best when his picture was dom=
inated by a single color, as in the wonderful _Fedora_ of 1882 or _La Trico=
teuse_. In the former the warmly tinted hair and deep yellow fan are the vi=

the white butterfly making an _ensemble_ like a golden wheatfield swept by =
pale lights. The piquant note of contrast is given by the blue it was stron=

reflects a yellow background and a vase of flowers. The colors are said to =
have faded and=20

changed, to the complete demoralization of the color-scheme, but it is stil=

charm, less reserved and dignified than Whistler's _Lange Leizen_ of 1864, =
but with passages of=20

subtle color and a just relation of values that personal views may triumph =
over sane and just ideas,=20

and that the vigorous reasoning of Mr. John Quincy Adams and his co-laborer=
s may be ineffectual,=20

how can it be considered strange and out of the way that Mexico, under such=
 a supposition,=20

should announce that she will regard the annexation of Texas as an act of d=
eclaration of=20

war?=E2=80=9D[102] Secretary of State Upshur approved the course of Thompso=

that have survived the encroachments of time.  From a very early period Ste=
vens adopted the=20

camel's-hair shawl with its multi-colored border as the model for his palet=
te and the chief=20

decoration of his picture. It is easier, says one of his French critics, to=
 enumerate the paintings in=20

which such a shawl does not appear than those in which it does. It slips fr=
om the shoulders of the=20

_Desesperee_ and forms a wonderful contrast to the smooth fair neck and arm=
 relieved against it;=20

it is the magnificent background of the voluminous gauzy robe in _Une Doulo=
ureuse Certitude_; it=20

falls over the chair in which the young mother sits nursing her baby in _To=
us les Bonheurs_; it=20

hangs in the corners of studios, it is gracefully worn by fashionable visit=
ors in fashionable drawing-

rooms; its foundation color is cream or red or a deep and tender yellow as =
soft as that of a tea-

rose; it determines the harmony of the colored silks and bric-a-brac which =
are in its vicinity, it rules=20

its surroundings with a truly oriental splendor, and it gives to the work i=
n which it plays so=20

prominent a part an individuality supplementary to the artist's own. It is =
as important as the rugs in=20

the pictures of Vermeer of Delft or Gerard Terborch.  [Illustration: L'ATEL=
IER  _From a painting by=20

Alfred Stevens_]  The silks and muslins of gowns and scarves are also impor=
tant accessories in=20

these pictures which have a modernity not unlike that of the pictures of Ve=
lasquez, in which the=20

ugliness of contemporary fashions turns to beauty under the learned renderi=
ng of textures and=20

surfaces. Bibelots and furnishings, wall-hangings, pictures, rugs, polished=
 floors, glass and silver=20

and china and jewels are all likewise pressed into the service of an art th=
at used what lay nearest=20

to it, not for the purposes of realism but for the enchantment of the visio=
n. M. Lambotte has=20

pointed out that Stevens introduced mirrors, crystals and porcelains into h=
is canvasses with the=20

same intention as that of the landscape-painter who makes choice of a subje=
ct with a river, lake or=20

pond, knowing that clear reflections and smooth surface aid in giving the e=
ffect of distance and=20

intervening atmosphere. The same writer has told us that so far from reprod=
ucing the ordinary=20

costumes of his period Stevens took pains to seek exclusive and elegant exa=
mples, _chefs=20

d'oeuvres_ of the dressmaker's art, and that such were put at his service b=
y the great ladies of the=20

second empire. The beautiful muslin over-dress of the _Dame en Rose_ is per=
haps the one that=20

most taxed his flexible brush. It is language, he should demand either a wi=
thdrawal of the letter or=20

a suitable apology.  On November 3, 1843, Almonte, the Mexican minister at =
Washington, in=20

accordance with the instructions of his government, notified Upshur, in a c=
ommunication whose=20

terms were hardly less offensive than those used by Bocanegra to Thompson, =
that if =E2=80=9Cthe United=20

States should, in defiance of good faith and of the principles of justice w=
hich they have constantly=20

proclaimed, commit the unheard-of act of violence (_inaudito atentado_--the=
 expression [says the=20

official translator] is much stronger than the translation) of appropriatin=
g to themselves an integrant=20

part of the Mexican territory, the undersigned, in the name of his Nation, =
and now for them,=20

protests, in the most solemn manner, against such an aggression; and he mor=
eover declares, by=20

express order of his Government, that, on sanction being given by the Execu=
tive of the Union to=20

the incorporation of Texas into the United States, he will consider his mis=
sion ended, seeing that,=20

as the Secretary of State will have learned, the Mexican Government is reso=
lved to declare war so=20

soon as it receives information of such an act.=E2=80=9D On November 8th Up=
shur replied, in a restrained=20

and dignified way, repelling both the threats and insinuations of Almonte=
=E2=80=99s letter and intimating that=20

the policy of the United States would not be affected by them.[103] To this=
 Almonte rejoined, on=20

the 11th, suggesting that Upshur had been misled by an incorrect translatio=
n of the letter of=20



November 3d, and disclaiming any intention to impute to the authorities of =
the American Union=20

unworthy views or designs as to Texas. December 1, 1843, Upshur replied, de=
nying that he had=20

misunderstood Almonte, and declaring that the United States regarded Texas =
as an independent=20

nation and did not feel called on to consult any other nation in dealing wi=
th it.[104]  On the=20

accomplishment of annexation, the threat of Almonte was carried out. The jo=
int resolution making=20

the offer was approved March 1, 1845, and on March 6th he demanded his pass=
ports. March 28th=20

the United States minister in Mexico was officially notified that the diplo=
matic intercourse between=20

the two countries was at an end.[105] The expressions of the Mexican papers=
 indicated the most=20

intense popular excitement in that country, and those of the government tre=
ated the war as=20

already existing.[106] Two decrees were passed by the Mexican congress and =
approved by=20

President Herrera, one on June 4th and the other on June 7th, providing for=
 an increase of the=20

 its brilliant=20

polychromatic insets.  Unlike Whistler, Stevens never abandoned the rich an=

arrangements of his youth for an or executive, recommended to the congress =
a declaration of war=20

against the United States from the moment when the government should know t=
hat annexation=20

had been effected or Texas had been invaded.  There can be little question,=
 indeed, that=20

impatience on both sides had gone beyond the point of safety and was threat=

arms. No theory of a conspiracy is needed to explain the war with Mexico.=
