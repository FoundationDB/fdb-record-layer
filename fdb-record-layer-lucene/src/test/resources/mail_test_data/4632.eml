makes the gun go off, and kills the Nyemtzi.=E2=80=9D But no earthly happin=
ess is ever without alloy, and=20

Michael=E2=80=99s was not an exception. There was one hardship, in his own =
estimation very serious, to=20

which he had to submit. =E2=80=9CBarrinka,=E2=80=9D he asked, =E2=80=9Cwhy =
must our beards be cut off before we go to=20

fight the Nyemtzi?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt has been always done,=E2=80=9D sai=
d Ivan. =E2=80=9CIt is the custom. Besides, do you not=20

know it makes you a free man? The very hour your beard is cut, you cease to=
 be a serf; you have=20

no longer any lord on earth except the Czar.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI do not ca=
re to be a free man,=E2=80=9D grumbled Michael;=20

=E2=80=9Cand I do not see why I must part with my beard, which God gave me.=
 It is very hard.=E2=80=9D  Ivan=20

laughed. =E2=80=9CMy dear lad,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cyou have given yo=
ur hand for our lord the Czar; you are ready to=20

give your life for him; then why do you grudge him your beard?=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CDo you call it giving to _him_?=E2=80=9D=20

asked Michael. =E2=80=9CThat makes a difference certainly. Though I cannot =
see what the Czar wants with=20

my beard, still, if it be his Majesty=E2=80=99s pleasure, he shall have it.=
=E2=80=9D  Shortly afterwards he paid Ivan=20

another visit. Great was the transformation in his outer man. The cherished=
 beard was gone; he=20

wore, instead of his caftan, the green uniform of a gunner; and he was alre=
ady beginning to=20

acquire the indefinable but unmistakable air of the trained soldier. =E2=80=
=9COnly think, Barrinka,=E2=80=9D he began=20

eagerly;--=E2=80=9CI am afraid you will not believe me, but I am ready to s=
wear it is true upon the picture of=20

my saint. Besides, all the men in our corps heard it, and can tell you I sa=
y nothing but the fact, just=20

as it happened.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut you have not yet told me what the fa=
ct is. What has happened to you,=20

Michael?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe Czar has spoken to me,=E2=80=9D said Michae=
l with beaming eyes--=E2=80=9Cthe Czar, his very=20

self.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHow?--when?--what did he say?=E2=80=9D cried Ivan,=
 now thoroughly excited.  =E2=80=9CHe came to-day to=20

inspect our corps--=E2=80=98recruits for the artillery service,=E2=80=99 we=
 are called. You will not need to be told that=20

every man of us did his best, and that we made the air ring with our cheers=
 and =E2=80=98houras.=E2=80=99 When the=20

parade was over, I saw him speaking to our captain, who looked towards me, =
and then called me=20

forward. =E2=80=98Your Imperial Majesty,=E2=80=99 says he, =E2=80=98this is=
 the man.=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98Give me your hand, my brave lad,=E2=80=99=20

says the Czar, taking in his own this very hand of mine that you see now. =
=E2=80=98I know how you lost the=20

other, and I honour your courage and devotion. You have been tried and foun=
d faithful.=E2=80=99 I fell on=20

my knees and kissed the hand that held mine; which would be honour enough f=
or such as _you_,=20

Barrinka, not to speak of a poor mujik like me. Then he said to all of us, =
=E2=80=98You have done well, my=20

children;=E2=80=99 and we answered with a shout, =E2=80=98Father, we will d=
o better next time=E2=80=99[38] So he rode=20

away,--God bless him!--and the rest all crowded round me, embraced me, and =
wished me joy.=20

Now my one hand, which he has touched, is quite as good as two.=E2=80=9D  I=
van shared the joy of his=20

rather a devout and=20

apart absorbed in a book. The stirring romance of real life had of late dri=

came to the side of Tolstoi--a gay, good-natured youth, to whom he could sa=
y anything he=20

pleased. =E2=80=9CIs that a new book which you seem to like so much?=E2=80=
