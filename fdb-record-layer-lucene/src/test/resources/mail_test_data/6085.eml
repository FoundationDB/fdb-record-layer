 conditions.  The fabliaux, as we can study them, belong especially to the =

the victim of Renard's wiles. The prayers for the dead are recited, the bur=
ial is celebrated with due=20

honour, and Renard is summoned to justice; lie heaped upon lie will not sav=
e him; at last he=20

humbles himself with pious repentance, and promising to seek God's pardon o=
ver-sea, is=20

permitted in his pilgrim's habit to quit the court. It is this Judgment of =
Renard which formed the=20

basis of the _Reineke Fuchs_, known to us through the modernisation of Goet=
he.  From the date=20

of the Branch of the Judgment the Renard Romances declined. The Judgment wa=
s imitated by=20

inferior hands, and the beasts were more and more nearly transformed to men=
; the spirit of gaiety=20

was replaced by seriousness or gloom; Renard ceased to be a light-footed an=
d ingenious rogue;=20

he became a type of human fraud and cruelty; whatever in society was false =
and base and=20

merciless became a form of "renardie," and by "renardie" the whole world se=
emed to be ruled.=20

Such is the temper expressed in _Le Couronnement Renard_, written in Flande=

rior in execution to the=20

_Judgment_, it had remarkable success, to which the allegory, wearying to a=
 modern reader, no=20

doubt contributed at a time when allegory was a delight. The last of the Re=
nard romances,=20

_Renard le Contrefait_, was composed at Troyes before 1328, by an ecclesias=
tic who had=20

renounced his profession and turned to trade. In his leisure hours he spun,=
 in discipleship to Jean=20

de Meun, his interminable poem, which is less a romance than an encyclopaed=
ia of all the=20

knowledge and all the opinions of the author. This latest _Renard_ has a va=
lue akin to that of the=20

second part of _Le Roman de la Rose_; it is a presentation of the ideas and=
 manners of the time=20

by one who freely criticised and mocked the powers that be, both secular an=
d sacred, and who=20

was in sympathy with a certain movement or tendency towards social, politic=
al, and intellectual=20

reform.   III FABLIAUX  The name _fabliaux_ is applied to short versified t=
ales, comic in character,=20

and intended rather for recitation than for song. Out of a far larger numbe=
r about one hundred and=20

fifty have survived. The earliest--_Richeut_--is of the year 1159. From the=
 middle of the twelfth=20

century, together with the heroic or sentimental poetry of feudalism, we fi=
nd this bourgeois poetry=20

of realistic observation; and even in the _chansons de geste_, in occasiona=
l comic episodes,=20

something may be seen which is in close kinship with the fabliaux. Many bri=
ef humorous stories,=20

having much in common under their various disguises, exist as part of the t=
radition=20
