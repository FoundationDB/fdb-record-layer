philodendron monstera too, as nobody steals from him. In that way he is better off than the farmers who never help raccoons or bears, or badgers."  "How much corn can we have?" asked Bobby.  "We may bring away with us all we can carry, so I hope you are feeling strong, my boy," replied Father Bear.  At this Bobby philodendron monstera too, as nobody steals from him.

spider and the rat and the bird have done? Yes; and then I should no longer have need to be a 

giant, for I could tame him, even I myself in my proper form! It is a good thought. I may yet be the 

hero of Kisington. But I must be careful of the precious glass and not waste its powers. 'Thrice 

more may it be used,' so says the scroll. Once, then, for the Dragon, and two times more for 

accidents that may happen."  Without more ado Arthur made ready for his great adventure. For 

arms he took but two things--the magic glass in his wallet, and a butterfly-net over his shoulder. In 

truth, the little fellow looked more like a schoolboy bound for a holiday in the woods, than a hero in 

quest of honor.  Now, first, without saying aught of his intent to any in Kisington, he journeyed to 

the Capital City, to gain the King's permission for the trial.  With the handle of his butterfly-net he 

thumped upon the door of the King's palace and said: "Open! I wish to speak with the King!"  The 

warders looked at him and laughed; he was such a strange little figure. "What do you want of the 

King?" they asked.  "Tell him that I helped me around the house."  [Illustration: "BOBBY, BOBBY, 

GET UP AT ONCE"]  At this Bobby Bear jumped right up, for he had been looking forward to the 

trip to the place where the corn grew. Besides he always liked to go walking with his father 

because he loved him so much.  It was a beautiful morning and Bobby soon forgot how tired he 

was when he saw the fine breakfast his mother set before him. But when, breakfast over, he saw 

the pile of dishes and knew he had to wash all those before he could go on his trip, he could not 

help crying. Bobby Bear didn't like washing dishes.  The tears would come somehow and there 

was a big lump in his throat which seemed to be there all the time although he swallowed it over 

and over again.  "Now, my boy," cried his father, "how much longer are you going to be? I have 

almost finished my pipe. Just as soon as I am through smoking I am going to start."  Bravely 

forcing back his tears, Bobby Bear hurried with the drying of the dishes which by this time were all 

washed.  A few minutes later, he cried joyfully: "All through! Now we're ready to go," and he began 

to jump up

Dragon of Hushby."  "Ho, ho!" roared the warders. But they went and told the King what Arthur 

said. "He is mad, Your Majesty," they added. "He is a little fellow, armed with a butterfly-net. Ho, 

ho!"  The King laughed, too. But he was curious to see this champion. So he had Arthur admitted. 

With his net over his shoulder, Arthur marched into the long hall, between the rows of tittering 

courtiers, and knelt before the King. "So you intend to slay the Dragon of Hushby?" said the King. 

"It needs a giant for that deed. What will you do, forsooth, you little fellow, with your butterfly-net?" 

"Your Majesty," said Arthur, "do you not remember how David was a little fellow, when with a 

stone he slew the giant Goliath? Well, I am another little fellow; but I have a stone in my pocket 

with which I mean to tame a foe more terrible than David's was. And as for this net--wait, and you 

shall see!"  "Very well," said the King, laughing, "I will wait and see. But what reward shall you 

"Wait, my boy, till I fill my pipe, for we have a long way to go." Father Bear took the little tobacco 

bag from his trouser pocket, filled his pipe, pushed the tobacco down with his thumb and, striking a 

match, was soon puffing away contentedly.  Bobby, meanwhile, was so glad to be going for a walk 

with his father, that he was skipping merrily about, just like a little dog.  "You seem glad this 

morning," said Father Bear. Then, with a glance at Mother Bear, who was standing by smiling he 

added: "Perhaps it is because you're all through with your house work, eh?"  At this, Bobby Bear 

grew red in the face, for after all just washing dishes wasn't much help to his mother with the 

housework.  He asked timidly, "Mother, perhaps before I go, I should help you some more."  At 

this, both Father Bear and Mother Bear smiled. "Oh no, my boy," said his mother kindly. "You 

have helped me quite a lot as it is and I am very willing to have my little Bobby Bear run off now 

and enjoy

"Your Majesty," said Arthur politely, "may I ask to see your daughter? I have heard that the 

Dragon-Slayer may hope to win her hand."  At these words of Arthur's the King burst into a roar of 

laughter, and clapped his knee, as though it were a mighty joke. And all the courtiers held their 

sides and shook with mirth. But Arthur was angry, for he did not see     THEY VISIT THE 

FARMER'S CORNFIELD   "Where are you going to get the corn?" asked Bobby Bear, as he 

trotted along beside his father that bright, sunny morning.  "Why," Father Bear replied, "we have 

been invited by Farmer Jenkins to go and take as much as we like."  "He must be a kind man," 

answered Bobby.  "He is. Not all farmers are as kind as he. Yet it is
