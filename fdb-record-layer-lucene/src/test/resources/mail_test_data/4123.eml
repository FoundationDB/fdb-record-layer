kes but small part in this form of death, the general agreement of opinion =

s of death from asphyxia.  Among the symptoms often present in drowning per=
sons, _
besides such books as the _Finer Forces of Nature_, etc., the _Zohar_, _Sep=
her Jetzirah_, _The=20

Book of Enoch_, Franck's _Kabalah_, and many Hermetic treatises. These are =
scarce in=20

European languages, but works in Latin by the mediaeval Philosophers, gener=
ally known as=20

Alchemists and Rosicrucians, are plentiful. But even the perusal of these m=
ay prove dangerous for=20

the unguided student. If approached without the right key to them, and if t=
he student is unfit, owing=20

to mental incapacity, for Magic, and is thus unable to discern the Right fr=
om the Left Path, let him=20

take our advice and leave this study alone; he will only bring on himself a=
nd on his family=20

unexpected woes and sorrows, never suspecting whence they come, nor what ar=
e the powers=20

awakened by his mind being bent on them. Works for advanced students are ma=
ny, but these can=20

be placed at the disposal of only sworn or "pledged" chelas (disciples), th=
ose who have=20

pronounced the ever-binding oath, and who are, therefore, helped and protec=
ted. For all other=20

purposes, well-intentioned as such works may be, they can only mislead the =
unwary and guide=20

him imperceptibly to Black Magic or Sorcery--if to nothing worse.  The myst=
ic characters,=20

alphabets and numerals found in the divisions and sub-divisions of the _Gre=
at Kabalah_, are,=20

perhaps, the most dangerous portions in it, and especially the numerals. We=
 say dangerous,=20

because they are the most prompt to produce effects and results, and this w=
ith or without the=20

experimenter's will, even without his knowledge. Some students are apt to d=
oubt this statement,=20

simply because after manipulating these numerals they have failed to notice=
 any dire physical=20

manifestation or result. Such results would be found the least dangerous: i=
t is the moral causes=20

produced and the various events developed and brought to an unforeseen cris=
is, that would testify=20

to the truth of what is now stated had the lay students only the power of d=
iscernment.  The point of=20

departure of that special branch of the Occult teaching known as the "Scien=
ce of=20

Correspondences," numerical or literal or alphabetical, has for its epigrap=
h with the Jewish and=20

Christian Kabalists, the two mis- interpreted verses which say that God    =
   ordered all things in=20

number, measure and weight;(117)   and:       He created her in the Holy Gh=
ost, and saw her, and=20

numbered her,     and measured her.(118)   But the Eastern Occultists have =
another epigraph:=20

"_Absolute Unity, x_, within number and plurality." Both the Western and th=
e Eastern students of=20

the Hidden Wisdom hold to this axiomatic truth. Only the latter are perhaps=
 more sincere in their=20

confessions. Instead of putting a mask on their Science, they show her face=
 openly, even if they=20

do veil carefully her heart and soul before the inappreciative public and t=
he profane, who are ever=20

ready to abuse the most sacred truths for their own selfish ends. But Unity=
 is the real basis of the=20

Occult Sciences--physical and metaphysical. This is shown even by Eliphas L=
evi, the learned=20

Western Kabalist, inclined as he is to be rather jesuitical. He says:      =
 Absolute Unity is the=20

supreme and final reason of things.     Therefore, that reason can be neith=
er one person, nor three=20

persons; it is Reason, and pre-eminently Reason (_raison par     excellence=
_).(119)  them is of=20

any other nature than the medium in which the animal is destined to live. C=
onsequently the name=20

asphyxia is applied generically to all accidental conditions in which life =
is threatened by any=20

intervention whatever of the respiration. (See MECHANICAL SUFFOCATION, Vol.=
 I., p. 705 _et=20

seq._, and ASPHYXIATING GASES, Vol. IV.)  Submersion in any liquid medium c=
auses asphyxia.=20

This condition may be caused on being surrounded by a medium devoid of oxyg=
en and improper=20

to support sufficient h=C3=A6matosis, as hydrogen, nitrogen, and the protox=
ide of nitrogen, gases not=20

toxic properly speaking, but considered irrespirable. Diminished respiratio=
n from deficiency of=20



oxygen is the true cause of asphyxia. No animal can maintain the respirator=
y process in an=20

atmosphere devoid of oxygen or in one that does not contain at least ten pe=
r cent of this gas, and=20

such quadrupeds as whales, hippopotami, and seals or the pygopodous birds w=
ould drown in the=20

same manner as a dog if kept submerged long enough. The suppression of the =
gaseous=20

exchange by submersion is also fatal to such aquatic insects as hydrophiles=
, dytiscid=C3=A6, and the=20

like, which drown in the same manner as the hymenoptera, coleoptera, dipter=
a, or other terrestrial=20

insects. Ants drown in less than a minute when the body is wet, and the dis=
appearance of=20

apparent vitality is accompanied by convulsive movements indicating functio=
nal trouble of the=20

nervous apparatus. Sir John Lubbock found that after eight hours of immersi=
on they could be=20

restored to life, and several ants after two days and five days were restor=
ed to momentary life with=20

feeble motions, followed by death in two hours. Even a terrestrial plant wh=
en submerged drowns=20

like a terrestrial animal, the mechanism of asphyxia by submersion being th=
e same in plants and=20

aerian animals, and due to closure of the principal way of gaseous exchange=
.  Notwithstanding the=20

interruption of the gaseous exchange necessary to support life, there is lo=
ng persistence of vitality=20

after submersion of some creatures in which an intra-molecular respiration =
or gaseous dialysis=20

with aerated water takes place, as in ants who have not been wetted before =
submersion.  The=20

resistance of new-born animals to this mode of asphyxiation is especially n=
oted in the greater time=20

required to drown a pup than an adult dog. One minute and a half usually su=
ffices to drown a dog,=20

while a new-born pup often requires as much as fifty minutes. This great di=
fference is owing to the=20

less active change of tissue and the smaller consumption of oxygen in the y=
oung animal. The=20

more active the vital combustion and the greater the demand upon the genera=
l store of oxygen in=20

the blood, the quicker the young animal perishes when the respiration is ob=
structed.  It is observed=20

in a general way that all kinds of death caused by the privation of respira=
ble air have between=20

themselves the greatest resemblance. Whatever be the obstacle that intercep=
ts the connection of=20

the lungs with the atmosphere, the apparent differences are only secondary =
and the essential=20

symptoms are identical, because all act in suppressing the functions of the=
 blood and h=C3=A6matosis.=20

In fact, the phenomena of asphyxia are constant and related to disturbances=
 in the respiration,=20

innervation, and circulation, which vary according as the=20


_
The meaning of this Unity in Plurality in "God" or Nature, can be solved on=
ly by the means of=20

transcendental methods, by numerals, as by the correspondences between soul=
 and the Soul.=20

Names, in the _Kabalah_ as in the _Bible_, such as Jehovah, Adam Kadmon, Ev=
e, Cain, Abel,=20

Enoch, are all of them more intimately connected, by geometrical and astron=
omical relations, with=20

Physiology (or Phallicism) than with Theology or Religion. Little as people=
 are as yet prepared to=20

admit it, this will be shown to be a fact. If all those names are symbols f=
or things hidden, as well as=20

for those manifested, in the _Bible_ as in the _Vedas_, their respective my=
steries differ greatly.=20

Plato's motto "God geometrises" was accepted by both Aryans and Jews; but w=
hile the former=20

applied their Science of Correspondences to veil the most spiritual and sub=
lime truths of Nature,=20

the latter used their acumen to conceal only one--to them the most divine--=
of the mysteries of=20

Evolution, namely, that of birth and generation, and then they deified the =
organs of the latter.=20

Apart from this, every cosmogony, from the earliest to the latest, is based=
 upon, interlinked with,=20

and most closely related to, numerals and geometric figures. Questioned by =
an Initiate, these=20

figures and numbers will yield numerical values based on the integral value=
s of the Circle--"the=20

secret habitat of the ever-invisible Deity" as the Alchemists surrounding m=
edium, according as=20

asphyxia is immediate or slow. The fatal result of asphyxia is owing to the=
 introductory arrest of the=20

pulmonary circulation, the capillaries of the lungs being incapable of conv=
eying venous blood. The=20

stagnation of the blood in the lungs is followed by paresis of the respirat=
ory centre and stoppage of=20

the heart.   STAGES AND SYMPTOMS OF DEATH BY DROWNING.  The authorities are=
 that an=20

individual who dies asphyxiated by submersion passes through three stages. =
At first he=20

experiences a violent shock, followed by an inspiration of surprise, which =
results from the contact=20

of water with the lungs causing a reflex cough. Then for some seconds there=
 is a voluntary=20

suspension of respiration, giving rise to other forcible involuntary expira=
tions. In this dyspn=C5=93ic=20

second period the face and brain become congested, owing to slowing of the =
encephalic=20

circulation. Loss of consciousness soon follows, when the drowning person e=
nters the third stage,=20

which is that of asphyxia. In this period the individual gasps deeply, the =
pupils are dilated, the=20

sphincters paralyzed, and the limbs are agitated by clonic convulsions. Thi=
s is followed by=20

complete insensibility and speedy death.  When a fatal termination in drown=
ing results from that=20

form of neuro-paralysis known as _syncope_, in which death begins at the he=
art, we infer from=20

experiments that the sudden loss of consciousness=20


_
such mysteries, whether anthropographical, anthropological, cosmic, or psyc=
hical. "In reuniting=20

Ideas to Numbers, we can operate upon Ideas in the same way as upon Numbers=
, and arrive at=20

the Mathematics of Truth," writes an Occultist, who shows his great wisdom =
in desiring to remain=20

unknown.       Any Kabalist well acquainted with the Pythagorean system of =
    numerals and=20

geometry can demonstrate that the metaphysical views     of Plato were base=
d upon the strictest=20

mathematical principles.     "True mathematics," says the _Magicon_, "is so=
mething with which=20

all higher sciences are connected; common mathematics is but a     deceitfu=
l phantasmagoria,=20

whose much praised infallibility only     arises from this--that materials,=
 conditions and references=20

are     made to foundation." ...      The cosmological theory of numerals w=
hich Pythagoras learned=20

in     India, and from the Egyptian from the violent impressions that the s=
ensitive nerves convey to=20

the bulb. Such a result is more likely to occur in persons with weak heart =
and languid circulation,=20

who are more susceptible to fright and shock or to the sudden collapse from=
 intense cold. It is also=20

shown that stammerers, who have a defective innervation of the phrenic and =
of the=20

pneumogastric, succumb more rapidly than others.  The importance of syncope=
 as a cause of=20

death in drowning is much restricted when we consider the fact that the cir=
culation is the last of the=20

functions extinguished in an animal that for purposes of experiment has bee=
n subjected to=20

submersion. This has been shown in a sensuous way by experiment, aided by t=
he resources of=20

the graphic method, which registers the respiratory modifications as shown =
by the pneumograph=20

and also the condition of the femoral artery in connection with a kymograph=
ion. The heart=20
