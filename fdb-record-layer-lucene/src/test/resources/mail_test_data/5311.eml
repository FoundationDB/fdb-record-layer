The history of the education of the ante-bellum Negroes, therefore, falls into two periods. The first 

extends from the time of the introduction of slavery to the climax of the insurrectionary movement 

about 1835, when the majority of the people in this country answered in the affirmative the 

question whether or not it was prudent to educate their slaves. Then followed the second period,
