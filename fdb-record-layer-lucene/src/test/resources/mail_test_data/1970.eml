Enemy snipers give us a great deal of trouble. It is very difficult to loca=
te them. One of our men=20

tried out an original scheme. He put an empty biscuit tin on the parapet. I=
mmediately the sniper=20

put a bullet through it. Now thought the Genius, "If I look through the two=
 holes it will give me my=20

direction,"--so getting up on the firestep he looked through, only to roll =
over with the top of his=20

head smashed off by a bullet. The sniper was shooting his initials on the t=
in.                    -------------

------------------------  We are all used to dead bodies or pieces of men, =
so much so that we are not=20

troubled by the sight of them. There was a right hand sticking out of the t=
rench in the position of a=20

man trying to shake hands with you, and as the men filed out they would oft=
en grip it and say, "So=20

long, old top, we'll be back again soon." One man had the misfortune to be =
buried in such a way=20

that the bald part of the head showed. It had been there a long time and wa=
s sun-dried. Tommy=20

used him to strike his matches on. A corpse in a trench is quite a feature,=
 and is looked for when=20

the men come back again to the same trench.  We live mostly on bully beef a=
nd hard tack. The=20

first is corned beef and the second is a kind of dog biscuit. We always won=
dered why they were so=20

particular about a man's teeth in the army. Now I know. It's on account of =
these biscuits. The chief=20

ingredient is, I think, cement, and they taste that way too. To break them =
it is necessary to use the=20

handle of your entrenching tool or a stone. We have fried, baked, mashed, b=
oiled, toasted,=20

roasted, poached, hashed, devilled them alone and together with bully beef,=
 and we have still to=20

find a way of making them into interesting food.  However, the Boche likes =
our beef. He prefers the=20

brand canned in Chicago to his own, and will almost sit up and beg if we th=
row some over to him.=20

The method is as follows: Throw one over ... sounds of shuffling and gettin=
g out of the way are=20

heard in the enemy trench. Fritz thinks it's going to go off. Pause, and th=
row another. Fritz not so=20

suspicious this time. Keep on throwing until happy voices from enemy trench=
es shout, "More! Give=20

us more!" Then lob over as many hand grenades as you can pile into that par=
t of the trench and=20

tell them to share those too.  It takes some time to distinguish whether sh=
ells are arrivals or=20

departures, but after a while you get into the way of telling their directi=
on and size by sound.=20

Roads are constantly shelled, searching for troops or supply columns. I was=
 coming home to-day,=20

up a road which ran approximately at right angles to main fire trenches. At=
 one place the road was=20

exposed for a matter of thirty or forty feet, and again farther up it was n=
ecessary to go over the=20

brow of a small hill. This was about three hundred yards farther on and was=
 exposed to the=20

enemy's view. Thinking they wouldn't bother about a single rider on a motor=
 cycle, I went up past=20

the first exposed position. My carburetor was giving me some trouble and I =
thought I would see if=20

any rain had got into it, so I turned off the road down a cross-road and di=
smounted when _crash_!=20

a shell landed right in the middle of the road as far up the exposed place =
as I was round the=20

corner. Then five more followed the first shell. Had I gone on I could not =
possibly have missed=20

collecting most of the fragments. The German gunners had spotted me in the =
first position and=20

decided that a lone man on a motor cycle must be either an officer or despa=
tch rider. So they tried=20

to get him. The shells were shrapnel and the time was calculated splendidly=
. They had taken into=20

consideration the speed of my motor cycle. Cross-roads are particularly att=
ended to, for there is a=20

double chance of hitting something, and in consequence it is always unhealt=
hy to linger on a=20

crossroad.                    -------------------------------------  Dugout=
s are often made very comfortable with=20

windows, tiled floors and furniture taken from neighboring shattered chatea=
ux. I have even seen=20

them with flowers growing in window-boxes over the entrance. They all have =
names. Some I saw=20



yesterday were called "Anti-Krupp Cottage," "Pleasant View," and "Little Gr=
ey Home in the West."=20

There was one very homey site, well equipped and fitted, which had been dub=
bed the "Nut,"--the=20

colonel lived there.  My old corps brought an aeroplane down with a machine=
 gun last night. They=20

were in a shell hole between the main and support trenches.  For the last f=
ew days I have been=20

"up" looking for gun positions.  The lice are getting to be a torment. You =
have no idea how bad=20

they are. Everybody up here is infested with them. I have tried smearing my=
self with kerosene, but=20

that does not seem to trouble them at all. Silk underwear is supposed to ke=
ep them down. I=20

suppose their feet slip on the shiny surface.  The food lately has taken on=
 a wonderful flavor and I=20

now know how dissolved German tastes. The cook, instead of sending back two=
 miles for water to=20

cook with, has been using water from the moat in which a Boche had been slo=
wly disintegrating.=20

To-day I was able to see what a German seventeen-inch shell could do;  680 =
feet. A stratum of=20

Kirwan's stell-stein. That is, an aggregate of fine-grained quartz and mica=
, without any felspar. The=20

quartz is mostly greenish, probably coloured by the next stratum.  670 feet=
. Beautiful green=20

soapstone. Very compact, but rather softer than that kind in common use for=
 inkstands.  666 feet.=20

A green, granular aggregate. It seems to be made up of fine fragments of qu=
artz, soapstone, and=20

mica, rarely a little felspar, slightly compacted together.  _Remark._ All =
the strata, from the inner=20

termination of the drift to this place, a distance of one hundred and thirt=
y-four feet, are nearly=20

vertical, or a very little inclined. Here they begin to approach a horizont=
al position.  The green=20

aggregate continues as far as the air-well, a distance of 66 feet, with som=
e trifling variations in the=20

size and proportions of the aggregated fragments.  500 feet. A granulated, =
schistose aggregate,=20

chiefly of quartz and mica. Though the constituents and the form of the roc=
k correspond very=20

nearly with mica slate, it cannot be considered as the primitive mica slate=
 rock. It is so slightly=20

compacted that it can scarcely be kept from falling to pieces. Its position=
 is nearly horizontal.  480=20

feet. A stratum of coal, half an inch thick. This stratum may be traced, at=
 different intervals, one=20

hundred and eighty feet along the drift towards its mouth. It lies between =
the strata of the last=20

described schistose aggregate.  400 feet. An aggregate appears, alternating=
 with the loose=20

schistose rock, which resembles the red sandstone, but is of a less firm te=
xture.  From this place=20

all the strata, east of the soapstone, occasionally appear, for the distanc=
e of about three hundred=20

feet. This is probably on account of their undulatory forms and horizontal =
position. Most of the way=20

we find the lower part of the walls to consist of a kind of semi-indurated =
puddingstone. Sometimes=20

a thin stratum of fine, loose sand occurs. At 300 feet the coal stratum dis=
appears, passing below=20

the bottom of the drift.  The last hundred feet is chiefly gravel, which is=
 now supported by timbers.=20

_Southampton, Aug. 26, 1818._     ART. VII. _On the Peat of Dutchess County=
--read before the=20

Lyceum of Natural History, in New-York, by the Rev._ F. C. SCHAEFFER, _of N=
ew-York, and by=20

him communicated to the Editor_.   In May, 1817, I brought specimens of mar=
l and _peat_ from=20

Dutchess county, which were taken from a fen or bog occupying an area of so=
me acres. These=20

fens occur frequently in the towns of Rhinebeck, Northeast, Clinton, &c. in=
 Dutchess county.=20

During a part of the year they are covered with water.  A pit was dug in th=
e bog from which I=20

procured the specimens. The order and depth of the well-defined strata whic=
h were exhibited by=20

this excavation, I noted in my memorandum book, from which I extract the fo=
llowing:  After clearing=20

away the fresh sod and recent vegetable mould, there appeared,    1. A stra=
tum or bed of _peat_=20

commonly called _turf_, varying in   depth from three to four feet.    2. A=
 stratum of peat and marl=20



commingled; depth two feet.    3. A stratum of pure marl, from two to three=
 feet. Below these=20

there was an appearance of sand and blue clay.  The first, or upper stratum=
, consists of _compact=20

peat_. This substance, when first taken up, is of a dark brown colour, soft=
, and rather viscid. Some=20

vegetable fibres and vacuous seeds are distributed throughout the mass. It =
may be moulded to=20

any convenient form. When perfectly dry, the texture of this variety, of wh=
ich there is a specimen=20

before you, acquires a high degree of solidity. Its fracture is earthy; the=
 colour is lighter.  I should=20

not have offered more on this subject than the labelled specimen, had I not=
 made a most=20

satisfactory experiment with this kind of fuel, which may be obtained in gr=
eat abundance in our=20

own State. It is easily kindled; burns with a bright flame; yields a bluish=
 smoke, and produces an=20

odour similar to that which attends the combustion of gramineous substances=
. But this is=20

momentary. When thoroughly kindled, it burns with less flame, yields a smal=
l proportion of blackish=20

smoke, and sulphurous acid gas is evolved, though I cannot discover any pyr=
ites. It burns for a=20

long time, and emits a great body of heat. It leaves a very small proportio=
n of light, grayish white=20

ashes; on which I have as yet made no experiments, having this day, for the=
 first time, paid=20

particular attention to this substance, attracted by the unusual hardness w=
hich it acquired since it=20

is in my possession: and not many hours have elapsed since I subjected it t=
o combustion. The=20

attempt succeeded so well, that I cannot refrain from expressing my opinion=
, that this variety of=20

peat will answer as an excellent substitute for the best Liverpool coal.   =
  ART. VIII. _Notices of=20

Geology in the West-Indies._   REMARKS.  In the former Number of this work,=
 a notice was=20

 emplacement in a=20

piece of ground which is decidedly unhealthy to visit during daylight. I ha=
ve been there in daylight,=20

but I had to creep out of it. On the map it is called a farm, but the highe=
