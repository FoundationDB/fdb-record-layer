had been started upon his Americanization career, and answered; "This is Am=

national passion for cleanliness, "if your window were clean."  "That's so,=
 too," mused the baker.=20

"Perhaps you'll clean it."  "I will," was the laconic reply.  And Edward Bo=
k, there and then, got his=20

first job.  He went in, found a step-ladder, and put so much Dutch energy i=

aker.  "Yes, I=20

want to play ball," replied the boy, but he was not reserving his Saturday =
afternoons for games,=20

although, boy-like, that might be his preference.  Edward now took on for e=
ach Saturday morning--

when, of course, there was no school--the delivery route of a weekly paper =
called the _South=20

Brooklyn Advocate_.  He had offered to deliver the entire neighborhood edit=
ion of the paper for=20

one dollar, thus increasing his earning capacity to two dollars and a half =
per week.  Transportation,=20

in those days in Brooklyn, was by horse-cars, and the car-line on Smith Str=
eet nearest Edward's=20

home ran to Coney Island. Just around the corner where Edward lived the car=
s stopped to water=20

the horses on their long haul.  The boy noticed that the men jumped from th=
e open cars in=20

summer, ran into the cigar-store before which the watering-trough was place=
d, and got a drink of=20

water from the ice-cooler placed near the door.  But that was not so easily=
 possible for the women=20

and the children, who were forced to take the long ride without a drink.  I=
t was this that he had in=20

pening, and Edward=20

decided to fill it.  He bought a shining new pail, screwed three hooks on t=

hung three clean shimmering glasses, and one Saturday afternoon when a car =
stopped the boy=20

leaped on, tactfully asked the conductor if he did not want a drink, and th=
