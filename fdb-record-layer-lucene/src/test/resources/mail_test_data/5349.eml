philodendron monstera half tears. "The Lord be praised!--though I never had any doubt of it," the proud old lady said.  "It has all come perfectly clear," said Millefleurs, pleased with his position as the centre of this eager group. "The right man, the person to whom it really happened, has come philodendron monstera half tears. "The Lord be praised!--though I never had any doubt of it," the proud old lady said.  "It has all come perfectly clear," said Millefleurs, pleased with his position as the centre of this eager group. "The right man, the person to whom it really happened, has come _
communities."  "And you're a good guesser," grunted Long Jerry. "Anyhow, unless I'm much 

mistook, you'll have means of knowin' afore long."  "Then," said Helen, to Ruth, "we must get the 

balsam to-day for our pillows. It won't snow yet awhile, will it, Jerry?"  "May not snow at all to-day," 

replied the guide. "This weather we've had for some days has been storm-breeding, and it's been 

long comin'. It won't be soon past, I reckon."  This course Nora, when she came to herself, 

explained that it was a sudden little spasm, a feeling of faintness,--something she was used to. 

She was quite well, she declared; and so it proved by the colour that came back to her face. "She 

has not been herself all the morning," said Miss Barbara; "she will be the better of young 

company--of somebody like herself."  After this the ladies tried to talk on indifferent subjects. There 

were inquiries

by the way the girls acted that there was "something in the wind."  The girls ignored Tom, Bob and 

Isadore as they chatted at the breakfast table, and at once they went about their own small affairs, 

leaving the boys by themselves.  Tom and his mates discussed some plan for a few minutes and 

then Tom sang out: "Who'll go sliding? There's a big bob-sled in the barn and we fixed it up 

yesterday morning. It will hold the whole crowd. How long will it take you girls to get ready?" 

Helen turned her back on him. Ruth looked described as being "better than we should have dared 

to hope," with as near an approach to the truth as possible; and then a scattered fire of remarks, 

now one, now another, coming to the front with sudden energy; while the others relapsed into the 

listening and strain of curiosity. Miss Barbara held her head high. It was she who was the most 

steady in the conversation. She would not suffer it to be seen that she had any tremor as to what 

was going on. But the girls were unequal to this fortitude. They fluctuated from red

Madge Steele exclaimed: "You can go sliding alone, little boy. We certainly sha'n't accompany 

you."  "Aw, speak for yourself, Miss," growled her brother. Then Bob turned deliberately to Helen 

and asked: "Will you go sliding, Helen?"  "No, sir!" snapped Helen.  "Aw, let 'em alone, Bob," said 

Isadore. "Who wants 'em, anyway?"  Jennie Stone would have replied, only Belle and Lluella 

shook her. It took two girls to shake Heavy satisfactorily. And the entire six ignored the three boys, 

who went off growling among themselves. They would stop in the middle of a sentence, their 

voices ending in a quaver, as if the wind had blown them out. Why should they be so moved? Miss 

Barbara noted it keenly, and felt with a thrill of pleasure that John was getting justice. Two of 

them!--the bonniest creatures in the county! How their rival claims were to be settled afterwards 

she did not inquire; but in the meantime, at the moment when he was under so dark a cloud, it 

warmed her heart to see him so much thought of: the Erskines always were so; they were a

"Just for a little old mess of candy," snorted Isadore, who was the last to leave the house.  "That's 

the way to treat them!" declared Madge, tossing her head, when the boys had gone.  "I don't 

know," said Ruth slowly. "We might be glad to have them help us get the pine-needles."  "I believe 

you are too soft-hearted, Ruth Fielding," declared Belle Tingley.  "It's because she likes Tom so 

well," said Lluella, slily.  "Well, Tom never did so mean a thing before yesterday," said Tom's 

sister, sharply.  "Boys are all alike when they get together," said Heavy. "It spoils 'em awfully to 

flock in crowds."  "What does it do to girls?" demanded last representative was worthy of his sires. 

Hours seemed to pass while the ladies thus held each other in a wonderful tension and restraint, 

waiting for the news: until a little commotion in the stair, a hurried step, brought them all to their 

feet with one impulse. It was little Millefleurs who rushed in with his hat pressed to his breast. 

"Forgive the intrusion," he cried, with pants of utterance; "I'm out of breath; I have run all the way. 

Erskine is coming after me with Lord Lindores." He shook hands with everybody vehemently in his 

satisfaction. "They let me in because I was the Duke's son, don't you know; it's convenient now 

and

"Gives them pluck," declared Madge Steele. "We've got to keep the boys down--that's the only 

way to manage them."  "My, my!" chuckled Jennie Stone, the stout girl. "Madge is going to be a 

regular suffragette; isn't she?"  "Well, I guess girls can flock by themselves and have just as good 

times without their brothers, as with them."  But Ruth and Helen looked more than doubtful at this 

point. They knew that Tom Cameron, at least, had been a loyal friend and mate on many a day of 

pleasure. They nobody presents me to Miss Erskine," he said, aggrieved. "Madam, I am 

Millefleurs. I was Erskine's fag at Eton. I have run miles for him to buy his buns and jam; but I was 

slimmer in those days."  Miss Barbara had sunk upon a chair. She said, with a panting of her 

ample bosom as if she had been running too, "You are too kind, my Lord Millefleurs. I told John 

Erskine to be here at half-past one to his luncheon. You will all wait and meet him. You will wait 

and meet him----" She repeated the
