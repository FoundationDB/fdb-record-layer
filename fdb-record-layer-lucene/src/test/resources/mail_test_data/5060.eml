was passing through the crisis, and stood by her until she breathed her las=

of the U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, p. 210.]   Earlier in the nineteenth centur=
y the philanthropists of=20

Pennsylvania had planned to establish for Negroes several higher institutio=
ns. Chief among these=20

was the Institute for Colored Youth. The founding of an institution of this=
 kind had been made=20

possible by Richard Humphreys, a Quaker, who, on his death in 1832, devised=
 to a Board of=20

Trustees the sum of $10,000 to be used for the education of the descendants=
 of the African=20

race.[1] As the instruction of Negroes was then unpopular, no steps were ta=
ken to carry out this=20

plan until 1839. The Quakers then appointed a Board and undertook to execut=
e this provision of=20

Humphreys's will. In conformity with the directions of the donor, the Board=
 of Trustees endeavored=20

to give the colored youth the opportunity to obtain a good education and ac=
quire useful knowledge=20

of trades and commercial occupations. Humphreys desired that "they might be=
 enabled to obtain a=20

comfortable livelihood by their own industry, and fulfill the duties of dom=
estic and social life with=20

reputation and fidelity as good citizens and pious men."[2] Accordingly the=
y purchased a tract of=20

land in Philadelphia County and taught a number of boys the principles of f=
arming, shoemaking,=20

and other useful occupations.  [Footnote 1: Wickersham, _History of Educati=
on in Pa._, p. 249.]=20

[Footnote 2: _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, p. 379.]   Ano=
ther stage in the=20

development of this institution was reached in 1842, the year of its incorp=
oration. It then received=20

several small contributions and the handsome sum of $18,000 from another Qu=
aker, Jonathan=20

Zane. As it seemed by 1846 that the attempt to combine the literary with th=
e industrial work had=20

not been successful, it was decided to dispose of the industrial equipment =
and devote the funds of=20

the institution to the maintenance of an evening school. An effort at the e=
stablishment of a day=20

school was made in 1850, but it was not effected before 1852. A building wa=
s then erected in=20

Lombard Street and the school known thereafter as the Institute for Colored=
 Youth was opened=20

with Charles L. Reason of New York in charge. Under him the institution was=
 at once a success in=20

preparing advanced pupils of both sexes for the higher vocations of teachin=
g and preaching. The=20

attendance soon necessitated increased accommodations for which Joseph Daws=
on and other=20

Quakers liberally provided in later years.[1]  [Footnote 1: _Special Report=
 of the United States=20

Com. of Ed._, 1871, p. 380.]  This favorable tendency in Pennsylvania led t=
o the establishment of=20

Avery College at Alleghany City. The necessary fund was bequeathed by Rev. =
Charles Avery, a=20

rich man of that section, who left an estate of about $300,000 to be applie=
d to the education and=20

Christianization of the African race.[1] Some of this fund was devoted to m=
issionary work in Africa,=20

large donations were made to colored institutions of learning, and another =
portion was=20

appropriated to the establishment of Avery College. This institution was in=
corporated in 1849.=20

Soon thereafter it advertised for students, expressing willingness to make =
every provision without=20

regard to religious proclivities. The school had a three-story brick buildi=
ng, up-to-date apparatus=20

for teaching various branches of natural science, a library of all kinds of=
 literature, and an=20

endowment of $25,000 to provide for its maintenance. Rev. Philotas Dean, th=
e only white teacher=20

connected with this institution, was its first principal. He served until 1=
856 when he was succeeded=20

by his assistant, M.H. Freeman, who in 1863 was succeeded by George B. Vash=
on. Miss Emma J.=20

Woodson was an assistant in the institution from 1856 to 1867. After the di=
n of the Civil War had=20

ceased the institution took on new life, electing a new corps of teachers, =
who placed the work on a=20



higher plane. Among these were Rev. H.H. Garnett, president, B.K. Sampson, =
Harriet C. Johnson,=20

and Clara G. Toop.[2]  [Footnote 1: _African Repository_, vol. xxxiv., p. 1=
56.]  [Footnote 2:=20

_Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, p. 381.]  It was due also t=
o the successful forces=20

at work in Pennsylvania that the Ashmun Institute, now Lincoln University, =
was established in that=20

State. The need of higher education having come to the attention of the Pre=
sbytery of New Castle,=20

that body decided to establish within its limits an institution for the "sc=
ientific, classical, and=20

theological education of the colored youth of the male sex." In 1853 the Sy=
nod approved the plans=20

of the founders and homesteads. He has deprived their lords of the dangerou=
s privilege of sending=20

them to Siberia without a trial; nor dare any one, however rich or great, u=
se his serfs with=20

harshness or cruelty. Amongst many stories of his interference on behalf of=
 the oppressed, I=20

remember one concerning a great lady, whose name I will not tell you, as sh=
e lives in this city.=20

From that love of money which the priests tell us is a root of all evil, sh=
e neglected her sick and=20

aged serfs, and allowed them to suffer from want. The Czar heard of it, and=
 he sent his own=20

physician to minister to these poor suffering peasants, whom no man cared f=
or. Dr. Wylie--so they=20

call him--a shrewd, clever Scotchman, took care to order his patients so ma=
ny expensive remedies=20

and comforts that the princess, by the time she had paid for wine and wheat=
en flour, and I know=20

not what besides, had also learned the useful lesson that nothing costs so =
dear in the long run as=20

a duty neglected. Nor has the Czar given the mujik that which costs him not=
hing. He refuses=20

absolutely to grant men as serfs to his courtiers; and thus he has dried up=
 the unfailing stream of=20

wealth wherewith all the Czars that went before him have enriched and rewar=
ded their servants=20

without impoverishing themselves. God give it back to him in the prayers of=
 the poor! Moreover, I=20

have heard that every year, out of his own treasure, he lays by one million=
 of roubles to aid in the=20

fulfilment of his beloved and cherished dream--to make the body of every mu=
jik on the soil of holy=20

Russia as free as his soul is already in the sight of God.=E2=80=9D  The ra=
pt, kindling expression of his face=20

as he spoke thus impressed the children deeply. He seemed to be gazing far =
away into some=20

=E2=80=9Cwhite starry distance=E2=80=9D where he could see the fruition of =
that glorious dream. But gradually the=20

light faded, and the shadow passed once more over the aged face.  =E2=80=9C=
Who shall see that day?=E2=80=9D he=20

murmured sadly. =E2=80=9CNot the old; their work is quickly over, while God=
=E2=80=99s work goes on but slowly. No,=20

not the old; they are content to lie down in hope, waiting for what God wil=
l let them see in the=20

resurrection morning. But the young.--He is young yet, this Czar God has gi=
ven us, whose youthful=20

dreams are not of pleasure, or conquest, or glory, but of loosing the heavy=
 burdens, letting the=20

oppressed go free, and breaking every yoke. Shall it be given to him to see=
 the desire of his heart?=20

It may be--before his hairs are white as mine. But it may not. I have heard=
 the priests say that,=20

after all, it was not Moses who led the children of Israel into the Promise=
d Land.=E2=80=9D  Ivan and Feodor=20

waited in respectful silence until his reverie was over. Then Ivan began to=
 question him upon a=20

subject about which he was interested, and indeed perplexed.  =E2=80=9CD=C3=
=A4dushka, why do you seem to=20

think the Czar ought not to have made this peace with Napoleon for which al=
l the bells in the city=20

have been ringing?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere be many reasons, boy--good reas=
ons and bad, noble reasons and=20

selfish. Of the selfish reasons I need not tell you. You are now surrounded=
 by merchants; you will=20

soon be surrounded by nobles. No doubt you will hear lamentations enough fr=
om both--for the=20

luxuries wherewith English commerce supplied the tables of the one, and the=
 gold with which it=20

filled the purses of the other. But what, perhaps, you will never hear, is =
the truth that lies buried=20



beneath that stream of idle talk. Have you ever, in Nicolofsky, listened on=
 winter nights to the low=20

howling of the wolves amidst the snow? There is a horrible story I remember=
 hearing in my=20

childhood about a woman--a mother--who was making a winter journey in her s=
ledge with her five=20

little ones. Perhaps you too know the tale? The famished pack with their de=
mon voices howled=20

around her sledge. To save all the rest, as she fondly dreamed, she sacrifi=
ced one child, her=20

youngest. Then a moment of respite, a verst or two gained upon the savage p=
ursuers--a wild,=20

fleeting gleam of hope. Then--_then_;--but I need not go on. She reached he=
r journey=E2=80=99s end alone,=20

to die the next day, accursed and broken-hearted.[12] Forget the story if y=
ou can, but remember=20

the awful lesson. The taste for blood grows with what it feeds on, and the =
doom of the coward only=20

comes the more quickly from his guilty efforts to avert it. The French are =
wolves, and Napoleon is=20

a demon. Already has he devoured the nations of Germany, and it has but whe=
tted his appetite for=20

fresh victims. He deceives the Czar--who is young, and likes to think other=
s as true and generous=20

as himself--with his offers of peace. But the peace he offers is only from =
the lip out; for he hates=20

us, and he will never cease to hate us. Why not? We stand upright, while th=
e other nations--all=20

except the English--bow down and=20


_
institution should be under the supervision and control of the Presbytery o=
r Synod within whose=20

bounds it might be located. A committee to solicit funds, find a site, and =
secure a charter for the=20

school was appointed. They selected for the location Hensonville, Chester C=
ounty,=20

Pennsylvania.[1] The legislature incorporated the institution in 1854 with =
John M. Dickey, Alfred=20

Hamilton, Robert P. DuBois, James Latta, John B. Spottswood, James Crowell,=
 Samuel J. Dickey,=20

Alfred Hamilton, John M. Kelton, and William Wilson as trustees. Sufficient=
 buildings and=20

equipment having been provided by 1856, the doors of this institution were =
opened to young=20

colored men seeking preparation for work in this country and Liberia.[2]  [=
Footnote 1: Baird, _A=20

Collection_, etc., p. 819.]  [Footnote 2: _Special Report of the United Sta=
tes Com. of Ed._, 1871,=20

p. 382.]  An equally successful plan of workers in the West resulted in the=
 founding of the first=20

higher institution to be controlled by Negroes. Having for some years belie=
ved that the colored=20

people needed a college for the preparation of teachers and preachers, the =
Cincinnati Conference=20

of the Methodist Episcopal Church in session in 1855 appointed Rev. John F.=
 Wright as general=20

agent to execute this design. Addressing themselves immediately to this tas=
k Rev. Mr. Wright and=20

his associates solicited from philanthropic persons by 1856 the amount of $=
13,000. The agents=20

then made the purchase they are all infidels, those Frenchmen. They believe=
 neither in God, nor=20

saint, nor devil. Therefore I think that if we had put our trust in God, an=
d gone to war with them=20

again, he would have protected holy Russia, the land of his people and of h=
is orthodox Church.=E2=80=9D=20

Old Petrovitch, in speaking thus, expressed the thoughts and feelings of th=
e mass of his=20

countrymen. They were ignorant and superstitious, but they were devout. The=
y believed in =E2=80=9Cthe=20

God of Russia,=E2=80=9D and in the Czar as the first of his servants. A tim=
e was drawing near when this=20

belief of theirs should be tried in the furnace heated seven times. The tri=
al proved beyond a doubt=20

that metal was there, genuine and enduring; but how much was the pure gold =
of faith, and how=20

much the iron of a fierce fanaticism? There is one test potent to divide be=
tween the gold and the=20

iron. The fanatic may endure like a martyr and fight like a hero; but when =
the battle is past, and the=20

victory won, he will trample on the fallen like a tyrant;--for his God is t=
he God of vengeance. But=20

while the man of faith can suffer and fight, and that with a heroism as und=
aunted, he can also=20

pardon;--for his God is the God of mercy, and He whose =E2=80=9Cright hand =
