Sanchoniathon the Phoenician--the oldest of Historians--say that these Myst=
eries originated in the=20

night of time, thousands of years probably before the historical living."  =
Athos was for a few=20

moments thoughtful.  "Good! D'Artagnan is for Mazarin," he said to himself.=
  From that moment he=20

grew very guarded.  On his side D'Artagnan became more cautious also.  "You=

e Mysteries of Byblus and=20

Tyre, in the     sacred operations of the Syrians, and in the Mysteries of =
the     Phoenicians.(522)=20

As was said in _Isis Unveiled_:       When men like Pythagoras, Plato and I=
amblichus, renowned=20

for their     severe morality, took part in the Mysteries and spoke of them=
 with     veneration, it ill=20

behoves our modern critics to judge them [and     their Initiates] upon the=
ir merely external aspect.=20

Yet this is what has been done until now, especially by the Christian Fathe=
rs. Clement=20

Alexandrinus stigmatises the Mysteries as "indecent and diabolical" though =
his words, showing=20

that the Eleusinian Mysteries were identical with, and even, as he would al=

those of the Jews, are quoted elsewhere in this work. The Mysteries were co=

is man, we always want something more than we already have."  "What does Po=

"To be a baron."  "Ah, true! I forgot," said Athos, laughing.  "'Tis true!"=
 thought the Gascon, "where=20

has he heard it? Does he correspond with Aramis? Ah! if I knew that he did =
I should know all."=20

The conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Raoul.  "Is our little =
neighbor worse?" asked=20

D'Artagnan, seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth.  "Ah, sir!"=
 replied Raoul, "her fall is=20

a very serious one, and without any ostensible injury, the physician fears =
she will be lame for life."=20

"This is terrible," said Athos.  "And what makes me all the more wretched, =
sir, is, that I was the=20

cause of this misfortune."  "How so?" asked Athos.  "It was to run to meet =

 ought to be perfectly=20

satisfactory, at any rate for every unprejudiced mind.  He says:--        "=
There's only one remedy,=20

dear Raoul--that is, to marry her as a compensation." remarked D'Artagnan. =
 "Ah, sir!" answered=20

Raoul, "you joke about a real misfortune; that is cruel, indeed."  The good=
