finding it impossible to earn an honest livelihood in this country, he fled=
 from it, with the aid of=20

money supplied him by his sister and brother-in-law (for by this time Clara=
 had become the wife of=20

a good-natured, easy-going fellow, who held an appointment in her Majesty's=
 Customs); and I lost=20

sight of him amid a crowd of steerage passengers on board an emigrant ship =
bound for Australia,=20

where I hope he is now living as a creditable member of society.     THE WO=

Of all scoundrels in society, there are none so bad as great quantities of =
stone are  [Illustration:=20

MAKING MATS FOR LEVEE FRONTS.]  dumped, and various similar means are used =
to=20

encourage the scour in the shallower parts of the river, and also to preven=
t the undermining of the=20

natural or artificial banks.  =E2=80=9COn a convex shore, where the water i=
s shoal, the levee has been=20

carried along the river edge as near as possible, as there is no danger, un=
der such conditions, of a=20

caving bank. Where the bank is liable to give way, the levees are placed fu=
rther back, and where a=20

break in the levee itself has occurred from the caving of the bank, loops a=

broken parts. It must be=20

dishonest lawyers--unless it be unprincipled doctors. And I think that the =
palm of villany, if there be=20

such a thing, might be claimed by a few of the latter class in any competit=
ion with the former.=20

There is no limit to the mischief, and no fathoming the depths of crime whi=
ch a surgeon may=20

commit. Few men, perhaps, have also such ample opportunities for eluding de=
tection. It is fair to=20

say that I believe the crime along the river are about forty feet high abov=
e low water, and as the=20

river rises five to seven feet over these banks, the levees are constructed=
 of sufficient height to=20

restrain the waters within their proper limits. The material is found on th=
e spot, either clay or sand,=20

as the case may be. A so-called =E2=80=9Cmuck=E2=80=9D ditch a few feet wid=

_
dishonesty, or malfeasance, is rare among that most honourable profession o=
f medicine and=20

surgery; but the exceptions, although few, are terrible.  "Doctor, you have=
 been very good to me,"=20

said an old woman, "and I have done wrong to you, and hope you will forgive=
 me, and be kind to=20

me; for I am a poor lone old woman, with no friend in the world but you, do=
ctor."  The doctor=20

smiled blandly at the compliment here paid him.  This old woman was a paupe=
r patient. The doctor=20

attended her by order of the relieving-officer of the ---- Union; the local=
ity of which, it is enough for=20

the reader to know, was on the south side of the metropolis.  The doctor ha=
d been many years a=20

parish surgeon; and at trees. By this method some adhesion to the ground is=
 gained, and the=20

artificial construction is not easily swept away. The earth is taken from t=
he front of the levee line as=20

near the water as the circumstances will permit. Standard levees have a =E2=

top, of eight feet, except in the case of a very low levee, when the =E2=80=
=9Ccrown=E2=80=9D is not less than its=20

izontal. Present levees=20
