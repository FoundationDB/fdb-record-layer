his peril, was thus borne to safety across the roaring torrent of the chasm=
. But the summer visitor=20

must not expect to find the Lyd a roaring torrent.  There are some fine tor=
s near Lydford, though=20

not the highest of the moorland. Brent Tor is singularly picturesque, and i=
s a notable landmark by=20

reason of the Early England church on its summit. The hill was fortified in=
 early times, traces of=20

stone and earthwork remaining; and there is a legend, as so often with high=
-standing churches,=20

that the devil resented the church being built on what he considered his sp=
ecial domain, but was=20

discomfited by the erection being placed under the patronage of St. Michael=
. The rock itself is=20

volcanic, so that the Prince of Darkness had a reason for deeming it his pr=
ivate property. The=20

church is said to have been built as a thankoffering for deliverance from t=
he sea. Those who reach=20

it have to do so by a steep and stony path, which we may take, if we will, =
as a symbol; and it is=20

often difficult to stand in the graveyard because of the fierce winds that =
beat upon it. In times of=20

storm it might be easy to imagine that St. Michael and the spirits of darkn=
ess were waging their=20

ancient conflict. Not many worshippers in England can boast that they atten=
d a church 1130 feet=20

above sea level; but the church at Princetown is higher still. Perhaps it i=
s not surprising that a=20

more accessible church has been built at North Brent Tor, yet after coming =
here it would seem like=20

a lapse in manhood to attend the other.  As we get northward of Lydford we =
approach the region=20

of Dartmoor's greatest heights. At Bairdown, near Hare Tor, there is a fine=
ly-placed monolith or=20

menhir; but the view from Great Lynx Tor is more impressive than any prehis=
toric remains can be,=20

and includes both the English and the Bristol Channels. Mist and rain may o=
ften obscure the=20

outlook, but there are clear times when the waters beyond Plymouth Sound ca=
n be seen to the=20

south, while to the north glimmers the Severn Sea where it meets the Atlant=
ic Ocean. The two=20

highest tors lie beyond Lynx--Yes Tor and High Willhayes; both of these, th=
ough High Willhayes=20

has a slight advantage, are well over 2000 feet.  The grand Tavy Cleave, on=
e of the famous=20

beauty spots of the moor, is just south of Amicombe Hill. The Tavy, one of =
the many rivers that=20

spring from the morasses around occupied in going and returning; so that if=
 Jack Huysen meant to=20

do anything with the verses it was about time that that should appear.  And=
 the more she thought=20

of it the more she set her heart on it, and hoped that Ronald's introductio=
n to the reading public=20

would be a flattering one and one of which he could reasonably be proud.  H=
er father had it in his=20

power to secure his material advancement; and that was well enough; but wha=
t if it were reserved=20

for her to confer a far greater service on him? For if this first modest ef=
fort were welcomed in a=20

friendly way, might he not be induced to put forth a volume, and claim a wi=
der recognition?  It need=20

not interfere with his more practical work; and then, supposing it were suc=
cessful?  Look at the=20

status it would win for him--a thing of far more value in the old country, =
where society is gradated=20

into ranks, than in her country, where every one (except hotel clerks, as s=
he insisted) was on the=20

same plane. He would then be the equal of anybody--even in this old England=
; she had at least=20

acquired so far a knowledge of English society.  And if he owed the first s=
uggestion and impulse to=20

her?--if she were to be the means, in however small and tentative a fashion=
, of his ultimately=20

establishing his fame?  That he could do so if he tried, she never thought =
of doubting.  She saw=20

him every day, and the longer she knew him the more she was certain that th=
e obvious mental=20

force that seemed to radiate from him in the ordinary conversation and disc=
ussion of everyday life=20

only wanted to be put into a definite literary channel to make its mark.  A=
nd was not the time ripe=20

for a poet? And it was not Edinburgh, or Glasgow, or London that had nowada=
ys to decide on his=20



merits, but two great continents of English-speaking people.  At length cam=
e the answer to her=20

urgent prayer--a letter from Miss Kerfoot and a copy of the _Chicago Citize=
n_. The newspaper she=20

opened first; saw with delight that a long notice--a very long notice indee=
d--had been accorded to=20

the verses she had sent; and with a proud heart she put the paper in her po=
cket, for careful=20

reading when she should get down to the lake.  Miss Kerfoot's letter she gl=
anced over; but it did=20

not say much; the writer observed that Mr. Jack Huysen had only seemed half=
 pleased when=20

informed of Carry's extraordinary interest in the=20


_
cooling stream, in winter an impetuous torrent--among scattered boulders an=
d crags at the foot of=20

the bare hills. Very different is this scene from Lydford Gorge, but far mo=
re typically moorland.=20

There is no woodland here, but the gaunt flanks of granite upheavals, and a=
 restless stream=20

gushing through stark lichened rocks. Grim summits cap the ravine; below ar=
e bogs that in wet=20

seasons may be formidable.  Of the peril of losing one's way on Dartmoor we=
 learn something=20

when we come to Amicombe Hill. Here are the stones known as Bronescombe's L=
oaf and=20

Cheese, which call to memory an adventure of Bronescombe, Bishop of Exeter =
in the thirteenth=20

century, whose tomb is in the Cathedral. He was much beloved of the people,=
 and the part that he=20

plays in folklore proves how strongly he impressed his personality upon the=
m. It is said that the=20

bishop and his chaplain lost their way in crossing the moorland, and at las=
t found themselves on=20

Amicombe Hill. Tired and hungry, the former said to his companion: "Our Mas=
ter, when tempted in=20

the wilderness, was offered bread created from the stones. If the same offe=
r was made to me, I=20

doubt if I could refuse."  "Bread with a hunch of cheese as well," suggeste=
d the equally hungry=20

chaplain.  "Ah," sighed the bishop, "I could not hold out against bread and=
 cheese!"  While he was=20

still speaking, a limping moorman suddenly appeared, with a wallet on his b=
ack, and the chaplain=20

eagerly asked if he had any food to give them.  "Aye," replied the man, "I =
have some bread and=20

cheese--naught else."  "Give it to us, my son," exclaimed the bishop. "I wi=
ll repay thee well." But=20

the stranger answered that he desired no payment; he only asked that the bi=
shop would alight=20

from his pony and doff his cap, saluting him as master. The bishop was abou=
t to comply, when his=20

comrade noticed that one of the stranger's feet had a curious appearance. I=
n great alarm he cried=20

to the bishop, who hurriedly made the sign of the cross. Immediately the st=
ranger vanished, and=20

the loaf and cheese that he had produced were converted into the stones tha=
t we see here.=20

[Illustration: BRENT TOR                  (_Page 26_)]  It is a fashion to =
go to Cranmere, and even to=20

leave a card as proof that the visit has been paid; but the bogs and mires =
that surround it always=20

make the approach difficult--in wet seasons dangerous; and except as the so=
urce of so many=20

Devon rivers the spot is really unattractive. It is never more than a marsh=
y pool, and sometimes=20

scarcely that. Dartmoor is one of the rainiest spots in England, its height=
 being swept by the=20

moisture-laden winds from both seas; and the rainfall is held in its high-l=
ying hollows by peat bogs.=20

Every hollow is like a granite cup, and where there is not the immediate gr=
anite, there is the=20

equally impervious china-clay of its denudations; these basins are perpetua=
lly fed by rain or mists,=20

and the rivers thus born never run dry. From the actual pool of Cranmere ri=
ses the West Ockment,=20

while the East Ockment, the Tavy, the Dart, the Taw, and the Teign spring f=
rom morasses or=20

quags in its neighbourhood. No other spot in the kingdom gives birth to so =
many rivers of the=20

_Citizen_, she said Jack Huysen had entrusted the writing of it to Mr. G. Q=
uincy Regan, who was,=20

she understood, one of the most cultured young men in Chicago, and likely t=
o make quite a=20

reputation for himself ere long.  There were some other matters mentioned i=
n this letter; but they=20

need not detain us here.  Miss Carry was in very high spirits as she set fo=
rth from the inn with her=20

father to walk down to the boats.  They met Ronald, too, on their way; he w=
as accompanied by the=20

man who was to take his place after his leaving; and Miss Carry could not h=
elp comparing the two=20

of them as they came along the road.  But, after all, it was not outward ap=
pearance that made the=20

real difference between men; it was mental stature; she had that in her poc=
ket which could show=20

to everybody how Ronald was a head and shoulders over any of his peers.  An=
d she took but little=20



interest in the setting up of the rods or the selection of the minnows; she=
 wanted to be out on the=20

lake, alone, in the silence, to read line by line and word by word this int=
roduction of her hero to the=20

public.  The following is the article:  'A REMARKABLE LITERARY DISCOVERY--O=
UR FELLOW-

CITIZENS ABROAD--ANOTHER RUSTIC POET--CHICAGO CLAIMS HIM.  It may be in the=
=20

recollection of some of our readers that a few years ago a small party of A=
merican tourists,=20

consisting of Curtis H. Mack, who was one of our most distinguished major-g=
enerals in the=20

rebellion, and is now serving on the Indian frontier; his niece, Miss Hetti=
e F. Doig, a very talented=20

lady and contributor to several of our best periodicals; and John Grimsby P=
atterson, editor of the=20

Baltimore _Evening News_, were travelling in Europe, when they had the good=
 fortune to discover=20

an Irish poet, Patrick Milligan, who had long languished in obscurity, no d=
oubt the victim of British=20

jealousy as well as of misrule. Major-General Mack interested himself in th=
is poor man, and, in=20

conjunction with William B. Stevens, of Cleveland, Ohio, had him brought ov=
er to this country,=20

where they were eventually successful in obtaining for him a postmastership=
 in New Petersburg,=20

Conn., leaving him to devote such time as he pleased to the service of the =
tuneful nine. Mr.=20

Milligan's Doric reed has not piped to us much of late years; but we must a=
ll remember the stirring=20

verses which he wrote on the occasion of Colonel George W. Will's nominatio=
n for Governor of=20

Connecticut.  It has now been reserved for another party of American travel=
lers, still better known=20

to us than the above, for they are no other than our esteemed fellow-citize=
n, Mr. Josiah Hodson=20

and his brilliant and accomplished daughter, Miss Caroline Hodson, to make =
a similar discovery in=20

the Highlands of Scotland; and in view of such recurring instances, we may =
well ask whether there=20

be not in the mental alertness of our newer civilisation a capacity for the=
 detection and recognition=20

of intellectual merit which exists not among the deadening influences of an=
 older and exhausted=20

civilisation. It has sometimes been charged against this country that we do=
 not excel in arts and=20

letters; that we are in a measure careless of them; that political problems=
 and material=20


_
for their great beauty though only slightly for their navigation. On the mo=
or itself they are rapid=20

streams, sometimes peat-stained, yet always limpid; and this rapidity, espe=
cially after rainfall, goes=20

with them to their estuaries, bringing sometimes sudden and dangerous risin=
gs of tide. The=20

general Dartmoor watershed is southward; all the streams but the Ockments a=
nd the Taw flow to=20

the English Channel. Teignmouth, Dartmouth, Plymouth, are watered by Dartmo=
or rivers.  Though=20

the mother and nurse of these rivers, Cranmere is disappointing; yet it has=
 loomed large in local=20

folklore. Like Dosmare of the Bodmin Moors, it has been supposed to be bott=
omless; and the fate=20

of doomed spirits has been to drain it with a leaky shell. One tale is of a=
n old farmer who, after=20

death, here had to expiate his misdoings. His ghost was so troublesome that=
 it took seven parsons=20

to secure it. Being changed into a colt by their pious spells, a servant la=
d was told to lead him to=20

Cranmere pool, take off the halter, and leave the place instantly, without =
glancing back. The boy=20

obeyed all the instructions but the last; and on looking back he least, is =
in no hurry to repel that=20

charge, odious as it may seem to some.  We, as Americans, should remember t=
hat the Athenian=20

Republic, with which our western Republic has nothing to fear in the way of=
 comparison, when it=20

boasted its most lavish display of artistic and literary culture, was no le=
ss conspicuous for its moral=20

degeneracy and political corruption.  It was in the age of Pericles and of =
Phidias, of Socrates and=20

Sophocles, of Euripides and Aristophanes and Thucydides, that Athens showed=
 herself most=20

profligate; private licence was unbridled; justice was bought and sold; gen=
erals incited to war that=20

they might fill their pockets out of the public purse; and all this spectac=
le in striking contrast with=20

the manly virtues of the rude and unlettered kingdom of Sparta, whose envoy=
s were laughed at=20

because they had not the trick of Athenian oratory and casuistry. We say, t=
hen, that we are not=20

anxious to repel this charge brought against our great western Republic, th=
at we assign to arts and=20

letters a secondary place; on the contrary, we are content that the over-cu=
ltivation of these should=20

fatten on the decaying and=20


_
colt, which then plunged into the pool in the form of a ball of fire.  We a=
re indebted to the Ockment=20

Rivers for the name of Okehampton (in Domesday the name is Ochementone), wh=
ich is perhaps=20

the best centre from which to explore the northern moorland. But the phosph=
orus shines in rotten=20

wood.'  Now she had determined to read every sentence of this article consc=
ientiously, as=20

something more than a mere intellectual treat; but, as she went on, joy did=
 not seem to be the=20

result.  The reference to Patrick Milligan and the=20
