[_Persuasively._] Here, girl, take this pearl necklace. You must go and giv=

good wife. And give her this message: "Worthy Charudatta's virtues have won=
 me, made me his=20

slave, and therefore your slave also. And so I hope that these pearls may a=
dorn your neck."  [94.3.=20

angry.  _Maid._ [_Takes the necklace._] Yes, mistress. [_She goes out, then=
 returns._] Mistress,=20

 be right for her to accept=20

it. And further, that you are to know that her lord and husband is her most=
 excellent adornment.=20

[_Enter Radanika, with Charudatta's little son._]  _Radanika._ Come, dear, =
let's play with your little=20

cart.  _Rohasena._ [_Peevishly._] I don't like this little clay cart, Radan=

masterpiece and a model.  The subject of the _Provinciales_ is in part a th=

_Pensees_ deal with problems which can never lose their interest. Among Pas=
cal's papers were=20

found, after his early death, many fragments which his sister, Madame Perie=
r, and his friends=20

recognised as of rare value; but the editors of the little volume which app=
eared in 1670, imagining=20

that they could safeguard its orthodoxy, and even amend its style, freely o=
mitted and altered what=20

Pascal had written. It was not until 1844 that a complete and genuine text =
was established in the=20

edition of M. Faugere. We can hardly hope to arrange the fragments so as to=
 exhibit the design of=20

that apology for Christianity, with which many of them were doubtless conne=
cted, but the main=20

outlines of Pascal's body of thought can be clearly discerned.  The intelle=

heart happy.  _Radanika._ This is Charudatta's son, Rohasena.  _Vasantasena=

her arms._] Come, my boy, and put your little arms around me. [_She takes h=

looks just like his father.  _Radanika._ More than looks like him, he _is_ =
like him. At least I think=20

so. His father is perfectly devoted to him.  _Vasantasena._ But what is he =
crying about?=20

_Radanika._ He used to play with a gold cart that belongs to the son of a n=
eighbor. But that was=20

taken away, and when he asked for it, I made him this little clay cart. But=
 when I gave it to him, he=20

said "I don't like this little clay cart, Radanika. Give me my gold cart." =

Oh, dear! To think that this little fellow has to suffer because others are=
 wealthy. Ah, mighty Fate!=20

leaf, seem to thee but=20

playthings! [_Tearfully._] Don't cry, my child. You shall have a gold cart =
to play with.  _Rohasena._=20

Who is she, Radanika?  _Vasantasena._ A slave of your father's, won by his =
virtues.  _Radanika._=20

My child, the lady is your mother.  _Rohasena._ That's a lie, Radanika. If =
the lady is my mother,=20

these could find by its own researches no certitude in the sphere of philos=
ophy and religion. He=20

had been deeply influenced by the sceptical mind of Montaigne. He found wit=
hin him a passionate=20

craving for certitude; man is so constituted that he can never be at rest u=
ntil he rests in knowledge=20

of the truth; but man, as he now exists, is incapable of ascertaining truth=
; he is weak and=20

miserable, and yet the very consciousness of his misery is evidence of his =
greatness; "Nature=20

confounds the Pyrrhonist, and reason the dogmatist;" "Man is but a reed, th=
e feeblest of created=20

things, but a reed which thinks." How is this riddle of human nature to be =
explained? Only in one=20

way--by a recognition of the truth taught by religion, that human nature is=
 fallen from its true=20

estate, that man is a dethroned king. And how is the dissonance in man's na=
ture to be overcome?=20

Only in one way--through union with God made man; with Jesus Christ, the ce=
ntre in which alone=20

we find our weakness and the divine strength. Through Christ man is abased =
and lifted up--

abased without despair, and lifted up without pride; in Him all contradicti=
ons are reconciled. Such,=20

in brief, is the vital thought from which Pascal's apologetic proceeds. It =
does not ignore any of the=20

external evidences of Christianity; but the irresistible evidence is that d=
erived from the problem of=20

human nature and the essential needs of the spirit--a problem which religio=
n alone can solve, and=20

needs which Christ alone can satisfy. Pascal's "Thoughts" are those of an e=
minent intelligence.=20

But they are more than thoughts; they are passionate lyrical cries of a hea=
rt which had suffered,=20

and which had=20


_
_Rohasena._ Go away! I won't take them. You're crying.  _Vasantasena._ [_Wi=
ping away her=20

tears._] I'll not cry, dear. There! go and play. [_She fills the clay cart =
with her jewels._] There, dear,=20

you must have a little gold cart made for you.                             =

pretation of the words=20

of his amulet--"Joie, joie, joie, pleurs de joie." The union of the ardour =
of a poet or a saint with the=20

scientific rigour of a great geometer, of wit and brilliance with a sublime=
 pathos, is among the=20

rarest phenomena in literature; all this and more is found in Pascal.     C=

than for the theatre. With a gift for style, and a lyrical talent, seen not=
 only in the chants of the=20

chorus, but in the general character of his dramas, he had little feeling f=
