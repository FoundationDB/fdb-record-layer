At the closing of the war, word was sent around among the slaves that if th=
ey heard the report of a=20

gun, it was the Yankees and that they were free.  It was in May, in the mid=
dle of the day, cotton=20

and corn being planted, plowing going on, and slaves busily engaged in thei=
r usual activities, when=20

suddenly the loud report of a gun resounded, then could be heard the slaves=
 crying almost en-

masse, "dems de Yankees." Straightway they dropped the plows, hoes and othe=
r farm implements=20

and hurried to their cabins. They put on their best clothes "to go see the =
Yankees." Through the=20

countryside to the town of Tallahassee they went. The roads were quickly fi=
lled with these happy=20

souls. The streets of Tallahassee were clustered with these jubilant people=
 going here and there to=20

get a glimpse of the Yankees, their liberators. Napoleon says it was a joyo=
us and un-forgetable=20

occasion.  When the Randolph slaves returned to their plantation, Dr. Rando=
lph told them that=20

they were free, and if they wanted to go away, they could, and if not, they=
 could remain with him=20

and he would give them half of what was raised on the farms. Some of them l=
eft, however, some=20

onnection between=20

Church and State has ceased to exist, without any diminution of the strengt=
h of the religious=20

sentiment  Whether there is anything deserving of attention in these brief =
remarks or not, one thing=20

may safely be affirmed: it is time that the question as to the existence of=
 a rational basis for=20

religion and the reality of spiritual life should be studied, not merely wi=
th a view of overthrowing the=20

superstitions of the past, but of providing, if possible, a faith for the p=
resent and the future. The=20

battle of criticism and science against superstition has been won, as every=
 open-minded observer=20

of the contest must be aware, though the remnants of the broken host still =
linger on the field. It is=20

now time to consider whether religion must perish with superstition, or whe=
ther the death of=20

superstition may not be the new birth of religion. Religion survived the fa=
ll of Polytheism; it is=20

surely conceivable that it may survive the fall of Anthropomorphism, and th=
at the desperate=20

struggle which is being waged about the formal belief in "Personality," may=

government to his former master, Colonel Sammis of Arlington, and there he =
lived for awhile. He=20

soon got employment with a Mr. Hatee of the town and after earning enough m=
oney, bought a=20

tract of land from him there and farmed. There his family lived and increas=

d mother having died=20

many years ago. He now lives with one of his younger brothers who has a fai=
r sized orange grove=20

on the south side of Jacksonville. He retains the property that his father =
first bought after freedom=20

and on which they lived in Arlington. His hair white and he is bent with ag=
e and ill health but his=20

mental faculties are vital to religion.  There are some who would deter us =
from inquiring into=20

anything beyond the range of sensible experience, and especially from any i=
nquiry into the future=20

existence of the soul, which they denounce as utterly unpractical, and comp=
are with obsolete and=20

fruitless inquiries into the state of the soul before birth. We have alread=
y challenged the exclusive=20

claim of the five bodily senses to be the final sources of knowledge; and w=
e may surely add that it=20

is at least as practical to inquire into the destiny as it is to inquire in=
to the origin of man.  If the=20

belief in God and in a Future State is true, it will prevail. The cloud wil=
l pass away and the sun will=20

shine out again. But in the meantime society may have "a bad quarter of an =
hour." Without=20

exaggerating the influence of the belief in Future Reward and Punishment, o=
r of any form of it, on=20

the actions of ordinary men, we may safely say that the sense of responsibi=
lity to a higher power,=20

and of the constant presence of an all-seeing Judge, has exercised an influ=
ence, the removal of=20

its effects on human=20
