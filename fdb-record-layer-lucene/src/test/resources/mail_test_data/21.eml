IONS OF A FEW=20

PRISONERS   Like all other penitentiaries, the Minnesota State Prison conta=
ins its quota of=20

inmates who are slightly demented, or who have periodical fits of hallucina=
tions. When these=20

unfortunates give oral demonstrations in the evening after the prisoners ha=
ve retired and all is=20

quiet for the night they furnish considerable amusement. Their mental state=
, of course, is deplored=20

by all, and it is only their language that arouses the risibilities of fell=
ow prisoners.   THE=20

TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.   One of these men imagined himself to be an operator i=
n St. Paul;=20

that he had a train going out and one coming in on the same Colour; and the=
n your Pickles will eat=20

the firmer and keep the longer, when they are not too soon brought to Colou=
r.  In this Month we=20

have the Morello and Black Cherry ripe, which both are pleasant in Brandy; =
to those who would=20

have Drams by them, the way of making Black-Cherry Brandy, is only to pick =
the Cherries from the=20

Stalks, and put them whole into the Brandy, about a Pound of Cherries to a =
Quart; this may remain=20

for about a Month before it is fit to drink, and then the Brandy may be pou=
r'd from the Cherries,=20

and the Cherries put then into a Vessel of Ale will make it extremely stron=
g, only about the=20

proportion of a Pound of Cherries to a Gallon of Ale; but some will put fre=
sh Brandy to them, and=20

the Cherries will turn the Brandy of a deep Colour, and give it a strong ta=
ste of Ratafia; others will=20

distill these Cherries in a cold Still, with as much Water as will cover th=
em, and draw a fine Cordial=20

from them.    To make Visney.  This Visney is made of pure Brandy, and as m=
any Morello Cherries=20



as will fill the Bottles or Casks, with one Ounce of Loaf-Sugar to each ful=
l Quart; these Vessels or=20

Bottles must be gently stopp'd, when the Cherries are put in, and stand in =
a cool Cellar for two=20

Months before the Liquor is poured from them, and then the Liquor may be pu=
t in small Bottles for=20

use: It is not very strong, but very pleasant. The Cherries, when they are =
taken out, may be=20

distill'd, and will yield a fine Spirit.  In some places, where there are L=
aurels grow wild, without=20

Cutting or pruning, I mean, the _Lauro-Cerasus_, as we find in many old Gar=
dens, that Plant is apt=20

to bear Berries, which in reality are Cherries, from whence it has its Name=
; these Berries, or=20

Cherries, are ripe about this time, and make a fine Cordial, if we infuse t=
hem in Brandy for two or=20

three Months with a little Sugar; this will have a Flavour of Abricot Kerne=
ls, and be of a rich red=20

Colour. While I am speaking of this, I cannot help taking notice of a parti=
cular Dram which I tasted=20

at a curious Gentleman's House at _Putney_ in _Surrey_, _W. Curtis _Esq; wh=
ich he made by=20

infusing of the Cornelian Cherry in Brandy; that Gentleman is the only one =
who I think has yet tried=20

it, and to my Palate it seems to be so like _Tockay_ Wine, that it must be =
a very good judge who=20

can discover the difference. I have drank that Wine in perfection, and this=
 preparation has both the=20

Colour, Taste, and Proportion of strength equal to it; for the great streng=
th of the Brandy is lost in=20

the Cornelian Cherry, and tho' the Cornelian Cherry is of a bright red Colo=
ur, yet this Liquor is of=20

the Colour of _Tockay_ Wine.  Those who live near _London_, may, about this=
 Season, buy=20

Geese out of the Flocks, which are now drove up to that City, at about five=
 and twenty, or thirty=20

Shillings a score; and till the Season we are to turn them into the Stubble=
, we may feed them=20

chiefly with the Offals of the Garden, Lettuce especially, which will fatte=
n them, if you have=20

enough: but as for their particular Feed for fatting, I shall speak of that=
 in another place.  About this=20

Season Abricots are ripe, and where there are plenty of them, we may make a=
 pleasant Wine with=20


_
vigorously tapping away on one of the walls of his cell when a night guard =
asked him what=20

troubled him. "This," said the prisoner in all seriousness, "is a telegraph=
 station in St. Paul." "Well,=20

you had better cut this out and go to bed; the prisoners can't sleep with a=
ll this fuss going on."=20

"Fuss nothing," angrily retorted the prisoner, "I'm attending strictly to b=
usiness! The Governor is on=20

one of those trains and if there is a wreck there will be trouble!"  The ca=
ptain of the night watch=20

immediately sent for the deputy warden one.    To make Apricot Wine. From M=
rs. _J. L._  To every=20

Quart of Water put a Pound and half of Apricots, that are not over-ripe, le=
t them be wiped clean,=20

and cut in pieces; boil these till the Liquor is strong of the Apricot Flav=
our; then strain the Liquor=20

thro' a Sieve, and put to every Quart four or five Ounces of white Sugar, b=
oil it again, and scum it=20

as it rises, and when the Scum rises no more, pour it into an Earthen Pot; =
the Day following bottle=20

it, putting into every Bottle a lump of Loaf-Sugar, as big as a Nutmeg. Thi=
s=20


_
suppress the "operator," who, when he arrived, and after a sharp command to=
 be quiet, without=20

glancing up from his "key" ordered the deputy to go away and "not interrupt=
 him." Of course this=20

rejoinder caused the other inmates to burst out laughing, and no amount of =
drinking, is a very=20

pleasant Liquor; but will not keep long.         *       *       *       * =
      *  AUGUST.  In this Month there=20

are many Delicacies about a Country Seat; all kinds of Pond-Fish are good, =
there is plenty of=20

Poultry of all kinds, wild and tame, except the=20


_
their merriment. By this time it was necessary to open the cell door and ta=
ke the operator bodily=20

from his "key" and transfer him to the observation ward at the solitary. Ju=
st as he was relieved=20

from "duty" he shrieked at the deputy, "You will catch h-- if those two tra=
ins come together!"   THE=20

BEDBUG INCIDENT.   For some unaccountable reason the cellhouse building is =
infested with=20

bedbugs, notwithstanding the fact that every effort is made to exterminate =
them. An afflicted=20

prisoner one day stepped up to the deputy warden, respectfully gave the cus=
tomary military salute,=20

and, with a Pheasant Poults, Partridges, and some sort of Pigeons, are good=
; but for the most part=20

the Dove-cote Pigeons are distemper'd, and are now full of Knots in their S=
kins, and=20

unwholesome. The Eggs of Fowls likewise at this Season, as well as in the f=
ormer Month, are=20

unhealthful. Towards the end, Pork comes again in Season, and young Pigs al=
so are pretty=20

plentiful; 'tis a good time likewise to save young Pigs to grow up for now =
you may turn them with=20

their Dams into the Stubbles, and soon after into the Woods. About the end =
of this Month, you=20

have Rabbets full grown in common Warrens,=20
