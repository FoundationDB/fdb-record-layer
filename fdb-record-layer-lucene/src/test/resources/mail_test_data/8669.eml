revived and restored the culture of Greece and Rome, was another humanism which was 

essentially national. The historical origins of France were studied for the first time with something 

of a critical spirit by CLAUDE FAUCHET in his _Antiquites Gauloises et Francoises_ (1579-1601). 

His _Recueil de l'Origine de la Langue et Poesie Francoise_, in spite of its errors, was an effort 

towards French philology; and in calling attention to the trouveres and their works, Fauchet may 

be considered a remote master of the school of modern literary research. ESTIENNE PASQUIER 

(1529-1615), the jurist who maintained in a famous action the cause of the University against the 

Jesuits, in his _Recherches de la France_ treated with learning and vigour various important 

points in French history--civil and ecclesiastical--language, literary history, and the foundation of 

universities.

[_He anoints himself._] Alas, I have forgotten my measuring line. [_Reflecting._] Aha! This sacred 

cord[48] shall be my measuring line. Yes, the sacred cord is a great blessing to a Brahman, 

especially to one like me. For, you see,      With this he measures, ere he pierce a wall,       And 

picks the lock, when jewels are at stake.     It serves as key to bolted door and hall,       As 

tourniquet for bite of worm and snake.                  16  The measuring is done. I begin my task. [_He 

does so, then takes a look._] My breach lacks but a single brick. Alas, I am bitten by a snake. [_He 

binds his finger with the sacred cord, and manifests the workings of poison._] I have applied the 

remedy, and now I am restored. [_He continues his work, then gazes._] Ah, there burns a candle. 

See!      Though jealous darkness hems it round,       The golden-yellow candle from its place 

Shines through the breach upon the ground,       Like a streak of gold upon the touchstone's face.

enter yet. I will shove a dummy in. [_He does so._] Ah, no one is there. Praise be to Skanda! [_He 

enters and looks about._] See! Two men asleep. Come, for my own protection I will open the door. 

But the house is old and the door squeaks. I must look for water. Now where might water be? [_He 

looks about, finds water, and sprinkles the door. Anxiously._] I hope it will not fall upon the floor 

and make a noise. Come, this is the way. [_He puts his back against the door and opens it 

cautiously._] Good! So much for that. Now I must discover whether these two are feigning sleep, 

or whether they are the intoxication of classical humanism, was patriotic in his reverence for his 

native tongue. In a trilogy of little treatises (1565-79), written with much spirit, he maintained that of 

modern languages the French has the nearest affinity to the Greek, attempted to establish its 

superiority to Italian, and much more to Spanish, and mocked the contemporary fashion of 

Italianised French.  The study of history is supported on the one hand by such erudite research as 

that of Fauchet and Pasquier; on the other hand it is supported by political philosophy and 

speculation. To philosophy, in the wider sense of the word, the sixteenth century made no large 

and coherent contribution; the Platonism, Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism, Stoicism of the Renaissance 

met and clashed together; the rival theologies of the Roman and Reformed Churches contended 

in a struggle for life. PIERRE DE LA RAMEE (1515-72) expressed the revolt of rationalism against 

the methods of the schoolmen and the authority of Aristotle; but he ordinarily wrote in Latin, and 

his _Dialectique_, the first philosophical work in the vulgar tongue, hardly falls within the province 

of literary history.  The philosophy of politics is represented by one great name, that of JEAN 

BODIN (1529-96), whose _Republique_ may entitle him to be styled the Montesquieu of the 

Renaissance. In an age which tended towards the formation of great monarchies he was 

vigorously monarchical. The patriarchal power of the sovereign might well be thought needful, in 

the second half of the century, as a barrier against anarchy; but Bodin was no advocate of tyranny; 

he condemned slavery, and held that religious persecution can only lead to a dissolution of

term. [_He tries to terrify them, and notes the effect._] Yes, they must be asleep in the fullest 

meaning of the term. For see!      Their breath first calmly rises, ere it sink;       Its regularity all fear 

defies.       Unmoving in their socket-holes, the eyes     Are tightly closed, and never seem to wink. 

The limbs relaxed, at ease the bodies lie,       I see their feet beyond the bedstead peep,     The 

lighted candle vexes not the eye;       It would, if they were only feigning sleep.                18  [_He 

looks about him._] What! a a free man under the supreme government of another; like 

Montesquieu, he devotes attention to the adaptation of government to the varieties of race and 

climate. The attempts at a general history of France in the earlier part of the sixteenth century 

preserved the arid methods and unilluminated style of the mediaeval chronicles;[3] in the second 

half of the century they imitated with little skill the models of antiquity. Histories of contemporary 

events in Europe were written with conscientious impartiality by Lancelot de la Popeliniere, and
