"That's what he is," added Glen Forker, another crony of the bully.  "Am I? Just wait," was all Nat 

answered as he rubbed his ribs. "Slithering side saddles! but you gave me a dig!"  The contestants 

were now rowing more rapidly, and the students on shore, who were following the race, had to 

increase their pace to keep up to them.  "Hit it up a little, Jack!" called Sam. "You've got him 

breathing hard."  "He has--not! I'm--I'm all right," answered Dock from his boat, and very foolishly, 

too, for he was getting winded, and he needed to save all his breath, and not waste it in talking. 

Besides, the halting manner in which he answered showed his condition. Sam noticed it at once. 

"You've got him! You've got him, Jack!" he cried exultantly. "Go on! Row hard!"  "Say, that ain't 

fair!" cried Pud Armstrong.  "What isn't?" asked Sam.  "Telling Jack like that. Let him find out about 

Dock."  "I guess I know what's fair," replied Sam with a withering look. "I'll call all I want to, and 

don't you interfere with me, or it won't be healthy for you."  Pud subsided. Sam Chalmers was the 

foremost authority, among the students, on everything connected with games and sports, for he 

played on the football eleven, on the nine, and was a general leader.  "You'd better hit it up a bit, 

Dock," was Glen Forker's advice to his crony, as he saw Jack's lead increasing. "Beat him good 

and proper."  "He'll have to get up earlier in the morning if he wants to do that," commented Bony 

Balmore, as he cracked his big knuckles in his excitement.  And it was high time for Dock to do 

some rowing. Jack had not been unaware of his rival's difficulty, and deciding that the best way to 

win the race would be to make a spurt and tire him out before the finish, he "hit up a faster clip," 

the broad blades of the oars dipping into the water, coming out and going in again with scarcely a 

ripple.  "There he goes! There he goes!" cried Sam. "That's the ticket, Jack!"  "Go on! Go on!" 

yelled Nat.  "Get right after him, Dock," advised Pud.  "You can beat him! Do it!" cried Glen.  But it 

was easier said than done. Jack was rowing his best, and when our hero did that it was "going 

some," as Sam used to say. He had opened up quite a stretch of water between his boat and 

Dock's, and the bully, with a quick glance over his shoulder, seeing this, resolved to close it up 

and then pass his rival. There was less than a quarter of a mile to the finish, and he must needs 

row hard if he was to win.  Dock bent to the task. He was a powerfully built lad, and had he been in 

good condition there is no question but what he could have beaten Jack. But cigarette-smoking, 

an occasional bottle of beer, late hours and too much rich food had made him fat, and anything but 

an ideal athlete.  Still he had plenty of "row" left in him yet, as he demonstrated a few seconds 

later, when by increasing not only the number of his strokes per minute, but also putting more 

power into them, he crept up on Jack, until he was even with him.  Jack rowed the same rate he 

had settled on to pull until he was within a short distance of the finish. He was saving himself for a 

spurt.  Suddenly Dock's boat crept a little past Jack's.  "There he goes! There he goes!" cried Pud, 

capering about on the bank in delight. "What did I tell you?"  "He'll win easy," was Glen's opinion. 

"It isn't over yet," remarked Nat quietly, but he glanced anxiously at Sam, who shook his head in a 

reassuring manner.  Dock began to increase his lead. Jack looked over his shoulder for one 

glance at his rival's boat. The two were now rowing well and swiftly.  "Go on, Jack! Go on! Go on!" 

begged Bony, cracking his eight fingers and two thumbs in rapid succession, like a battery of 

popguns. "Don't let him beat you!"  Dock was now a boat's length ahead, and rowing well, but a 

critical observer could notice that his breathing distressed him.  "Now's your chance, Jack!" yelled 

Sam.  But Jack did not need any one to tell him. Another glance over his shoulder at his rival 

showed him that the time had come to make the spurt. He leaned forward, took a firmer grip on 



the ash handles, and then gave such an exhibition of rowing as was seldom seen at Washington 

Hall.  Dock saw his enemy coming, and tried to stave off defeat, but it was no use. He was 

completely fagged out. Jack went right past him, "as if Dock was standing still," was the way Sam 

expressed it.  "Go on! Go on!" screamed Pud. "You've got to row, Dock!"  But Dock could not 

imitate the pace that Jack had set. He tried, but the effort was saddening. He splashed, and the 

oars all but slipped from his hands. His heart was fluttering like that of a wounded bird.  "You've 

got him! You've got him, Jack!" yelled Nat; and, sure enough, Jack Ranger had.  On and on he 

rowed, increasing every second the open water between his boat and his rival's, until he shot past 

the Point, a winner by several lengths.  "That's the way to do it!"  "I knew he'd win!"  "Three cheers 

for Jack Ranger!"  These, and other cries of victory, regret that they refused to listen to Don 

Domingo Tovar, and other right-thinking men, who, as early as the year 1795, lifted up their voices 

in the cabildo of Caracas, to prevent the introduction of blacks, and to propose means that might 

ameliorate their condition.  After having slept on the 10th of June in an island in the middle of the 

river (I believe that called Acaru by Father Caulin), we passed the mouth of the Rio Caura. This, 

the Aruy and the Carony, are the largest tributary streams which the Orinoco receives on its right 

bank. All the Christian settlements are near the mouth of the river; and the villages of San Pedro, 

Aripao, Urbani, and Guaraguaraico, succeed each other at the distance of a few leagues. The first 

and the most populous contains only about two hundred and fifty souls. San Luis de 

Guaraguaraico is a colony of negroes, some freed and others fugitives from Essequibo. This 

colony merits the particular attention of the Spanish Government, for it can never be sufficiently 

recommended to endeavour to attach the slaves to the soil, and suffer them to enjoy as farmers 

the fruits of their agricultural labours. The land on the Caura, for the most part a virgin soil, is 

extremely fertile. There are pasturages for more than 15,000 beasts; but the poor inhabitants have 

neither horses nor horned cattle. More than five-sixths of the banks of the Caura are either desert, 

or occupied by independent and savage tribes. The bed of the river is twice choked up by rocks: 

these obstructions occasion the famous Raudales of Mura and of Para or Paru, the latter of which 

has a portage, because it cannot be passed by canoes. At the time of the expedition of the 

boundaries, a small fort was erected on the northern cataract, that of Mura; and the governor, Don 

Manuel Centurion, gave the name of Ciudad de San Carlos to a few houses which some families, 

consisting of whites and mulattos, had constructed near the fort. South of the cataract of Para, at 

the confluence of the Caura and the Erevato, the mission of San Luis was then situated; and a 

road by land led thence to Angostura, the capital of the province. All these attempts at civilization 

have been fruitless. No village now exists above the Raudal of Mura; and here, as in many other 

parts of the colonies, the natives may be said to have reconquered the country from the 

Spaniards. The valley of Caura may become one day or other highly interesting from the value of 

its productions, and the communications which it affords with the Rio Ventuari, the Carony, and 

the Cuyuni. I have shown above the importance of the four tributary streams which the Orinoco 

receives from the mountains of Parima. Near the mouth of the Caura, between the villages of San 

Pedro de Alcantara and San Francisco de Aripao, a small lake of four hundred toises in diameter 

was formed in 1790, by the sinking of the ground, consequent on an earthquake. It was a portion 

of the forest of Aripao, which sunk to the depth of eighty or a hundred feet below the level of the 

neighbouring land. The trees remained green for several months; and some of them, it was 



believed, continued to push forth leaves beneath the water. This phenomenon is the more worthy 

of attention as the soil of these countries is probably granitic. I doubt the secondary formations of 

the Llanos being continued southward as far as the valley of Caura.  On the 11th of June we 

landed on the right bank of the Orinoco at Puerto de los Frailes, at the distance of three leagues 

above the Ciudad de la Piedra, to take altitudes of the sun. The longitude of this point is 67 

degrees 26 minutes 20 seconds, or 1 degree 41 minutes east of the mouth of the Apure. Farther 

on, between the towns of La Piedra and Muitaco, or Real Corona, are the Torno and Boca del 

Infierno, two points formerly dreaded by travellers. The Orinoco suddenly changes its direction; it 

flows first east, then north-north-west, and then again east. A little above the Cano Marapiche, 

which opens on the northern bank, a very long island divides the river into two branches. We 

passed on the south of this island without difficulty; northward, a chain of small rocks, half covered 

at high water, forms whirlpools and rapids. This is La Boca del Infierno, and the Raudal de 

Camiseta. The first expeditions of Diego Ordaz (1531) and Alonzo de Herrera (1535) have given 

celebrity to this bar. The Great Cataracts of the Atures and Maypures were then unknown; and the 

clumsy vessels (vergantines), in which travellers persisted in going up the river, rendered the 

passage through the rapids extremely difficult. At present no apprehension is felt in ascending or 

descending the Orinoco, at any season, from its mouth as far as the confluence of the Apure and 

the Meta. The only falls of water in this space are those of Torno or Camiseta, Marimara, and 

Cariven or Carichana Vieja. Neither of these three obstacles is to be feared with experienced 

Indian pilots. I dwell on these hydrographic details because a great political and 


_
his oars to rest on the water flat, while he recovered his wind after the heart-breaking finish.  "Well, 

Dock could beat him if he was in training," said Pud doggedly.  "That's what he could," echoed 

Glen.  "Not in a thousand years!" was Nat's positive assertion.  The boys crowded to the float that 

marked the finish of the course. Jack reached it first, and stepped out of his shell, being greeted by 

his friends. Then Dock rowed slowly up. His distress showed plainly in his puffy, white face.  He 

got out clumsily, and staggered as he clambered upon the float.  "Hard luck, old man," said Jack 

good-humoredly.  "I don't want your sympathy!" snapped Dock. "I'll row you again, and I'll beat 

you!"  Jack had held out his hand, but the bully ignored it. He turned aside, and whether the float 

tilted, or whether Snaith tottered because of a cramp in his leg, was never known, but he 

staggered for a moment, tried unsuccessfully to recover his balance, and then plunged into the 

lake at one of the deepest spots, right off the float.     CHAPTER II  THE NEW BOY   "There goes 

Dock!"  "Pull him out!"  "Yes, before he gets under the float!"  "He can't swim! He's too exhausted!" 

These were some of the expressions the excited lads shouted as they surged forward to look at 

the spot where Dock had disappeared. A string of bubbles and some swirling eddies were all that 

marked the place.  The float began to tilt with the weight of so many boys on one edge.  "Stand 

back!" cried Jack Ranger. "Stand back, or we'll all be in the lake!"  They heeded his words, and 

moved toward the middle of the platform.  "Some one ought to go in after him," said Pud 

Armstrong, his teeth fairly chattering from fright and nervousness. "I--I can't swim."  "Look out!" 

cried Jack. "I'm going in!"  He began pulling off the sweater which some of the lads had helped put 

on him, when he stepped from the shell all perspiration.  He poised for an instant on the edge of 

the float, looking down into the dark waters, beneath which Dock had disappeared, and then dived 

in.  "Get one of the boats out. Maybe he won't come up near the float," ordered Sam Chalmers, 

and several connected with the communications between Angostura and the banks of the Meta 

and the Apure, two rivers that lead to the eastern side of the Cordilleras of New Grenada. The 

navigation from the mouth of the Lower Orinoco to the province of Varinas is difficult only on 

account of the current. The bed of the river nowhere presents obstacles more difficult to be 

surmounted than those of the Danube between Vienna and Linz. We meet with no great bars, no 

real cataracts, until we get above the Meta. The Upper Orinoco, therefore, with the Cassiquiare 

and the Rio Negro, forms a particular system of rivers, where the active industry of Angostura and 

the shore of Caracas will remain long unknown.  I obtained horary angles of the sun in an island in 

the midst of the Boca del Infierno, where we had set up our instruments. The longitude of this point 

according to the chronometer is 67 degrees 10 minutes 31 seconds. I attempted to determine the 

magnetic dip and intensity, but was prevented by a heavy storm of rain. As the sky again became 

serene in the afternoon, we lay down to rest that night on a vast beach, on the southern bank of 

the Orinoco, nearly in the meridian of the little town of Muitaco, or Real Corona. I found the latitude 

by three stars to be 8 degrees 0 minutes 26 seconds, and the longitude 67 degrees 5 minutes 19 

seconds. When the Observantin monks in 1752 made their first entradas on the territory of the 

Caribs, they constructed on this spot a small fort. The proximity of the lofty mountains of 

Araguacais renders Muitaco one of the most healthy places on the Lower Orinoco. There Iturriaga 

took up his abode in 1756, to repose after the fatigues of the expedition of the boundaries; and as 

he attributed his recovery to this hot rather than humid climate, the town, or more properly the 

village, of Real Corona took the name of Pueblo del Puerto sano. Going down the Orinoco more to 



the east, we left the mouth of the Rio Pao on the north, and that of the Arui on the south. The latter 

river, which is somewhat considerable, is often mentioned by Raleigh. The current of the Orinoco 

diminished in velocity as we advanced. I 


_
lake a broad barge, which could safely be used by Jack in getting Dock out of the water, if he was 

fortunate enough to find the youth.  "Queer he doesn't come up," spoke Glen in a whisper.  "Who--

Dock or Jack?" asked Bony, cracking his finger knuckles in double relays.  "Dock."  "He's too 

exhausted," replied Bony. "Can't swim. But Jack'll get him."  How long it seemed since Jack had 

dived down! The swirl he made had subsided, and the water was almost calm again. Anxiously the 

lads on the float and shore watched to see him reappear. Would he come up alone, or would he 

bring Dock with him?  "Maybe Jack hit his head on something," suggested Nat.  "Jack knows how 

to dive, and it's deep here," said Sam. "I guess he'll come up all right, but----"  He did not finish the 

sentence. At that moment there was a disturbance beneath the surface of the lake. A head 

bobbed up.  "There's Jack!" cried Bony delightedly.  A white arm shot up and began sweeping the 

water.  "He's got him!" yelled Nat. "He's got Dock!"  Sure enough, Jack had come to the surface, 

encircling in his left arm the unconscious form of Dock Snaith, while with his sturdy right he was 

swimming slowly toward the float.  "The boat! the boat! It's nearer!" cried Sam, for Jack had come 

up at some distance from the little pier and closer to the ascertain the time taken by floating bodies 

in traversing a known distance. Above Alta Gracia, near the mouth of the Rio Ujape, I had found 

the velocity of the Orinoco 2.3 feet in a second; between Muitaco and Borbon it was only 1.7 foot. 

The barometric observations made in the neighbouring steppes prove the small slope of the 

ground from the longitude of 69 degrees to the eastern coast of Guiana. We found in this country, 

on the right bank of the Orinoco, small formations of primitive grunstein, superimposed on granite 

(perhaps even embedded in the rock). We saw between Muitaco and the island of Ceiba a hill 

entirely composed of balls with concentric layers, in which we perceived a close mixture of 

hornblende and feldspar, with some traces of pyrites. The grunstein resembles that in the vicinity 

of Caracas; but it was impossible to ascertain the position of a formation which appeared to me to 

be of the same age as the granite of Parima. Muitaco was the last spot where we slept in the open 

air on the shore of the Orinoco: we proceeded along the river two nights more before we reached 

Angostura, which terminated our voyage.  It would be difficult for me to express the satisfaction we 

felt on landing at Angostura, the capital of Spanish Guiana. The inconveniences endured at sea in 

small vessels 


_
put out from shore.  Jack heard and understood. Turning, he began swimming toward the craft, 

and the lads in it rowed toward him. A few seconds later Jack had clutched the gunwale, holding 

Dock's head out of water.  Several eager hands reached down to grasp our hero.  "Take--take him 

first," he said pantingly. "I'm--I'm all right."  Dock was hauled into the boat.  "Now row ashore. I'll 

swim it," went on Jack. "Get the water out of him as soon as you can. He--he was right on the 

bottom. Struck--struck on the--on the float, I guess."  "We'll take you in," cried Bob Movel.  "Sure! 

There's lots of room," added Fred Kaler.  "No. Get Dock on shore," ordered Jack, and they 

obeyed.  Relieved of his burden, and having recovered his wind, Jack swam slowly to the float. 

The boat reached it some time ahead of him, and Dock was lifted out, while, under the direction of 

Sam Chalmers, the students administered first aid to the drowned.  Dock was turned over on his 

face, a roll of coats having been placed under his stomach to aid in forcing the water out of him. 

There was no need to remove his clothing, as he and Jack were clad only in rowing trunks and 

light shirts.  "Now turn him over on his back and hold out his tongue, fellows," directed Sam, and 

this was done, the tongue being held by Nat Anderson, who used his handkerchief to prevent it 

slipping away. This was done so that it might not fall back into the throat and prevent Dock from 

breathing.  "Now work his arms! Over his head! Press up his diaphragm and start artificial 

respiration," went on Sam, and under the ministrations of the lads, Dock soon began to breathe 

again.  He sighed, took in a long breath naturally, opened his eyes, and gasped feebly.  "He's all 

right now," said Sam in a relieved tone. "How do you feel, Dock?"  "All--right--I--guess. My head----

"  He closed his eyes again. Sam passed his hand over the prostrate lad's skull.  "He's got a nasty 

cut there," he said, as he felt of a big lump, "but I guess it's not serious. We must get him up to the 

school."  "Come on, let's carry him," suggested Nat.  "Never mind--here comes Hexter!" cried 

Bony.  As he spoke the chug-chugging of an automobile was heard, and a touring car came along 

the road down to the float. It was a machine kept at Washington Hall, and used by the teachers, 

and, occasionally, when Hexter, the chauffeur, would allow it, by the students.  "Dr. Mead sent me 

down to see what the matter was," said Hexter as he stopped the car. "He saw a crowd on the 

float and thought something might have happened."  "There has," replied Sam. "Here, Hexter, help 

us get Dock into the car, and then throw on all the speed you've got, if you have to blow out a 

spark-plug."  "Is he--is he dead?" asked Hexter quickly.  "No; only stunned. Lively, now!"  Hexter 

aided the boys in lifting Dock into the machine, and then he made speed to the school, where the 

injured comparison with those that are suffered under a burning sky, surrounded by swarms of 

mosquitos, and lying stretched in a canoe, without the possibility of taking the least bodily 

exercise. In seventy-five days we had performed a passage of five hundred leagues (twenty to a 

degree) on the five great rivers, Apure, Orinoco, Atabapo, Rio Negro, and Cassiquiare; and in this 

vast extent we had found but a very small number of inhabited places. After the life we had led in 

the woods, our dress was not in the very best order, yet nevertheless M. Bonpland and I hastened 

to present ourselves to Don Felipe de Ynciarte, the governor of the province of Guiana. He 

received us in the most cordial manner, and lodged us in the house of the secretary of the 

Intendencia. Coming from an almost desert country, we were struck with the bustle of the town, 

though it contained only six thousand inhabitants. We admired the conveniences which industry 

and commerce furnish to civilized man. Humble dwellings appeared to us magnificent; and every 

person with whom we conversed seemed to be endowed with superior intelligence. Long 



privations give a value to the smallest enjoyments; and I cannot express the pleasure we felt when 

we saw for the first time wheaten bread on the governor's table. Sensations of this sort are 

doubtless familiar to all who have made distant voyages.  A painful circumstance obliged us to 

sojourn a whole month in the town of Angostura. We felt ourselves on the first days after our 

arrival tired and enfeebled, but in perfect health. M. Bonpland began to examine the small number 

of plants which he had been able to save from the influence of the damp climate; and I was 

occupied in settling by astronomical observations the longitude and latitude of the capital,* as well 

as the dip of the magnetic needle. (* I found the latitude of Santo Tomas de la Nueva Guiana, 

commonly called Angostura, or the Strait, near the cathedral, 8 degrees 8 minutes 11 seconds, the 

longitude 66 degrees 15 minutes 21 seconds.) These labours were soon interrupted. We were 

both attacked almost on the same day by a disorder which with my fellow-traveller took the 

character of a debilitating fever. At this period the air was in a state of the greatest salubrity at 

Angostura; and as the only mulatto servant we had brought from Cumana felt symptoms of the 

same disorder, it was suspected that we had imbibed the germs of typhus in the damp forests of 

Cassiquiare. It is common enough for travellers to feel no effects from miasmata till, on arriving in 

a purer atmosphere, they begin to enjoy repose. A certain excitement of the mental powers may 

suspend for some time the action of pathogenic causes. Our mulatto servant having been much 

more exposed to the rains than we were, his disorder increased with frightful rapidity. His 

prostration of strength was excessive, and on the ninth day his death was 


_
Mead, the master of Washington Hall.  "Well, that was an exciting finish to the race," remarked 

Jack as he walked up from the float to the shore, surrounded by some of his chums, after Dock 

had been taken away.  "He oughtn't to try to row," said Fred Kaler. "He hasn't got the staying 

powers."  "Well, he didn't have to-day," observed Jack; "but if he would only train, he'd make a 

good oarsman. He's got lots of muscle. I hope he isn't hurt much."  "He'll be all right in a few days," 

was Nat's opinion. "Say, Jack, but you're shivering."  "Yes, that water's a little cooler however only 

in a state of swooning, which lasted several hours, and was followed by a salutary crisis. I was 

attacked at the same time with a violent fit of fever, during which I was made to take a mixture of 

honey and bark (the cortex Angosturae): a remedy much extolled in the country by the Capuchin 

missionaries. The intensity of the fever augmented but it left me on the following day. M. Bonpland 

remained in a very alarming state which during several weeks caused us the most serious 

inquietude. Fortunately he preserved sufficient self-possession to prescribe for 


_
"Here, put a couple of sweaters on," went on Nat, and soon Jack was warmly wrapped up.  "Now 

run up and change your duds," advised Bony, and Jack broke into a dog-trot, his friends trailing 

along behind him and discussing the race and the accident.  While they are thus engaged I will 

take the opportunity to tell you a little something about Jack Ranger and his friends, so that you 

who have not previously read of him may feel better acquainted with our hero.  The first volume of 

this series was called "Jack Ranger's Schooldays," and in it there was related some of the fun 

Jack and his special friend, Nat Anderson, had in their native town of Denton. So exciting were 

some of their escapades that it was decided to send them off to boarding-school, and Washington 

Hall, sometimes called remedies better adapted to his constitution. The fever was continual and, 

as almost always happens within the tropics, it was accompanied by dysentery. M. Bonpland 

displayed that courage and mildness of character which never forsook him in the most trying 

situations. I was agitated by sad presages for I remembered that the botanist Loefling, a pupil of 

Linnaeus, died not far from Angostura, near the banks of the Carony, a victim of his zeal for the 

progress of natural history. We had not yet passed a year in the torrid zone and my too faithful 

memory conjured up everything I had read in Europe on the dangers of the atmosphere inhaled in 

the forests. Instead of going up the Orinoco we might have sojourned some months in the 

temperate and salubrious climate of the Sierra Nevada de Merida. It 


_
from the fact that it was located on the shore of Lake Rudmore, was selected. There Jack made 

friends with most of the students, including some who have already been mentioned in this 

present tale. He incurred the enmity of a bully, Jerry Chowden, who, however, was not now at the 

academy, as you will presently learn.  Jack's home was with three maiden aunts, the Misses 

Angelina, Josephine and Mary Stebbins, who took good care of him. In the first volume there was 

related path of the rivers; and the danger of my fellow-traveller presented itself to my mind as the 

fatal consequence of this imprudent choice.  After having attained in a few days an extraordinary 

degree of exacerbation the fever assumed a less alarming character. The inflammation of the 

intestines yielded to the use of emollients obtained from malvaceous plants. The sidas and the 

melochias have singularly active properties in the torrid zone. The recovery of the patient however

Robert Ranger, and how he had to go into hiding in the West because of complications over a land 

deal.  In the second volume of the series, "Jack Ranger's Western Trip," was related what 

happened to Jack, Nat Anderson, and a half-breed Indian, John Smith, whose acquaintance Jack 

had made at Washington Hall, when they went West in search of Mr. Ranger.  They journeyed to a 

ranch, owned by Nat's uncle, and they had many exciting times, not a few of which were 

Europeans who are not thoroughly seasoned to the climate. The period of the rains drew near; 

and in order to return to the coast of Cumana, it was necessary again to cross the Llanos, where, 

amidst half-inundated lands, it is rare to find shelter, or any other food than meat dried in the sun. 

To avoid exposing M. Bonpland to a dangerous relapse, we resolved to stay at Angostura till the 

10th of July. We spent part of this time at a neighbouring plantation, where
