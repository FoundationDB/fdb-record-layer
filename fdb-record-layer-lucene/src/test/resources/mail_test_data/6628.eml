the sacred _Book of Enoch_ and the Taro (Rota) are before us. We quote from=
 the MS. copy of a=20

Western Occultist, which is prefaced by these words:       There is but one=
 Law, one Principle, one=20

Agent, one Truth and one     Word. That which is above is analogically as t=
hat which is below.=20

All that which is, is the result of quantities and of     equilibriums.   T=

this triple epigraph show the identity of thought between the East and the =
West with regard to the=20

Secret Science which, as the same MS. tells us, is:       The key of things=
 concealed, the key of the=20

sanctuary. This is the     Sacred Word which gives to the Adept the supreme=
 reason of=20

Occultism and its Mysteries. It is the Quintessence of     Philosophies and=
 of Dogmas; it is the=20

Alpha and Omega; it is the     Light, Life and Wisdom Universal.   The Taro=
 of the sacred _Book of=20

Enoch_, or Rota, is prefaced, moreover, with this explanation:       The an=
tiquity of this Book is lost=20

in the night of time. It is of     _Indian origin_, and goes back to an epo=
ch long before Moses....     It=20

is written upon detached leaves, which at the first were of     fine gold a=
nd precious metals.... It is=20

symbolical, and its     combinations adapt themselves to all the wonders of=
 the Spirit.     Altered by=20

its passage across the Ages, it is nevertheless     preserved--thanks to th=
e ignorance of the=20

curious--in its types and     its most important primitive figures.   This =
is the Rota of Enoch, now=20

" and which are=20
