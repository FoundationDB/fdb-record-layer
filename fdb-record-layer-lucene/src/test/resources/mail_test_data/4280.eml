From Washington and Wythe in 1832 was established the new county of Smyth s=
ituated in the=20

southwestern section of Virginia and extending to the North Carolina line. =
The name derives from=20

General Alexander Smyth of Wythe County, Inspector General of the Army in 1=

Congress 1817-1825, 1827-1830. A portrait of him by Saint Memin is in the C=
orcoran Art Gallery.=20

The bounds of the county are set forth as follows: "Beginning on the main s=
tage road at a bridge in=20

sses the same; thence=20
