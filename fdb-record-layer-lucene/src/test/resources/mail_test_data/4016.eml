 The Indians even went out in canoes to attack the vessel but were repulsed=
, and the Spaniards, setting sail, put to sea.  The defenceless friars rema=
ined, however, and at Chiribichi the priest, while vesting to say mass, and=
 the _
overcome, Las Casas was at last ready to launch his colonial venture. Frien=
ds in Seville advanced=20

him loans of money and others presented him with a quantity of article of t=
rade, of small enough=20

value in Spain but of great worth in the eyes of the Indians.  The fifty me=
n who were to adopt the=20

white habit of the Knight of the Golden Spur had not been selected, but it =
was thought well to=20

begin the settlement with labourers and perhaps to head solemnly, saying =
=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t know what to do=20

with you Caroline; I am ashamed of you!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut I=E2=80=99m =
truly sorry Aunt Charlotte.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf you are I don=E2=80=99t=
=20

see why you laugh. Now I believe Marjorie is sorry,=E2=80=9D and Miss Barro=
ws looked with approval at that=20

tearful maiden.  As if this were not disgrace enough for one household, Tro=
lley after he had=20

recovered from the feathers made his way into the kitchen and stole one of =
the birds the cook was=20


_
already settled in the Indies.  He sailed with his little company from San =
Lucar de Barrameda on=20

November 11, 1520, and after an uneventful voyage reached the island of Pue=
rto Rico, called by=20

the Indians Boriquen, and first named San Juan by the Spaniards.  While Las=
 Casas had been=20

sustaining his long struggle in Spain in behalf of the Indians, a series of=
 disastrous events had=20

occurred in America, which created serious obstacles in the way of his sche=
me for colonisation. In=20

1518 some Dominican and Franciscan friars had founded two convents on the P=
earl Coast, the=20

former at Chiribichi and the latter at Maracapana, some seven leagues dista=
nt at the mouth of the=20

Cumana River and just opposite the island of Cubagua.  These religious comm=
unities had=20

established the most peaceful relations with all the Indians in their neigh=
bourhood and the friars=20

came and went with perfect freedom, being welcomed in all the villages.  Al=
l went quietly until the=20

arrival of one Alonzo de Ojeda, who came from Cubagua, engaged ostensibly i=
n the pearl trade,=20

but likewise in raiding for slaves. Pearl diving was as perilous and fatal =
an occupation for the=20

Indians as the work in the mines of Hispaniola and Cuba, and such numbers h=
ad perished in=20

Cubagua that it was necessary to replenish the vacancies by bringing others=
 from the=20

neighbouring mainland.  When Ojeda landed at Chiribichi he repaired to the =
convent, where he=20

found but one priest and a lay-brother, all the others being absent, preach=
ing to the Spaniards in=20

Cubagua.  As he expressed a wish to see the cacique, Maraguey, the priest, =
thinking no evil, sent=20

to invite the Indian to come to the monastery;  Caro found him at dusk sitt=
ing in solemn majesty=20

before the hall fire, quite as if nothing had happened.  =E2=80=9CTrolley,=
=E2=80=9D she said, getting down beside him=20

on the rug, =E2=80=9Cdo you know you have been naughty too?=E2=80=9D  He ru=
bbed his head against her hand in a=20

manner that said as plainly as words, =E2=80=9CPet me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CD=
id you get a spanking, Trolley? I don=E2=80=99t know=20

what Aunt Charlotte is going to do to me. You are so nice and soft; you are=
 a great comfort.=E2=80=9D As=20

Caro made a pillow of him Trolley broke into a loud purr.  =E2=80=9CI am so=
rry I was naughty--I just didn=E2=80=99t=20

think a bit. It was such fun to see the feathers fly. I wanted to be good w=
hile grandpa was away,=20

and now I=E2=80=99ve spoiled it. Oh dear, I wish mamma would come and take =
me home, I am so=20

lonesome!=E2=80=9D  Trolley didn=E2=80=99t understand how anyone could be u=
nhappy before such a pleasant fire,=20

with him for company, and he continued to purr loudly while Caro=E2=80=99s =
tears fell fast. His view of=20

things prevailed after a while, and when Aunt Charlotte came down stairs sh=
e found the two curled=20

up together on the rug, fast asleep.  The tear stains on Caro=E2=80=99s che=
ek softened her. Perhaps the=20

child really felt more than she showed, and she decided she would not take =
away her candle that=20

night as a punishment, as she had thought of doing. More than this she let =
her have peach=20

preserves for supper.  The preserves went to Caro=E2=80=99s heart and made =
her more penitent than ever.=20

=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m truly going to be good after this, and I=E2=80=99ll he=
lp Jane pick up the feathers,=E2=80=9D she said as she=20

kissed her aunt good-night.     CHAPTER VII  IN THE GARDEN   Everybody agre=
ed that the=20

weather was remarkable that fall; far into November it lasted warm and brig=
ht, and=20


_
question him as to whether cannibalism was practised by any tribes in the n=
eighbourhood, his=20

answers being taken down on paper by a notary.  The cacique declared that t=
here were no=20

cannibals thereabouts and, being displeased by the questions and alarmed by=
 the formalities of=20

ink and paper, he quickly withdrew.  Ojeda next went to the convent at Mara=
capana, where the=20

cacique, called Gil Gonzalez, came to meet him with every demonstration of =
friendship.  Ojeda=20

declared he had come to trade and wished to buy maize, and on the day follo=
wing his arrival he=20

left with fifteen of his men to go inland in search of the grain.  Fifty In=
dians transported the loads=20

from the interior to the coast, and while these bearers were resting, the S=
paniards suddenly drew=20

their weapons, killing some who tried to escape and forcing all the others =
on board their caravel.=20

The effect of this act of unprovoked treachery in a peaceful settlement, wh=
ere the Indians had=20

received the newcomers with every hospitality as guests, may be easily imag=
ined, and as was=20

natural, Gil Gonzalez planned vengeance for the outrage.  The scene at the =
convent whither the=20

cacique of Chiribichi had been summoned by his friend the priest, and the i=
mpressive formality of=20

the writing with pen and paper furnished by the priest, unfortunately ident=
ified the monks in the=20

minds of the Indians with Ojeda more endurable under the open sky than with=
in four walls, spent a=20

large part of each day out of doors attended by his faithful Thompson.  Car=
o=E2=80=99s visit had stirred=20

anew his longing for the old companionships that had once been his. When at=
 length after their=20

long absence they had decided to come home, he had looked forward to it alm=
ost eagerly, but his=20

sister whose pride shrank from sympathy took it for granted that to meet hi=
s old acquaintances=20

could be only painful to him, and those who had ventured to call were not a=
dmitted.  Walter was in=20

the habit of acquiescing in her decisions, and in the first shock of his il=
lness he had felt the same=20

shrinking from pity, but now the sense of loneliness was becoming almost un=
bearable. As he was=20

wheeled about the garden he lived over again the merry days of his childhoo=
d, and the quarrel that=20

had separated him from those he had cared most for, seemed a small matter i=
n the light of these=20

memories.  The Graysons had long been people of wealth and influence in Cha=
rmington, and in=20

Miss Elizabeth=E2=80=99s opinion it was a direct insult when her wishes wer=
e ignored and the beauty of the=20

avenue which had been named for her grandfather was, as she thought, foreve=
r ruined. That her=20

personal friends could side against her, added to the bitterness. She refus=
ed to see that Dr.=20

Barrows was not responsible for his brother=E2=80=99s=20


_
along the coast, and the Indians bided the moment for a favourable attack; =
nor had they long to=20

wait, for Ojeda, accompanied by ten men, came on shore again on Saturday as=
 indifferently as=20

though nothing had happened. Gil Gonzalez affected to receive them in a fri=
endly manner, but no=20

sooner had they reached the village than the Indians fell upon them, killin=
g Ojeda and several=20

others, while the remainder whole family, and her gifts from the seminary. =
 No doubt her grief over=20

her brother made her more bitter than she would otherwise have been; at lea=
st so Dr. Barrows=20

thought, and would not speak ill of her.  Walter upon whom she lavished eve=
rything affection could=20

suggest, or money buy, felt that he could not ask for the only thing he rea=
lly wanted. And at times=20

he told himself despondently that he was=20
