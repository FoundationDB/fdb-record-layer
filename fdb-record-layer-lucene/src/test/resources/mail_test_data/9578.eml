dracaena marginata out of the seven degrees of Initiation.  After a prelimi=
nary trial at Thebes, where the neophyte had to pass through many probation=
s, called the "Twelve Tortures," he was commanded, in order that he might c=
ome out triumphant, to govern his passions and never lose for a moment the =
idea of his inner God or seventh Principle. Then, as a symbol of the wander=
ings of the unpurified the steward of the Duc de Grammont, to give him a su=
bstitute; he also spoke of it to Monsieur de Chavigny, who promised that he=
 would not oppose it in any way--that is, if he approved of the person prop=
osed.  We consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of Grima=
ud; if, as we hope, our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of=
 this work, they must have dracaena marginata out of the seven degrees of I=
nitiation.  After a preliminary trial at Thebes, where the neophyte had to =
pass through many probations, called the "Twelve Tortures," he was commande=
d, in order that he might come out triumphant, to govern his passions and n=
ever lose for a moment the idea of his inner God or seventh Principle. Then=
, as a symbol of the wanderings of the unpurified the steward of the Duc de=
 Grammont, to give him a substitute; he also spoke of it to Monsieur de Cha=
vigny, who promised that he would not oppose it in any way--that is, if he =
approved of the person proposed.  We consider it useless to draw a physical=
 or moral portrait of Grimaud; if, as we hope, our readers have not wholly =
forgotten the first part of this work, they must have _
_before_ Christianity," as he expresses it. Thus he shows us Krishna and Ap=
ollo as good=20

shepherds, Krishna holding the cruciform Conch and the Chakra, and Krishna =
"crucified in Space,"=20

as he calls it. Of this figure it may be truly said, as the author says of =
it himself:       This=20

representation I believe to be anterior to Christianity....     It looks li=
ke a Christian crucifix in many=20

respects.... The     drawing, the attitude, the nail-marks in hands and fee=
t, indicate     a Christian=20

origin, while the Parthian coronet of seven points,     the absence of the =
wood, and of the usual=20

inscription, and the     rays of glory above, would seem to point to some o=
ther than a     Christian=20

origin. Can it be the victim-man, or the priest and     victim both in one,=
 of the Hindu Mythology,=20

who offered himself a     sacrifice before the worlds were?   It is surely =
so.       Can it be Plato's=20

Second God who impressed himself on the universe     in the form of the cro=
ss? Or is it his divine=20

man, who would be     scourged, tormented, fettered, have his eyes burnt ou=
t; and lastly     ...=20

_would be crucified_?   It is all that and much more; archaic religious Phi=
losophy was universal,=20

and its Mysteries are as old as man. It is the eternal symbol of the person=
ified Sun--astronomically=20

purified--in its mystic meaning regenerated, and symbolised by all the Init=
iates in memory of a=20

sinless Humanity when all were "Sons of God." Now, mankind has become the "=
Son of Evil" truly.=20

Does all this take anything away from the dignity of Christ as an ideal, or=
 of Jesus as a divine=20

man? Not at all. On the contrary, made to stand alone, glorified above all =
other "Sons of God," He=20

can only foment evil feelings in all those many millioned nations who do no=
t going to plant a bed of=20

asparagus for his especial use. Now, since, as every one knows, asparagus t=
akes four years in=20

coming to perfection, this civility infuriated Monsieur de Beaufort.  At la=
st his patience was=20

exhausted. He assembled his keepers, and notwithstanding his well-known dif=
ficulty of utterance,=20

addressed them as follows:  "Gentlemen! will you permit a grandson of Henry=
 IV. to be=20

overwhelmed with insults and ignominy?  "Odds fish! as my grandfather used =
to say, I once=20

reigned in Paris! do you know that? I had the king and Monsieur the whole o=
f one day in my care.=20

The queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the ki=
ngdom. Gentlemen=20

and citizens, set me free; I shall go to the Louvre and strangle Mazarin. Y=
ou shall be my body-

guard. I will make you all captains, with good pensions! Odds fish! On! mar=
ch forward!"  But=20

eloquent as he might be, the eloquence of the grandson of Henry IV. did not=
 touch those hearts of=20

stone; not one man stirred, so Monsieur de Beaufort was obliged to be satis=
fied with calling them=20

all kinds of rascals underneath the sun.  Sometimes, when Monsieur de Chavi=
gny paid him a visit,=20

the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of Parisian=
s, all fully armed,=20

appear at Vincennes to deliver him from prison.  "My lord," answered De Cha=
vigny, with a low=20

bow, "I have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates=
 thirty thousand guns. I=20

should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded." =
 "Yes, but after you=20

had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon; the don=
jon being taken, I=20

should be obliged to let them hang you--at which I should be most unhappy, =
certainly."  And in his=20

turn the duke bowed=20


_
Christian system, provoking their hatred and leading to iniquitous wars and=
 strifes. If, on the other=20

hand, we place Him among a long series of "Sons of God" and Sons of divine =
Light, every man=20

may then be left to choose for himself, among those many ideals, which he w=
ill choose as a God=20

to call to his help, and worship on earth as in Heaven.  Many among those c=
alled "Saviours" were=20

"good shepherds," as was Krishna for one, and all of them are said to have =
"crushed the serpent's=20

head"--in other words to have conquered their sensual nature and to have ma=
stered divine and=20

Occult Wisdom. Apollo killed Python, a fact which exonerates him from the c=
harge of being himself=20

the great Dragon, Satan: Krishna slew the snake Kalinaga, the Black Serpent=
; and the=20

Scandinavian Thor bruised the head of the symbolical reptile with his  "For=
 myself, on the other=20

hand, my lord," returned the governor, "when the first rebel should pass th=
e threshold of my=20

postern doors I should be obliged to kill you with my own hand, since you w=
ere confided peculiarly=20

to my care and as I am obliged to give you up, dead or alive."  And once mo=
re he bowed low=20

before his highness.  These bitter-sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes, s=
ometimes longer, but=20

always finished thus:  Monsieur de Chavigny, turning toward the door, used =
to call out: "Halloo! La=20

Ramee!"  La Ramee came into the room.  "La Ramee, I recommend Monsieur le D=
uc to you,=20

particularly; treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated=
; that is, never leave him=20

alone an instant."  La Ramee became, therefore, the duke's dinner guest by =
compulsion--an=20

eternal keeper, the shadow of his person; but La=20

In Egypt every city of importance was separated from its burial-place by a =
sacred lake. The same=20

ceremony of judgment, as is described in _The Book of the Dead_--"that prec=
ious and mysterious=20

book" (Bunsen)--as taking place in the world of Spirit, took place on earth=
 during the burial of the=20

mummy. Forty-two judges or assessors assembled on the shore and judged the =
departed "Soul"=20

according to its actions when in the body. After that convivial, fond of pl=
ay, a great hand at tennis,=20

had one defect in the duke's eyes--his incorruptibility.  Now, although La =
Ramee appreciated, as of=20

a certain value, the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great imp=
ortance, still the pleasure=20

of living in intimacy with the grandson of Henry IV. hardly compensated for=
 the loss of that which=20

he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family.  One may=
 be a jailer=20


_
priests returned within the sacred precincts and instructed the neophytes u=
pon the probable fate of=20

the Soul, and the solemn drama that was then taking place in the invisible =
realm whither the Soul=20

had fled. The immortality of the Spirit was strongly inculcated on the neop=
hytes by the _Al-om-

jah_--the name of the highest Egyptian Hierophant. In the Crata Nepoa--the =
priestly Mysteries in=20

Egypt--the following husband. La Ramee adored his wife and children, whom n=
ow he could only=20

catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall, when in order to please him th=
ey used to walk on the=20

opposite side of the moat. 'Twas too brief an enjoyment, and La Ramee felt =
that the gayety of=20

heart he had regarded as the cause of health (of which it was perhaps rathe=
r the result) would not=20

long survive such a mode of life.  He accepted,=20
