Fire.   Fire is not an Element but a divine thing. The physical flame is th=
e objective vehicle of the=20

highest Spirit. The Fire Elementals are the highest. Everything in this wor=
ld has its Aura and its=20

Spirit. The flame you apply to the candle has nothing to do with the candle=
 itself. The Aura of the=20

object comes into conjunction with the lowest part of the other. Granite ca=
nnot burn because its=20

Aura is Fire. Fire Elementals have no consciousness on this plane, they are=
 too high, reflecting the=20

divinity of their own source. Other Elementals have consciousness on this p=
lane as they reflect=20

man and his nature. There is a very great difference between the mineral an=
d vegetable=20

kingdoms. The wick of the lamp, for instance, is negative. It is made posit=
ive by fire, the oil being=20

the medium. AEther is Fire. The lowest part of AEther is the flame which yo=
u see. Fire is Divinity in=20

its subjective presence throughout the universe. Under other conditions, th=
is Universal Fire=20

manifests as water, air and earth. It is the one Element in our visible Uni=
verse which is the=20

Kriyashakti of all forms of life. It is that which gives light, heat, death=
, life, etc. It is even the blood.=20

In all its various manifestations it is essentially _one_.  It is the "seve=
n Cosmocratores."  Evidence=20

of the esteem in which Fire was held are to be found in the _Old Testament_=
. The Pillar of Fire,=20

the Burning Bush, the Shining Face of Moses--all Fire. Fire is like a looki=
ng-glass in its nature, and=20

reflects the beams of the first order of subjective manifestations which ar=
e supposed to be thrown=20

on to the screen of the first outlines of the created universe; in their lo=
wer aspect these are the=20

creations of Fire.  Fire in the grossest aspect of its essence is the first=
 form and reflects the lower=20

forms of the first subjective beings which are in the universe. The first d=
ivine chaotic thoughts are=20

the Fire Elementals. When on earth they take form and come flitting in the =
flame in the form of the=20

Salamanders or lower Fire Elementals. In the air you have millions of livin=
g and conscious beings,=20

besides our thoughts which they catch up. The Fire Elementals are related t=
o the sense of sight=20

and absorb the Elementals of all the other senses. Thus through sight you c=
an have the=20

consciousness of feeling, hearing, tasting, etc., since all are included in=
 the sense of sight.    Hints=20

On The Future.   As time passes on there will be more and more ether in the=
 air. When ether fills=20

the air, then will be born children without fathers. In Virginia there is a=
n apple tree of a special kind.=20

It does not blossom but bears fruit from a kind of berry without any seeds.=
 This will gradually=20

extend to animals and then to men. Women will bear children without impregn=
ation, and in the=20

Seventh Round there will appear men who can reproduce themselves. In the Se=
venth Race of the=20

Fourth Round, men will change their skins every year and will have new toe =
and finger nails.=20

People will become more psychic, then spiritual. Last of all in the Seventh=
 Round, Buddhas will be=20

born without sin. The Fourth Round is the longest in the Kali Yuga, then th=
e Fifth, then the Sixth,=20

and the Seventh Round will be very short.    The Egos.   On the separation =
of the Principles at=20

death the Higher Ego may be said to go to Devachan by reason of the experie=
nces of the Lower.=20

The Higher Ego in its own plane is the Kumara.  The Lower Quaternary dissol=
ves; the body rots,=20

the Linga Sharira fades out.  At reincarnation the Higher Ego shoots out a =
Ray, the Lower Ego. Its=20

energies are upward and downward. The upward tendencies become its Devachan=
ic experiences;=20

the lower are Kamic. The Higher Manas stands to Buddhi as the Lower Manas t=
o the Higher.  As=20

to the question of responsibility, it may be understood by an example. If y=
ou take the form of Jack=20

the Vendomois road, D'Artagnan, you so brave, and you, Porthos, so valiant =
and so strong--you=20

were beaten; to-day Aramis and I are beaten in our turn. Now that never hap=
pened to us when we=20

were four together. Let us die, then, as De Winter has died; as for me, I w=
ill fly only on condition=20



that we all fly together."  "Impossible," said D'Artagnan; "we are under Ma=
zarin's orders."  "I know=20

it and I have nothing more to say; my arguments lead to nothing; doubtless =
they are bad, since=20

they have not determined minds so just as yours."  "Besides," said Aramis, =
"had they taken effect=20

it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like D'Art=
agnan and Porthos. Be=20

assured, gentlemen, we shall do you honor in our dying. As for myself, I sh=
all be proud to face the=20

bullets, or even the rope, in company with you, Athos; for you have never s=
eemed to me so grand=20

as you are to-day."  D'Artagnan said nothing, but, after having gnawed the =
flower stalk, he began=20

to bite his nails. At last:  "Do you imagine," he resumed, "that they mean =
to kill you? And=20

wherefore should they do so? What interest have they in your death? Moreove=
r, you are our=20

prisoners."  "Fool!" cried Aramis; "knowest thou not, then, Mordaunt? I hav=
e but exchanged with=20

him one look, yet that look convinced me that we were doomed."  "The truth =
is, I'm very sorry that I=20

did not strangle him as you advised me," said Porthos.  "Eh! I make no acco=
unt of the harm=20

Mordaunt can do!" cried D'Artagnan. "Cap de Diou! if he troubles me too muc=
h I will crush him, the=20

insect! Do not fly, then. It is useless; for I swear to you that you are as=
 safe here as you were=20

twenty years, ago--you, Athos, in the Rue Ferou, and you, Aramis, in the Ru=
e de Vaugirard."=20

"Stop," cried Athos, extending his hand to one of the grated windows by whi=
ch the room was=20

lighted; "you will soon know what to expect, for here he is."  "Who?"  "Mor=
daunt."  In fact, looking=20

at the place to which Athos pointed, D'Artagnan saw a cavalier coming towar=
d the house at full=20

gallop.  It was Mordaunt.  D'Artagnan rushed out of the room.  Porthos want=
ed to follow him.=20

"Stay," said D'Artagnan, "and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers =
on the door."  When=20

Mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw D'Artagnan on the threshold and =
the soldiers lying on=20

the grass here and there, with their arms.  "Halloo!" he cried, "are the pr=
isoners still there?"  "Yes,=20

sir," answered the sergeant, uncovering.  "'Tis well; order four men to con=
duct them to my=20

lodging."  Four men prepared to do so.  "What is it?" said D'Artagnan, with=
 that jeering manner=20

which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquain=
tance. "What is the=20

matter, if you please?"  "Sir," replied Mordaunt, "I have ordered the two p=
risoners we made this=20

morning to be conducted to my lodging."  "Wherefore, sir? Excuse curiosity,=
 but I wish to be=20

enlightened on the subject."  "Because these prisoners, sir, are at my disp=
osal and I choose to=20

dispose of them as I like."  "Allow me--allow me, sir," said D'Artagnan, "t=
o observe you are in error.=20

The prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw t=
hem taken. You=20

might have taken Lord Winter--who, 'tis said, was your uncle--prisoner, but=
 you preferred killing=20

him; 'tis well; we, that is, Monsieur du Vallon and I, could have killed ou=
r prisoners--we preferred=20

taking them."  Mordaunt's very lips grew white with rage.  D'Artagnan now s=
aw that affairs were=20

growing worse and he beat the guard's march upon the door. At the first bea=
t Porthos rushed out=20

and stood on the other side of the door.  This movement was observed by Mor=
daunt.  "Sir!" he=20

thus addressed D'Artagnan, "your resistance is useless; these prisoners hav=
e just been given me=20

by my illustrious patron, Oliver Cromwell."  These words struck D'Artagnan =
like a=20


_
for the law will punish the murderer and hold him responsible. You are the =
sacrificial victim. In the=20

same way the Higher Ego is the Christos, the sacrificial victim for the Low=
er Manas. The Ego=20

takes the responsibility of every body it informs.  You borrow some money t=
o lend it to another; the=20

other runs away, but it is you who are responsible. The mission of the High=
er Ego is to shoot out a=20

Ray to be a Soul in a child.  Thus the Ego incarnates in a thousand bodies,=
 taking upon itself the=20

sins and responsibilities of each body. At every incarnation a new Ray is e=
mitted, and yet it is the=20

same Ray in essence, the same in you and me and every one. The dross of the=
 incarnation=20

disintegrates, the good goes to Devachan.  The Flame is eternal. From the F=
lame of the Higher=20

Ego, the Lower is lighted, and from this a lower vehicle, and so on.  And y=
et the Lower Manas is=20

such as it makes itself. It is possible for it to act differently in like c=
onditions, for it has reason and=20

self- conscious knowledge of right and wrong, and good and evil, given to i=
t. It is in fact endowed=20

with all the attributes of the Divine Soul. In this the Ray is the Higher M=
anas, the speck of=20

responsibility on earth.  The part of the essence is the essence, but while=
 it is out of itself, so to=20

say, it can get soiled and polluted. The Ray can be manifested on this eart=
h because it can send=20

forth its Mayavi Rupa. But the Higher cannot, so it has to send forth a Ray=
. We may look upon the=20

Higher Ego as the Sun, and the personal Manases as its Rays. If we take awa=
y the surrounding=20

air and light the Ray may be said to return to the Sun, so with the Lower M=
anas and Lower=20

Quaternary.  The Higher Ego can only manifest through its attributes.  In c=
ases of sudden death,=20

the Lower Manas no more disappears than does the Kama Rupa after death. Aft=
er the severance=20

the Ray may be said to snap or be dropped. After death such a man cannot go=
 to Devachan, nor=20

yet remain in Kama Loka; his fate is to reincarnate immediately. Such an en=
tity is then an animal=20

Soul _plus_ the intelligence of the severed Ray. The manifestation of this =
intelligence in the next=20

birth will depend entirely on the physical formation of the brain and on ed=
ucation.  Such a Soul=20

may be re-united with its Higher Ego in the next birth, if the environment =
is such as to give it a=20

chance of aspiration (this is the "grace" of the his temples, his eyes beca=
me dim; he saw from=20

what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose, and he put hi=
s hand to the hilt of=20

his sword.  As for Porthos, he looked inquiringly at D'Artagnan.  This look=
 of Porthos's made the=20

Gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him=
 in an affair which=20

seemed to require chiefly cunning.  "Violence," he said to himself, "would =
spoil all; D'Artagnan, my=20

friend, prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger, but mo=
re subtle than he is."=20

"Ah!" he said, making a low bow, "why did you not begin by saying that, Mon=
sieur Mordaunt?=20

What! are you sent by General Oliver Cromwell, the most illustrious captain=
 of the age?"  "I have=20

this instant left him," replied Mordaunt, alighting, in order to give his h=
orse to a soldier to hold.=20

"Why did you not say so at once, my dear sir! all England is with Cromwell;=
 and since you ask for=20

my prisoners, I bend, sir, to your wishes. They are yours; take them."  Mor=
daunt, delighted,=20

advanced, Porthos looking at D'Artagnan with open-mouthed astonishment. The=
n D'Artagnan trod=20

on his foot and Porthos began to understand that this was merely acting.  M=
ordaunt put his foot on=20

the first step of the door and, with his hat in hand, prepared to pass by t=
he two friends, motioning=20

to the four men to follow him.  "But, pardon," said D'Artagnan, with the mo=
st charming smile and=20

putting his hand on the young man's shoulder, "if the illustrious General O=
liver Cromwell has=20

disposed of our prisoners in your favour, he has, of course, made that act =
of donation in writing."=20

Mordaunt stopped short.  "He has given you some little writing for me--the =
least bit of paper which=20



may show that you come in his name. Be pleased to give me that scrap of pap=
er so that I may=20

justify, by a pretext at least, my abandoning my countrymen. Otherwise, you=
 see, although I am=20

sure that General Oliver Cromwell can intend them no harm, it would have a =
bad appearance."=20

Mordaunt recoiled; he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at D'Art=
agnan, who responded=20

by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human countenance.  "When=
 I tell you a thing,=20

sir," said Mordaunt, "you insult me by doubting it."  "I!" cried D'Artagnan=
, "I doubt what you say!=20

God keep me from it, my dear Monsieur Mordaunt! On the contrary, I take you=
 to be a worthy and=20

accomplished=20


_
the Ray becoming weaker and weaker, and gradually dissipating, until it is =
born a congenital idiot=20

and then finally dissipated in lower forms.  There are enormous mysteries c=
onnected with the=20

Lower Manas.  With regard to some intellectual giants, they are in somewhat=
 the same condition=20

as smaller men, for their Higher Ego is paralyzed, that is to say, their sp=
iritual nature is atrophied.=20

The Manas can pass its essence to several vehicles, _e.g._, the Mayavi Rupa=
, etc., and even to=20

Elementals which it can ensoul, as the Rosicrucians taught.  The Mayavi Rup=
a may be sometimes=20

so vitalized that it goes on to another plane and unites with the beings of=
 that plane and so=20

ensouls them.  People who bestow great affection upon animal pets are ensou=
ling them to a=20

certain extent, and such animal Souls progress very rapidly; in return such=
 persons get back the=20

animal vitality and magnetism. It is, however, against Nature to thus accen=
tuate animal evolution,=20

and on the whole is bad.    Monadic Evolution.   The Kumaras do not direct =
the evolution of the=20

Lunar Pitris. To understand the latter, we might take the analogy of the bl=
ood.  The blood may be=20

compared to the universal Life Principle, the corpuscles to the Monads. The=
 different kinds of=20

corpuscles are the same as the various classes of Monads and various kingdo=
ms, not, however,=20

because of their essence being different, but because of the environment in=
 which they are. The=20

Chhaya you?" continued D'Artagnan, with his frank expression.  "Speak out, =
sir," said Mordaunt.=20

"Monsieur du Vallon, yonder, is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly, =
so he does not care=20

about money. I do not speak for him, but for myself."  "Well, sir? What mor=
e?"  "Well--I--I'm not=20

rich. In Gascony 'tis no dishonor, sir, nobody is rich; and Henry IV., of g=
lorious memory, who was=20

the king of the Gascons, as His Majesty Philip IV. is the king of the Spani=
ards, never had a penny=20

in his pocket."  "Go on, sir, I see what you wish to get at; and if it is s=
imply what I think that stops=20

you, I can obviate the difficulty."  "Ah, I knew well," said the Gascon, "t=
hat you were a man of=20

talent. Well, here's the case, here's where the saddle hurts me, as we Fren=
ch say. I am an officer=20

of fortune, nothing else; I have nothing but what my sword brings me in--th=
at is to say, more blows=20

than banknotes. Now, on taking prisoners, this morning, two Frenchmen, who =
seemed to me of=20

high birth--in short, two knights of the Garter--I said to myself, my fortu=
ne is made. I say two,=20

because in such circumstances, Monsieur du Vallon, who is rich, always give=
s me his prisoners."=20

Mordaunt, completely deceived by the wordy civility of D'Artagnan, smiled l=
ike a man who=20

understands perfectly the reasons given him, and said:  "I shall have the o=
rder signed directly, sir,=20

and with it two thousand pistoles; meanwhile, let me take these men away." =
 "No,"=20


_
hereditary germ theory is very near truth.  H. P. B. was asked whether ther=
e was one Ego to one=20

permanent Chhaya seed, oversouling it in a series of incarnations; her answ=
er was: "No, it is=20

Heaven and Earth kissing each other."  The animal Souls are in temporary fo=
rms and shells in=20

which they gain experience, a man of order, sir; let us do things in order.=
"  "Nevertheless," replied=20

Mordaunt, "I could compel you; I command here."  "Ah, sir!" said D'Artagnan=
, "I see that although=20

we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us. We a=
re gentlemen; we=20

are, both of us, able to kill you and your=20


_
Until the age of seven the astral atavic germ forms and moulds the body; af=
ter that the body forms=20

the Astral.  The Astral and the Mind mutually react on each other.  The mea=
ning of the passage in=20

the _Upanishads_, where it says that the Gods feed on men, is that the High=
er Ego obtains its=20

earth experience through the Lower.    Astral Body.   The Astral can get ou=
t unconsciously to the=20

person and wander about.  The Chhaya is the same as the Astral Body.  The g=
erm or life essence=20

of it is in the spleen.  "The Chhaya is coiled up in the spleen." It is fro=
m this that the Astral is=20

formed; it evolves in a shadowy curling or gyrating essence like smoke, gra=
dually taking form as it=20

grows. But it is not projected from the physical, atom for atom. This latte=
r intermolecular form is the=20

Kama Rupa. At death every cell and molecule gives out its essence, and from=
 it is formed the=20

Astral of the Kama Rupa; but this can never come out during life.  The Chha=
ya in order to become=20

visible draws upon the surrounding atmosphere, attracting the atoms to itse=
lf; the Linga Sharira=20

could not form _in vacuo_. The fact of the Heaven's sake don't be obstinate=
, for when others are=20

obstinate I am obstinate likewise, and then I become ferocious and headstro=
ng, and there's my=20

friend, who is even more headstrong and ferocious than myself. Besides, we =
are sent here by=20

Cardinal Mazarin, and at this moment represent both the king and the cardin=
al, and are, therefore,=20

as ambassadors, able to act with impunity, a thing that General Oliver Crom=
well, who is assuredly=20

as great a politician as he is a general, is quite the man to understand. A=
sk him then, for the=20

written order. What will that cost you my dear Monsieur Mordaunt?"  "Yes, t=
he written order," said=20

Porthos, who now began to comprehend what D'Artagnan was aiming at, "we ask=
 only for that."=20

However inclined Mordaunt was to have recourse to violence, he understood t=
he reasons=20

D'Artagnan had given him; besides, completely ignorant of the friendship wh=
ich existed between=20

the four Frenchmen, all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the pla=
usible motive of the=20

ransom. He decided, therefore, not only to fetch the order, but the two tho=
usand pistoles, at which=20

he estimated the=20
