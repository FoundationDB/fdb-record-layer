"infant industries" should be protected; and Bernaldez proposes a new sched=
ule, carefully=20

classified. The inter-island trade is exclusively in the hands of the alcal=
des-mayor and the rich=20

Chinese and mestizos, who should therefore pay a moderate tax on that lucra=
tive commerce. A=20

colonial currency is urgently needed. An account of the management of the o=
bras pas should be=20

demanded by the government, and those funds should be employed in promoting=
 agriculture and=20

industry in the islands. The shipbuilding and mining carried on by the gove=
rnment ought to be=20

furnished by private persons under contract. Agriculture is the most import=
ant industry of Filipinas,=20

and a feeder to its commerce; its backward condition should be remedied. He=
 recommends direct=20

and unlimited commerce between Spain and the islands, government encouragem=
ent to large=20

agricultural enterprises, instruction of the Indians in better methods of a=
griculture and the=20

preparation of its products, and rewards for industry and application on th=
eir part. The production=20

of opium for the Chinese market ought to be allowed in Filipinas, and heavy=
 duties collected on its=20

exportation. Enormous sums of money are yearly carried to India and China f=
or fine cotton goods,=20

which could as well be manufactured by the Filipinos if they knew how to dy=
e these properly and=20

had machinery for spinning the cotton thread; the government should take ac=
tive and prompt=20

measures to secure this desirable end. Closer relations should be establish=
ed with Spain, whose=20

government and merchants are urged to work together in behalf of this. Bern=
aldez concludes by=20

showing "the necessity of forming a special code of laws for Filipinas," an=
d of "a periodical=20

visitation of that colony by officials from the Peninsula." As appendix to =
his memorial, we present a=20

summary of a similar document, written at nearly the same time by a merchan=
t of long and varied=20

commercial experience in the Orient and the Americas. Less official and for=
mal, but more shrewd,=20

alert, and liberal, this writer presents his views, with much clearness and=
 force, on the decadence=20

of the islands and the means of making them more prosperous and wealthy; an=
d a comparison of=20

these with the opinions of Bernaldez might well be helpful to the present a=
dministration of=20

Filipinas.  In an appendix to this volume we present a brief account of the=
 three Spanish Cortes in=20

which the Philippines had representation; all these sessions occurred in th=
e early part of the=20

nineteenth century, one of the most disturbed and critical periods of Spain=
's national existence.=20

The most important measures of these Cortes concerning the Philippines were=
, the suppression of=20

the Acapulco-Manila galleon and the abolition of the privileges formerly Sa=
turday, June 1st, the=20

committee had opened another. Telephonic communication was broken, but a bo=
y was sent on=20

horseback to Shoyestown with a message to Pittsburg for hospital equipments=
--cots, mattrasses,=20

pillows, medicines and other necessities; and such was the energy of all co=
ncerned that by two=20

o=E2=80=99clock on Sunday, less than twenty-four hours from the sending of =
the message, the equipment=20

was in Johnstown. At that time every bench and counter and even the floor w=
as crowded with the=20

sick and wounded from all parts of the city.  It is impossible to describe =
the varied movements of=20

that dreadful day. There was little shelter and less food, death everywhere=
, and some doubtless=20

imprisoned in heaps of wreck, and not yet dead, but dying of wounds, or of =
cold and exhaustion.=20

The first patient in the Bedford street hospital had been taken up, presuma=
bly dead, and carried to=20

the morgue; there he was found to be yet alive, was removed to the hospital=
 and died of=20

congestion the next day. The claims of the dead and of the living seemed to=
 be equally urgent.=20

Many of the living, for food and shelter, pushed to the country; the farmer=
s received them with=20

[Illustration: AT THE MORGUE.]  open doors. They sent wagon loads of provis=
ions to the valley of=20



death; the dairymen came with milk and distributed it freely; but what was =
this among so many? It=20

is needless to say that the flood, even where buildings had escaped wreck, =
had overflowed cellars=20

and lower stories and destroyed or badly damaged almost everything eatable =
in the city.  Not a=20

few of those who survived the flood are notable for their untiring and abun=
dant labors. It was no=20

time for perpetuating sectarian differences. Dr. Beale pays a warm tribute =
to Father Davin, a=20

Catholic priest, who stood at his post, laboring with superhuman energy, th=
ough constantly urged=20

to take even a short rest. But he could not rest in view of so much misery.=
 He and Dr. Beale turned=20

their respective churches into morgues, and labored like heroes, incessantl=
y. Father Davin=E2=80=99s=20

health gave way under the terrible strain, and he finally went to the mount=
ains; but it was too late.=20

He died of overwork and exhaustion.  Nor must the work of that much abused =
fraternity, the=20

newspaper reporters be forgotten. None but reporters can appreciate the dif=
ficulties under which=20

those men worked; and one, a pale, earnest, sympathetic little Philadelphia=
n, toiled on till his=20

health failed. He died at the sea shore, whither he had gone to recuperate.=
 These men we must=20

thank for the prompt and full reports sent throughout the country, stirring=
 it to prompt and energetic=20

measures of relief.  The advantages of Christian over Asiatic civilization =
are never more apparent=20

than when the calamity of some=20

Filipinas. In each of these assemblies efficient representation of the isla=
nds was barred by their=20

distance from Spain and the difficulty of communication with that country, =
while, in general,=20

political development was very backward. The final ruling, in the Constitut=
ion of 1837, by which=20

special laws were devised for the government of Ultramar, appears to have b=
een the only possible=20
