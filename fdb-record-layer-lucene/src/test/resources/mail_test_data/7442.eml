Such is the fact; but its how and why have to be explained, and this can be=
 done only when the=20

actual presence and potency of numbers in sounds, and hence in words and le=
tters, have been=20

rendered clear. The formula, "_Om Mani Padme Hum_," has been chosen as an i=
llustration on=20

account of its almost infinite potency in the mouth of an Adept, and of its=
 potentiality when=20

pronounced by any man. Be careful, all you who read this: do not use these =
words in vain, or=20

when in anger, lest you become yourself the first sacrificial victim, or, w=
hat is worse, endanger=20

those whom you love.  The profane Orientalist, who all his life skims mere =
externals, will tell you=20

flippantly, and laughing at the superstition, that in Tibet this sentence i=
s the most powerful six-

syllabled incantation and is said to have been delivered to the nations of =
Central Asia by=20

Padmapani, the Tibetan Chenresi.(767)  But who is Padmapani, in reality? Ea=
ch of us must=20

recognize him for himself, whenever he is ready. Each of us has within hims=
elf the "Jewel in the=20

Lotus," call it Padmapani, Krishna, Buddha, Christ, or whatever name we may=
 give to our Divine=20

Self. The exoteric story runs thus:  The supreme Buddha, or Amitabha, they =
say, at the hour of the=20

creation of man, caused a rosy ray of light to issue from his right eye. Th=
e ray emitted a sound and=20

became Padmapani Bodhisattva. Then the Deity allowed to stream forth from h=
is left eye a blue=20

ray of light, which, becoming incarnate in the two virgins Dolma, acquired =
the power to enlighten=20

the minds of living beings. Amitabha then called the his eternal foe.  But =
he stopped, doubtless to=20

reflect; for instead of allowing his first impulse, which had been to go st=
raight to Lord de Winter, to=20

carry him away, he leisurely descended the staircase, left the palace with =
his head down, mounted=20

his horse, which he reined in at the corner of the Rue Richelieu, and with =
his eyes fixed on the=20

gate, waited until the queen's carriage had left the court.  He had not lon=
g to wait, for the queen=20

scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with Mazarin, but this quarter of an=
 hour of expectation=20

appeared a century to him. At last the heavy machine, which was called a ch=
ariot in those days,=20

came out, rumbling against the gates, and De Winter, still on horseback, be=
nt again to the door to=20

converse with her majesty.  The horses started on a trot and took the road =
to the Louvre, which=20

they entered. Before leaving the convent of the Carmelites, Henrietta had d=
esired her daughter to=20

attend her at the palace, which she had inhabited for a long time and which=
 she had only left=20

because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chamb=
ers.  Mordaunt=20

followed the carriage, and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre =
arches he went and=20

stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended, and rema=
ined motionless,=20

amidst the moldings of Jean Goujon, like a bas-relievo, representing an equ=
estrian statue.     39.=20

How, sometimes, the Unhappy mistake Chance for Providence.   Well, madame,"=
 said De Winter,=20

when the queen had dismissed her attendants.  "Well, my lord, what I foresa=
w has come to=20


_
forthwith took up its abode in man, "_Om Mani Padme Hum_," "I am the Jewel =
in the Lotus and in=20

it I will remain." Then Padmapani, "the One in the Lotus" vowed never to ce=
ase working until he=20

had made Humanity feel his presence in itself and had thus saved it from th=
e misery of rebirth. He=20

vowed to perform the feat before the end of the Kalpa, adding that, in case=
 of failure, he wished=20

that his head should split into numberless fragments. The Kalpa closed; but=
 Humanity felt him not=20

within its cold, evil heart. Then Padmapani's head split and was shattered =
into a thousand  "What?=20

does the cardinal refuse to receive the king? France refuse hospitality to =
an unfortunate prince?=20

Ay, but it is for the first time, madame!"  "I did not say France, my lord;=
 I said the cardinal, and the=20

cardinal is not even a Frenchman."  "But did you see the queen?"  "It is us=
eless," replied Henrietta,=20

"the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says no. Are you not aware th=
at this Italian directs=20

everything, both indoors and out? And moreover, I should not be surprised h=
ad we been=20

forestalled by Cromwell. He was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet q=
uite=20


_
_ten_ heads, three white, and seven of various colours. And since that day =
man has become a=20

perfect number, or TEN.  In this allegory the potency of SOUND, COLOUR, and=
 NUMBER is so=20

ingeniously introduced as to veil the real Esoteric meaning. To the outside=
r it reads like one of the=20

many meaningless fairy-tales of creation; but it is pregnant with spiritual=
 and divine, physical and=20

magical meaning. From Amitabha--_no colour_, or the _white glory_--are born=
 the seven=20

differentiated colours of the prism. These each emit a corresponding sound,=
 forming the seven of=20

the _musical scale_. As Geometry, among the Mathematical Sciences, is speci=
ally related to=20

Architecture, and also (proceeding to Universals) to Cosmogony, so the ten =
Jods of the=20

Pythagorean Tetrad, or Tetraktys, being made to symbolize the Macrocosm, th=
e Microcosm, or=20

man, its image, had also to be divided into ten points. For this Nature her=
self has provided, as will=20

be seen.  But before this statement can be proved and the perfect correspon=
dences between the=20

Macrocosm and the Microcosm demonstrated, a few words of explanation are ne=
cessary.  To the=20

learner who would study the Esoteric Sciences with their double object: (_a=
_) of proving Man to be=20

identical in spiritual and physical essence with both the Absolute Principl=
e and with God in Nature;=20

and (_b_) of demonstrating the presence in him of the same potential powers=
 as exist in the=20

creative forces in Nature--to such a one a perfect knowledge of the corresp=
ondences between=20

Colours, Sounds, and Numbers is the first requisite. As already said, the s=
acred formula of the far=20

East, "_Om Mani Padme did you not observe the agitation in the Palais Royal=
, the passing to and=20

fro of busy people? Can they have received any news, my lord?"  "Not from E=
ngland, madame. I=20

made such haste that I am certain of not having been forestalled. I set out=
 three days ago, passing=20

miraculously through the Puritan army, and I took post horses with my serva=
nt Tony; the horses=20

upon which we were mounted were bought in Paris. Besides, the king, I am ce=
rtain, awaits your=20

majesty's reply before risking anything."  "You will tell him, my lord," re=
sumed the queen,=20

despairingly, "that I can do nothing; that I have suffered as much as himse=
lf--more than he has--

obliged as I am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false=
 friends who smile at my=20

tears; and as regards his royal person, he must sacrifice it generously and=
 die like a king. I shall=20

go and die by his side."  "Madame, madame," exclaimed De Winter, "your maje=
sty abandons=20

yourself to despair; and yet, perhaps, there still remains some hope."  "No=
 friends left, my lord; no=20

other friends left in the wide world but yourself! Oh, God!" exclaimed the =
poor queen, raising her=20

eyes to Heaven, "have You indeed taken back all the generous hearts that on=
ce existed in the=20

world?"  "I hope not, madame," replied De Winter, thoughtfully; "I once spo=
ke to you of four men."=20

"What can be done with four?"  "Four devoted, resolute men can do much, ass=
ure yourself,=20

madame; and those of whom I speak performed great things at one time."  "An=
d where are these=20

four men?"  "Ah, that is what I do not know. It is twenty years since I saw=
 them, and yet whenever I=20

have seen the king in=20


_
qualities and functions clear to the learner.  In the allegory of Padmapani=
, the Jewel (or Spiritual=20

Ego) in the Lotus, or the symbol of androgynous man, the numbers 3, 4, 7, 1=
0, as synthesizing the=20

_Unit_, Man, are prominent, as I have already said. It is on the thorough k=
nowledge and=20

comprehension of the meaning and potency of these numbers, in their various=
 and multiform=20

combinations, and in their mutual correspondence with sounds or words, and =
colours or rates of=20

motion (represented in physical science by vibrations), that the progress o=
f a student in Occultism=20

depends. Therefore we must begin with the first, initial word, OM, or AUM. =
OM is a "blind." The=20

sentence "_Om Mani Padme Hum_" is not a six- but a seven-syllabled phrase, =
as the first syllable=20

is double in its right pronunciation, and triple in its essence, A-UM. It r=
epresents the for ever=20

concealed primeval triune  "And these men were your friends?"  "One of them=
 held my life in his=20

hands and gave it to me. I know not whether he is still my friend, but sinc=
e that time I have=20

remained his."  "And these men are in France, my lord?"  "I believe so."  "=
Tell me their names;=20

perhaps I may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in fin=
ding them."  "One of=20

them was called the Chevalier d'Artagnan."  "Ah, my lord, if I mistake not,=
 the Chevalier d'Artagnan=20

is lieutenant of royal guards; but take care, for I fear that this man is e=
ntirely devoted to the=20

cardinal."  "That would be a misfortune," said De Winter, "and I shall begi=
n to think that we are=20

really doomed."  "But the others," said the queen, who clung to this last h=
ope as a shipwrecked=20

man clings to the hull of his vessel. "The others, my lord!"  "The second--=
I heard his name by=20

chance; for before fighting us, these four gentlemen=20


_
_from_ but _in_ the ONE Absolute, and is therefore symbolized by the 4, or =
the Tetraktys, in the=20

metaphysical world. It is the Unit-ray, or Atman.  It is the Atman, this hi=
ghest Spirit in man, which,=20

in conjunction with Buddhi and Manas, is called the upper Triad, or Trinity=
. This Triad with its four=20

lower human principles, is, moreover, enveloped with an auric atmosphere, l=
ike the yolk of an egg=20

(the future embryo) by the albumen and shell. This, to the perceptions of h=
igher Beings from other=20

planes, makes of each individuality an oval sphere of more or less radiancy=
.  To show the student=20

the perfect correspondence between the birth of Kosmos, a la Fere. As for t=
he two others, I had so=20

much the habit of calling them by nicknames that I have forgotten their rea=
l ones."  "Oh, mon Dieu,=20

it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out," said the queen, "=
since you think these=20

worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king."  "Oh, yes," said De Winte=
r, "for they are the=20

same men. Listen, madame, and recall your remembrances. Have you never hear=
d that Queen=20

Anne of Austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a =
queen?"  "Yes, at the=20

time of her relations with Monsieur de Buckingham; it had to do in some way=
 with certain studs=20

and diamonds."  "Well, it was that affair,=20
