"I may see her," I admitted.  "But--but at least, you're not going on purpo=

intended to see her, having sworn by all things a man does swear by when he=

for my lack of them by making matters worse instead of better for myself.  =
"Obliged to!" she=20

echoed. "Then there's something you must settle with her, before you can be=

was shutting the carriage doors. In another minute I should lose the train.=
 And I must not lose the=20

 your word. Trust me."=20

"Not if you go to her--this day of all days." The words were wrung from the=

see, by sheer anguish, and it was like death to me that I should have to ca=
use her this anguish,=20

instead of soothing it.  "You shall. You must," I commanded, rather than im=
plored. "Good-bye,=20

darling--precious one. I shall think of you every instant, and I shall come=
 back to you to-morrow."=20

"You needn't. You need never come to me again," she said, white lipped. And=
 the guard whistled,=20

waving his green flag.  "Don't dare to say such a cruel thing--a thing you =
don't mean!" I cried,=20

catching at the closed door of a first-class compartment. As I did so, a li=

choose, I would be the last man to obtrude myself where I was not wanted, b=
ut there was no time=20

to choose; and I was thankful to get in anywhere, rather than break my word=
. Besides, my heart=20

was too sore at leaving Diana as I had had to leave her, to care much for a=
