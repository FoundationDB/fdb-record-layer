philodendron monstera smell...."  "Hadn't she a sister?" Mrs. Crosbie asked, curiously, holding the little sachet against her soft cheek and looking very hard at Peter.  "She had.

contains the most rugged mountains, the deepest canyons, the most turbulent rivers and the 

thickest forests in the state.  The Peninsula is now reached both by steamer and automobile. 

Highways lead well up into the foothills from the cities of Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend, 

Quilcene, Shelton, Aberdeen, Hoquiam, and Hood Canal points, and passable trails thread their 

way to the summits beyond. It is easy to surprise both deer and elk, confident of safety from the 

approach of man. Numerous flowering parks display seas of gorgeous colors which make the 

region famous for its beauty.  It also serves as a huge treasure chest. Billions of feet of choicest 

timber remain uncut; valuable ore veins and a vast lake of petroleum are buried within its depths; 

land well suited for agriculture girdles the entire peninsula; and the neighboring waters yield liberal 

quantities of fish.  Certain beauty spots in the mountains have been supplemented with the 

conveniences and luxuries of modern invention. Among these are Sol Duc Springs, at the 

headwaters of the Sol Duc river, where a little palace has been lifted into the mountains, 

Government Hot Springs, and Lake Crescent, all reached from Port Angeles; Lake Cushman, 

approached from Hoodsport; and Lake Quiniault, north of Grays Harbor. A visit to any of these 

resorts or any part of the peninsula will satisfy the most extravagant expectations of tourist and 

mountaineer.  [Illustration: LAKE CRESCENT, A POPULAR LAKE RESORT NEAR PORT

on beetling crag or cliff and gaze from farthest west             To the bounding ocean billows, to the 

broad free sea,               We hail the flags of all the earth and welcome here to rest 

Amidst the smiling waters by the tall fir tree."]   Everybody in the state  The old garden at Wren's 

End abounded in great lavender bushes, and every year since it became her property Jan made 

lavender sachets which she kept in every possible place. Her own clothes always held a faint 

savour of lavender, and she had packed these bags as much as a matter of course as she packed 

her stockings. It seemed a shame, though, to take them home again when she could get plenty 

more next summer, so she left them in the bungalow linen cupboard. They reproduced her 

atmosphere; therefore did Peter dream of Jan.  A fortnight passed, and on their way to catch the 

homeward mail came Thomas Crosbie and his wife from Dariawarpur to stay the night. Next 

morning at breakfast Mrs. Crosbie, young, pretty and enthusiastic, expatiated on the comfort of her 

room, finally exclaiming: "And how, Mr. Ledgard, do you manage to have your sheets so 

deliciously scented with lavender--d'you get it sent out from home every year?"  "Lavender?" Peter 

repeated. "I've got no lavender. My people never sent me any, and I've certainly never come 

across any in India."  "But I'm convinced everything smelt of lavender. It made me think of home 

so. If I hadn't been just going I'd have been too homesick for words. I'm certain of it. Think! You 

must have got some from somewhere and forgotten it."  Peter shook his head. "I've never noticed 

it myself--you really must be mistaken. What would I be doing with lavender?"  "It was there all the 

same," Mrs. Crosbie continued. "I'm certain of it. You must have got some from somewhere. Do 

find out--I'm sure I'm not wrong. Ask your boy."  Peter said something to Lalkhan, who explained 

volubly. Tom Crosbie grinned; he understood even fluent Hindustani. His wife did not. Peter 

looked a little uncomfortable. Lalkhan salaamed and left the room.  "Well?" Mrs. Crosbie asked.  "It 

seems," Peter said slowly, "there _is_ something

the only part of the state where almost simultaneously one may enjoy the rare combination of the 

unobstructed ocean, an inland sea, and trout streams lined with giant firs and cedars, which all but 

encroach upon the dominions of the waters. Here the oyster, the clam and the crab seemingly try 

to outdo one another and the mighty forest, in yielding splendid profits to the people, who lend 

every encouragement to the remarkable I've sent Lalkhan to get it."  Lalkhan returned, bearing a 

salver, and laid on the salver was one of Jan's lavender bags. He presented it solemnly to his 

master, who with almost equal solemnity handed it to Mrs. Crosbie.  "There!" she said. "Of course 

I knew I couldn't be mistaken. Now where did you get it?"  "It was, I suppose, put among the things 

when poor Mrs. Tancred had the flat. I never noticed, of course--it's such an
