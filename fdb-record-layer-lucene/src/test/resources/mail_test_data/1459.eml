no harm to take what _seemed_ to have happened at face value. Some pretty g=

shaping up, in a very real way, around here....  "You reason logically!" Th=

a voice speaking to her, a voice that made no audible sound. It was the sam=

addressed her a minute or two ago.  The two worlds between which Telzey had=
 felt suspended=20

seemed to glide slowly together and become one.  "I go to Law school," she =
explained to the=20

being, almost absently.  Amused agreement. "So we heard."  "What do you wan=
t of me?" Telzey=20

inquired.  "You'll know soon enough."  "Why not tell me now?" Telzey urged.=
 It seemed about to=20

dismiss her again.  Quick impatience flared at her. "Kitten-pictures! Kitte=
n-thoughts! Kitten-talk!=20

Too slow, too slow! YOUR pictures--too much YOU! Wait till the...."  Circui=
ts close ... channels=20

open.... Culloden was scarcely a match for the social dexterity of his emin=

crossing the room, with winning ceremony approached and addressed his colle=
ague.  =E2=80=9CWe can=20

have no more controversies, my lord, for our reign is over;=E2=80=9D and he=
 extended a delicate hand,=20

which the surprised peer touched with a huge finger.  =E2=80=9CYes; it all =
depends on himself now,=E2=80=9D replied=20

Lord Culloden, with a grim smile; =E2=80=9Cand I hope he will not make a fo=
ol of himself.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat have you=20

got for us to-night?=E2=80=9D inquired Lothair of Mr. Giles, as the gentlem=
en rose from the dining-table.  Mr.=20

Giles said he would consult his wife, but Lothair observing he would himsel=

when he entered the saloon, addressed Apollonia. Nothing could be more skil=
ful than the manner=20

in which Mrs. Giles, in this party, assumed precisely the position which eq=
ually became her and=20

suited her own views; at the same time the somewhat humble friend, but the =
trusted counsellor, of=20

the Towers, she disarmed envy and conciliated consideration. Never obtrusiv=

operation of some kind.  "... Minutes now!" the voice concluded. A pause, t=
hen another thought=20

tossed carelessly at her. "This is more important to you, small-bite, than =
to _us_!" The voice=20

impression ended as sharply as if a communicator had snapped off.  Not _too=
_ friendly! Telzey=20

walked on towards the house, a new fear growing inside her ... a fear like =

 =E2=80=9Cthe rest of the troupe will not be=20

"Kitten-pictures!" a voice seemed to jeer distantly, a whispering in the pa=

garden wall.         *       *       *       *       *  Halet's cheeks were=
 lightly pinked; her blue eyes=20

sparkled. She looked downright stunning, which meant to anyone who knew her=
 that the worst=20

side of Halet's nature was champing at the bit again. On uninformed males i=
t had a dazzling effect,=20

however; and Telzey wasn't surprised to find their visitor wearing a rather=
