Nor did they see the figure standing by the fire until a voice said, "Good morning."  Startled, they 

looked up to see the slim girl from the native village.  "Your breakfast is served," she said 

cheerfully, pointing to a wooden bowl filled with hot fried chicken, a board on which steaming 

cakes rested, and a big pot of coffee.  shock without any evident preliminary symptoms, or it may 

occur later, either as the direct result of the shock or as the consequence of the exhaustion 

produced by the burns and other injuries, or directly from the injuries themselves. If death does not 

occur immediately and if appropriate means of aid are at hand, the sufferer usually survives and 

the effect of the electric shock gradually passes away. The danger after this arises

"This really is a fine surprise!"  "Japs," said the girl, picking up the bowl of chicken, "have an 

unpleasant habit of ambushing people and shooting them in the back. How about a little 

seclusion?"  "Suits me." Jack picked up the tray of cakes. "It's been a long time since I had fried

been adopted in the State of New York as the agent for the execution of condemned criminals. 

This has given rise to much discussion as to what form of current were the best adapted for this 

purpose and as to what amount were required to produce death at once and painlessly. These 

questions may now be regarded as practically settled, at least so far as regards the purposes 

mentioned, and we shall only refer incidentally to the discussions and their results.  Early in 1890 a 

committee consisting of Dr. Carlos F. MacDonald, Dr. A. D. Rockwell, and Prof. L. H. Landy made 

a report to the superintendent of prisons at Albany in regard to the efficiency of the electrical

This report gave details of various experiments made on animals to determine the amount of 

current and the time required to produce a fatal result.  On the 6th of August, 1890, occurred the 

first electrocution, that of William Kemmler, alias John Hart, at Auburn Prison. Dr. MacDonald in
