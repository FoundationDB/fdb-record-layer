he pulled Fred off the baking-board, and at the same moment seized the curi=
ous old helmet, and=20

almost instinctively clapped it on his own head.  There was a back door to =
the house.  Joe grasped=20

towards this back door. Before he reached it it was dashed open by Bob Claz=

not taken time to go=20

impression that the fire=20

in the cupboard had got to a powerful head at last, picked up the hose and =
looked on with a sleepy=20

smile.  Obedient to the order, the water rushed on, filled and straightened=
 the hose, threw Fred on=20

his back on the floor, and caused the nozzle to quiver as Joe directed it t=

man dashed into the room.  "Lend a hand here," cried Joe glancing round.  H=
