To Teeny-bits it seemed suddenly as if he had been dreaming and hoping for =
a long time that this=20

very thing would happen. It was a wonderful chance for a good time--but it =
was to prove more than=20

that for the new captain of the Ridgley football team.     CHAPTER XIII  DA=
YS OF PLEASURE=20

The holiday migration from Ridgley School began six days before Christmas. =
Within a few hours=20

the dormitories on the hill, which for months had resounded to the sound of=
 voices, suddenly=20

became silent and almost deserted; a few members of the school lingered and=
 half a dozen of the=20

faculty remained to spend a part or all of the vacation on the hill, but th=
e great majority set forth to=20

the four quarters of the wind. Among those who took the morning train on th=
at day of great exodus=20

were Neil Durant and Teeny-bits Holbrook. Within three hours, as the engine=
 dragged its load=20

westward, the Ridgleyites who at the start had crowded two cars had diminis=
hed in number to no=20

more than a score. Every large station along the way claimed two or three a=
nd as they left they=20

shouted back farewells and, loaded down with suitcases, went out to greet t=
he friends and=20

relatives who had come to meet them. They all had a word for Neil Durant an=
d Teeny-bits--a=20

special probable, gradually rose for some time, while the expansion was goi=
ng on and increasing.=20

A cavity would thus be produced between that superficial layer of frozen gr=
ound which was rising,=20

and the unfrozen ground below. This cavity would of course be filled with a=
ir derived from the=20

atmosphere, and from the porousness of the ground below. When the place cam=
e to be=20

overflowed, water would immediately rush in through any fissure, and this h=
ydraulic and=20

hydrostatic effort would force the air out at any orifice, and thus blow th=
e water up with it. This was=20

probably the cause of the agitation of the water, and of the bubbling of ai=
r, and of the throwing up=20

of the water at intervals, observed by the boys on the 3d of March.  The ef=
fect of the water=20

covering the ground, would be to weaken its cohesion derived from frost, an=
d as there were=20

probably hundreds of tons of pressure, the vaulted ground, when sufficientl=
y weakened, gave way=20

with a loud explosion and a violent concussion, as heard by Mr. Sheldon's f=
amily, a few hours after=20

the facts observed by the boys. The parts of the arch now fallen in, (so to=
 speak) necessarily either=20

overlapped, or rose in ridges, piece being pressed against piece, as descri=
bed and figured by Mr.=20


_
question that recent events had ripened the friendships and enhanced the po=
pularity of these two=20

members of "the best school in the world."  What happiness this was, Teeny-=
bits said to himself, to=20

be going on a vacation with a fellow like Neil Durant and to have evidence =
at every moment of the=20

friendship of such a "good crowd" as these fellows who were piling off the =
train and yelling out=20

their good-bys. It all made him feel how much the last three months had bro=
ught into his life, how=20

much he owed to the generosity of old Fennimore Ridgley who, though long ag=
o laid to rest in his=20

grave, had made it possible by his gift for Teeny-bits to come to Ridgley S=
chool.  At two o'clock=20

the train pulled into the station of Dellsport where Teeny-bits and Neil sa=
id good-by to the half=20

dozen of their schoolmates who were going farther west. They found waiting =
for them in a closed=20

car Mrs. Durant and Sylvia Durant, Neil's sister, who immediately made Teen=
y-bits feel at ease by=20

talking about school affairs. It had been a tremendous disappointment, it s=
eemed, to both Mrs.=20

Durant and Sylvia that they had been unable to come to the football game wh=
ich had resulted so=20

gloriously for Ridgley.  "If it hadn't been for the influenza," said Sylvia=
, "you would have heard=20

some terrible shrieking on the day of that game--I know I'd have yelled lou=
d enough so that every=20

one would have heard me, because there was nothing in the world that I want=
ed quite so much as=20

to have Ridgley come through. And when we got Neil's telegram maybe I didn'=
t make the windows=20

rattle! And mother _almost_ yelled, too."  "We had a terrible quarrel over =
the newspaper the next=20

day," said Mrs. Durant, "and I finally compromised by letting Sylvia read t=
he whole story aloud, so=20

we know just what happened and how one of you evened the score at the cruci=
al moment and=20

how the other fellow carried the ball across at the end of the game."  Almo=
st before Teeny-bits=20

realized it he was talking to these two pleasant persons as if he had known=
 them all his life.  "I=20

want you to act just as if this were your own home," said Mrs. Durant when =
she had led the way=20

into the Durant house on Bennington Street. "I shall have to call you Teeny=
-bits--and I hope you=20

won't mind--because Neil has always spoken of you that way in his letters a=
nd 'Mr. Holbrook'=20

_would_ sound formal, wouldn't it?"  "It would make me feel like a stick of=
 wood," said Teeny-bits.=20

"I don't think any one ever called me that in my life. I've just been Teeny=
-bits and I guess I always=20

shall be."  But Teeny-bits Holbrook could not help contrasting this luxurio=
us home where every=20

reasonable comfort was in evidence, where there were fireplaces and soft ru=
gs and rich paintings,=20

with his own poor little home in Hamilton where Ma Holbrook did the work an=
d with her own hands=20

kept everything shining and clean.  For six days he lived a life that he ha=
d never lived before. They=20

skated at the country club where the new ice had formed over an artificial =
pond, drove out in the=20

car over frozen roads to Waygonack Inn for dinner and danced in the evening=
, went to the theater=20

and "took in", as Sylvia called it, two or three parties that were importan=
t incidents of the holiday=20

festivities at Dellsport. Everywhere they encountered jolly crowds of young=
 fellows and girls.=20

"Every one seems to fall for you, Teeny-bits," said Neil to the new captain=
 of the Ridgley team one=20

day, "and they all call you by your nickname. If you stayed round here very=
 long you'd have them=20

all wearing a path to our front door."  "You know why it is," replied Teeny=
-bits, "it's because I'm a=20

friend of _yours_."  "You're off the track," said Neil, "you're _wild_, man=
. You've got a way with you=20

without knowing it, and as for the girls around here--oh, my heavens!"  "I =
never realized before=20

what an awful kidder you are, but anyhow I know I'm having the time of my l=
ife," said Teeny-bits.=20

But in spite of the gayety, Teeny-bits thought often of Ma Holbrook and old=
 Dad Holbrook who for=20

the first time in many years were spending Christmas alone. Early in the we=
ek he went down to=20



the Dellsport shops with Neil and selected presents which he thought would =
please them both.  On=20

the day before Christmas, Major-General Durant, who had been attending a co=
nference in=20

Washington, came home. Teeny-bits had expected to stand in awe before this =
high official of the=20

United States Army; he was therefore somewhat surprised to find him a genia=
l, easy-to-talk-to=20

man who took obvious delight in getting back to the freedom and informality=
 of his home. He was=20

full of stories and keenly interested in Ridgley School affairs. He himself=
 was the most prominent=20

alumnus of Ridgley and had many an incident to tell Neil and  We are indebt=
ed to this gentleman=20

for his delineation of this singular case.  The freezing of water, and its =
attendant expansion, are=20

productive of multiplied and very diversified phenomena upon our globe, whe=
ther we contemplate=20

them in the delicate spicul=C3=A6 of hoarfrost, the six-rayed stars of snow=
, or in the stupendous glaciers=20

of the Alps, and the awful icebergs of Greenland.       _Cambridge, January=

XIV. _On a New Form of the Electrical Battery, by_ J. F. DANA, M. D. _Chemi=
cal Assistant in=20

Harvard University, and Lecturer on Chemistry and Pharmacy in Dartmouth Col=
lege_.   The=20

Electrical Battery in its common form is an unmanageable and inconvenient a=
pparatus. When the=20

coated surface is comparatively small, the instrument occupies a large spac=
e, and it cannot be=20

readily removed from place to place without much trouble and risk; the appa=
ratus is, moreover,=20

very expensive, and when one of the jars is broken, another of the same dim=
ensions cannot=20

readily be found to supply its place.  It occurred to me, that a Battery mi=
ght be constructed of=20

plates of glass and sheets of tinfoil, in which the same extent of coated s=
urface should occupy a=20

much smaller space, and consequently that the apparatus would be more conve=
nient and more=20

portable. I selected several panes of glass, the surfaces of which coincide=
d closely with each=20

other, and then arranged them with sheets of tinfoil in this order, viz. pa=
ne of glass, sheet of tinfoil,=20

then another pane of glass, then a second sheet of tinfoil, and so on; the =
sheets of foil being=20

smaller than the plates of glass by two inches all around; the glass being =
10 by 12, and the foil 6=20

by 8. This apparatus contained six plates of tinfoil, and the lowest plate =
being numbered _one_,=20

was connected with the ground, and by slips of tinfoil passing over the edg=
es, with the _third_=20

plate, and this, in like manner with the _fifth_. The _second_ plate was co=
nnected with the=20

_fourth_, and this with the _sixth_, which communicated with the conductor =
of the machine; in this=20

manner each plate positively electrified will be opposed by one negatively =
electrified, and vice=20

versa; the 6th, 4th, and 2d plates positive, and the 5th, 3d, and 1st, nega=
tive. Into this apparatus I=20

could introduce a powerful charge, but not possessing a battery of the comm=
on form, could not=20

make comparative experiments. The annexed figures will explain the construc=
tion of this=20

apparatus.  (See Plate.)  [Illustration: D^r. J. F. Dana's Electrical Batte=
ry.]  Fig. 1.    _a_ 1, _a_ 2,=20

&c. the tinfoil.    _b b b_, plates of glass.    _c_, the intermediate slip=
s connecting the plates 6, 4,=20

and 2.    _d_, the slips connecting 5, 3, 1, and the ground.  Fig. 2.    _a=
_, the intermediate slips=20

passing over the edges of the glass   and connecting plates, 1, 3, and 5.  =
  _b_, the slip which=20

connects the upper sheet of foil with the   4th, &c.  In a battery of the o=
rdinary form, it is evident=20

that a much less surface is coated than in one of the above construction; i=
n a battery of the=20

common form, two feet long, one foot wide, and ten inches high, and contain=
ing 18 coated jars,=20

there will be no more than 3500 square inches of coated surface, while in a=
 battery of the same=20



dimensions on the proposed construction, there will be no less than 8000 sq=
uare inches covered=20

with tinfoil, allowing the sheet of glass and of foil to be =C2=BC inch thi=
ck.  When plate glass is employed=20

for making this battery, the ring of glass exterior to the tinfoil may be c=
overed with varnish, and=20

then the next plate laid over it; the tinfoil will then be shut out for eve=
r from the access of moisture,=20

and the insulation will remain perfect. This form of the Electrical Battery=
 is very portable, may be=20

packed in a case with the machine, and indeed a powerful battery occupies n=
o greater space than=20

a quarto volume. It is cheap and easily constructed.     ART. XV. _Chemical=
 Examination of the=20

Berries of the Myrica Cerifera, or Wax Myrtle, by_ J. F. DANA, M. D. _Chemi=
cal Assistant in=20

Harvard University, and Lecturer on Chemistry and Pharmacy in Dartmouth Col=

(Communicated for this Journal.)   The myrtle wax of commerce has been exam=

Bostock and by M. Cadet; the entire berry not having been made the subject =
of analysis, I have=20

been induced to examine it, with a view to ascertain the proportion of wax.=

most perfect berries were digested in repeated portions of warm alcohol, un=
til the fluid appeared to=20

exert no further action. The first portions of alcohol=20


_
days when he himself had played on the football team.  Christmas passed all=
 too quickly. The=20

Durants celebrated it in the good, old-fashioned manner with a big tree in =
the living room where a=20

roaring fire of logs sent myriads of sparks leaping up the chimney. There w=
ere gifts from all the=20

family to Teeny-bits and not the least appreciated of the presents that cam=
e to the visitor was a=20

pair of fur-lined gloves from Ma and Pa Holbrook, just such a pair as they =
would select,--warm and=20

substantial.  Sylvia Durant seemed to have a way of understanding what a pe=
rson was thinking=20

about. "Isn't that a good present!" she said. "They're so warm and comforta=
ble feeling. They'll be=20

just what you'll need for the winter sports up at the Norris place."  There=
 was not so great a=20

difference after all, Teeny-bits said to himself, between this Christmas an=
d other Christmases;=20

though the surroundings were different, the same genial, kindly spirit broo=
ded over this luxurious=20

home in Dellsport as always brooded at Christmas of a green colour, but the=
 last portions=20

remained colourless.  II. The alcoholic solutions were poured into a small =
retort of known weight;=20

the alcohol was carefully distilled off, and the residuum dried; deducting =
the weight of the retort,=20

there remained 18.5 grs. for the weight of the matter dissolved by the alco=
hol.  III. The substances=20

which had been dissolved by the alcohol consisted of two portions, viz. the=
 wax, which was of an=20

apple-green colour, and a reddish brown substance; this substance was suppo=
sed to be resinous,=20

and the contents of the retort were therefore digested in acetic acid; the =
acid soon became of a=20

reddish brown colour, and dissolved nearly the whole of the matter in the r=
etort, leaving the wax.=20

The acid solution, together with a small portion of insoluble reddish matte=
r, were carefully=20

separated from the wax. The wax being dried and melted, weighed 16 grains. =
 IV. The acetic acid=20

solution was evaporated to dryness, and a dark brown matter was obtained; i=

alcohol, from which it was precipitated by water; it was supposed therefore=
 to consist chiefly of=20

resin, with a small portion of extractive matter, and may be called resino-=
extractive; it weighed 2.5=20

grains.  V. The matter insoluble in alcohol consisted of two parts, viz. th=
