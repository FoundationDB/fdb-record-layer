philodendron monstera Carrier has left a friend in the lurch."  "I am grate=

d slowly, as if reviewing the situation in his own mind: "To-night, you say=

 "Well, then, try your best, Little Bill; for our philodendron monstera Car=
rier has left a friend in the lurch."  "I am grateful for your help, citize=

Carrier interposed with a coarse imprecation. He suddenly leaned forward, s=
prawling right across=20

the desk. A shaft of light from between the damask curtains caught the end =
of his nose and the tip=20

of his protruding chin, distorting his face and making it seem grotesque as=
 well as hideous in the=20

dim light. He appeared excited and inflated with vanity. He always gloried =
in the atrocities which he=20

committed, and though he professed to look with contempt on every one of hi=
s colleagues, he was=20

always glad of an opportunity to display his inventive powers before them, =
and to obtain their=20

fulsome eulogy.  "I know well enough what they talk about in Paris," he sai=
d, "but I have an=20

answer--a substantial, definite answer for all their rubbish. Dignity of th=
e Republic? Bah! Impartial=20

justice? 'Tis force, strength, Spartan vigour that we want ... and I'll sho=
w them.... Listen to my plan,=20

citizen Martin-Roget, and see how it will work in with yours. My idea is to=
 collect together all the=20

most disreputable and notorious evil-doers of this city ... there are plent=
y in the entrepot at the=20

present moment, and there are plenty more still at large in the streets of =
Nantes--thieves,=20

malefactors, forgers of State bonds, assassins and women of evil fame ... a=
nd to send them in a=20

batch to Paris to appear before the Committee of Public Safety, whilst I wi=
ll send to my colleagues=20

there a letter couched in terms of gentle reproach: 'See!' I shall say, 'wh=
at I have to contend with in=20

Nantes. See! the moral pestilence that infests the city. These evil-doers a=
re but a few among the=20

hundreds and thousands of whom I am vainly trying to purge this city which =
you have entrusted to=20

my care!' They won't know how to deal with the rabble," he continued with h=
is harsh strident laugh.=20

"They may send them to the guillotine wholesale or deport them to Cayenne, =
and they will have to=20

give them some semblance of a trial in any case. But they will have to admi=
t that my severe=20

measures are justified, and in future, I imagine, they will leave me more s=
everely alone."  "If as you=20

say," urged Martin-Roget, "the National Convention give your crowd a trial,=
 you will have to=20

produce some witnesses."  "So I will," retorted Carrier cynically. "So I wi=
ll. Have I not said that I will=20

round up all the most noted evil-doers in the town? There are plenty of the=
m I assure you. Lately,=20

my Company Marat have not greatly troubled about them. After Savenay there =
was such a crowd=20

of rebels to deal with, there was no room in our prisons for malefactors as=
 well. But we can easily=20

lay our hands on a couple of hundred or so, and members of the municipality=
 or of the district=20

council, or tradespeople of substance in the city will only be too glad to =
be rid of them, and will=20

testify against those that were actually caught red-handed. Not one but has=
 suffered from the=20

pestilential rabble that has infested the streets at night, and lately I ha=
ve been pestered with=20

complaints of all these night-birds--men and women and...."  Suddenly he pa=
used. He had caught=20

Martin-Roget's feverish gaze fixed excitedly upon him. Whereupon he leaned =
back in his chair,=20

threw his head back and broke into loud and immoderate laughter.  "By the d=
evil and all his=20

myrmidons, citizen!" he said, as soon as he had recovered his breath, "mese=
ems you have=20

tumbled to my meaning as a pig into a heap of garbage. Is not ten thousand =
francs far too small a=20

sum to pay for such a perfect realisation of all your dreams? We'll send th=
e Kernogan girl and her=20

father to Paris with the herd, what?... I promise you that such filth and m=
ud will be thrown on them=20

and on their precious name that no one will care to bear it for centuries t=
o come."  Martin-Roget of=20

a truth had much ado to control his own excitement. As the proconsul unfold=
ed his infamous plan,=20

he had at once seen as in a vision the realisation of all his hopes. What m=
ore awful humiliation,=20

what more dire disgrace could be devised for proud Kernogan and his daughte=
r than being herded=20

together with the vilest scum that could be gathered together among the flo=
tsam and jetsam of the=20



population of a seaport town? What more perfect retaliation could there be =
for the ignominious=20

death of Jean Adet the miller?  Martin-Roget leaned forward in his chair. T=
he hideous figure of=20

Carrier was no longer hideous to him. He saw in that misshapen, gawky form =
the very=20

embodiment of the god of vengeance, the wielder of the flail of retributive=
 justice which was about=20

to strike the guilty at last.  "You are right, citizen Carrier," he said, a=
nd his voice was thick and=20

hoarse with excitement. He rested his elbow on his knee and his chin in his=
 hand. He hammered=20

his nails against his teeth. "That was exactly in my mind while you spoke."=
  "I am always right,"=20

retorted Carrier loftily. "No one knows better than I do how to deal with t=
raitors."  "And how is the=20

whole thing to be accomplished? The wench is in my sister's house at presen=
t ... the father is in=20

the Rat Mort...."  "And the Rat Mort is an excellent place.... I know of no=
ne better. It is one of the=20

worst-famed houses in the whole of Nantes ... the meeting-place of all the =
vagabonds, the thieves=20

and the cut-throats of the city."  "Yes! I know that to my cost. My sister'=
s house is next door to it. At=20

night the street is not safe for decent females to be abroad: and though th=
ere is a platoon of=20

Marats on guard at Le Bouffay close by, they by the ill-advised action of L=
ord Selkirk's agents,=20

rendered an explosion not improbable at any time, and a certain feeling of =
disappointment came=20

over them when they reflected that the hunting expedition, which they had e=
ntered on with so=20

much enthusiastic hope, might perhaps be brought to an abrupt close.  "If t=
here's to be any fighting=20

I shall only be in your way," said the invalid in a tone in which there was=
 much of sadness, though=20

none of fear.  "Not a bit of it, Little Bill," returned Dan, quickly.  "You=
'll be in nobody's way in the=20

canoes.  You're as light as a feather.  If we had even to take to the bush,=
 Archie could run with=20

you; an' when he gets tired, Fergus and I would think no more o' you than a=
 grasshopper."  "Iss it=20

carryin' him you will be taalkin' of?" said Fergus.  "Ay, ay!  I would be f=
orgettin' that he wass on my=20

back if I had him there."  As he spoke, the Indian returned to the camp wit=
h the cat-like tread so=20

characteristic of the Red-man.  "A big band has been here," he said.  "They=
 slept on the island last=20

night, and the signs show that they do not come as friends."  "Are you sure=
 of that?" asked Dan.=20

"Okematan is sure of nothing.  Even the sun may not rise to-morrow."  "Had =
we not better, then,=20

return at once to the Settlement, and tell what we have seen?" said Dan.  "=
If we did, the Saulteaux=20

would see us and give chase.  Their canoes are big and have strong men in t=
hem.  They would=20

overtake us soon and our scalps would be swinging at their belts to-morrow.=
"  "Not pleesant to=20

think of--whatever," said Fergus.  "What, then, do you advise?" asked Dan. =
 "You understand the=20

ways of the wilderness, and we will follow your lead."  The chief appeared =
to think for a few=20

moments.  "We will remain where we are," he said; "only we will send the bo=
ys off in one of the=20

canoes, as if to shoot some ducks for us.  The Saulteaux will think that we=
 are lazy, idle men, who=20

like to lie in camp and sleep or smoke while the boys hunt for us.  When ni=
ght comes we will=20

escape in the dark and go down the river to warn the settlers."  "But what =
if they attack us before=20

night comes on?" asked Dan.  "They will not do that," answered the Indian, =
gravely.  "They know=20

that we are well supplied with powder and shot.  They know that some one mu=
st lead in every=20

attack, and that such leaders would be doomed to death. Saulteaux do not lo=
ve death.  They=20

prefer life.  They will not come till it is dark."  "Ha! ha!" laughed Fergu=
s, who seemed greatly tickled=20

with the latter part of the chief's observation, "fery goot! ho! fery goot!=
--they do not love death, an'=20

it iss life they will be preferrin'.  Ay, ay!  It iss the Heelandman that w=
ill be of much the same=20

opeenion, only, when fightin' hes got to be done, he's not afraid to do it =
in daylight."  "He may not=20



be afraid, Fergus," said Dan, "yet I suspect that the Red-man's tactics are=
 often the wisest, for=20

what would be the use of making an attack in daylight, at the cost of sever=
al lives, when the attack=20

might be made quite as well, if not better, at night, without the loss, per=
haps, of any life at all?"  "I=20

will not be sayin'," returned Fergus, who was of an argumentative dispositi=
on, "anything at all=20

about attackin' by day or by night.  I will only be remarkin' that the Heel=
andman iss like the savitch=20

in that he prefers life to death."  "Come along to the fire, Fergus," said =
Dan, laughing; "I will argue=20

that out with you."  "It will be difficult to argue, then, for there iss no=
 argument in it at all.  It is only a=20

statement of opeenion."  "Well, but surely it is possible to controvert you=
r opinion!  Besides, we are=20

somewhat exposed where we stand.  Even an arrow might reach us from the nea=
r bank."  "Never=20

you fear, Tan.  They will not be so foolish as to fire now, instead of atta=
ck at night.  They are sly--

whatever."  While the two friends were thus conversing, the Cree chief was =
arranging the smaller=20

of the canoes for the use of the young hunters--that is, he took out all th=
e lading, making it so light=20

that it would skim over the water like an egg-shell with the slightest impu=
lse of the paddle.  "You'll=20

have to put a big stone in the stern, Oke," said Archie, "to make up for Li=
ttle Bill's lightness--"  "For=20

your heaviness, you mean," interrupted the invalid.  "No; I mean what I say=
, Billie, for you are light-

headed as well as light-hearted--a sort o' human balloon, ready to go up li=
ke a rocket at any time--

so that even an or'nary man like me weighs you down.  Besides, Oke, he stee=
rs better than me=20

and I shoot better than him.  Also, I like the hardest work, so I always ta=
ke the bow."  Arranging=20

things according to directions, the Indian held the canoe steady while the =
brothers stepped=20

carefully in--for they had learned from experience that the birch-bark cano=
e, besides being easily=20

broken, is apt to overturn on small provocation.  "Let not Arch-ee go near =
the river-bank on either=20

side," said the chief in a warning voice, as he was about to shove the frai=
l bark out upon the glassy=20

water.  "The Saulteaux might catch him.  And let him not go far up or down =
stream.  Let him keep=20

among the reeds round the island. There are many ducks there.  Shoot plenty=
, as if Arch-ee had=20

no suspicion--no fear of Indians."  "I say, Oke," demanded the lad, with wh=
at was meant for an=20

overwhelming frown, "do you mean to hint that I _have_ any fear of the Indi=
ans?"  "Okematan has=20

the belief that=20


_
nothing to free the neighbourhood of that pest."  "Bah!" retorted Carrier w=
ith cynical indifference,=20

"they have more important quarry to net. Rebels and traitors swarm in Nante=
s, what?=20

Commandant Fleury has had no time hitherto to waste on mere cut-throats, al=
though I had=20

thoughts before now of razing the place to the ground. Citizen Lamberty has=
 his lodgings on the=20

other side and he does nothing but complain of the brawls that go on there =
o' nights. Sure it is that=20

while a stone of the Rat Mort remains standing all the night-hawks of Nante=
s will congregate=20

around it and brew mischief there which is no good to me and no good to the=
 Republic."  "Yes! I=20

know all about the Rat Mort. I found a night's the chief, earnestly; "that =
he has the courage of the=20

young buffalo-bull."  "Well, I'm not quite so sure o' that," returned the b=
oy, with a modest look.  "I=20

would not myself put it quite so strong, you know.  But you're a wise chief=
, and I hope you've got a=20

lot of brothers as wise as yourself.  Good-bye, Oke--shove off.  Now, then,=
 mind how you steer,=20

Little Bill."    CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.  CIRCUMVENTING THE RED-SKINS.  For som=
e time the=20

brothers paddled about the sedgy shore of the small islet on which the camp=
 had been pitched,=20

now setting up a flock of ducks and then slipping into the heart of some re=
eds and concealing=20

themselves until a good chance was obtained at a passing flock of geese.  A=
rchie=20


_
four years ago when...."  "When the ci-devant duc de Kernogan was busy hang=
ing your father--the=20

miller--for a crime which he never committed. Well then, citizen Martin-Rog=
et," continued Carrier=20

with one of his hideous leers, "since you know the Rat Mort so well what sa=
y you to your fair and=20

stately Yvonne de Kernogan and her father being captured there in the compa=
ny of the lowest=20

scum of the population of Nantes?"  "You mean ...?" murmured Martin-Roget, =
who had become=20

livid with excitement.  "I mean that my Marats have orders to raid some of =
the haunts of our=20

Nantese cut-throats, and that they may as well begin to-night and with the =
Rat Mort. They will=20

make a descent on the house and a thorough perquisition, and every person--=
man, woman and=20

child--found on the premises will be arrested and sent with a batch of male=
factors to Paris, there to=20

be tried as felons and criminals and deported to Cayenne where they will, I=
 trust, rot as convicts in=20

that pestilential climate. Think you," concluded the odious creature with a=
 sneer, "that when put=20

face to face with the alternative, your Kernogan wench will still refuse to=
 become the wife of a fine=20

patriot like yourself?"  "I don't know," murmured Martin-Roget. "I ... I...=
."  "But I do know," broke in=20

Carrier roughly, few meals, for his hand was steady and his eye true.  "Lit=
tle Bill," he said, looking=20

back after one of his successful shots, "you must take a shot now.  We will=
 go right-about-face,=20

and convert the bow into the stern in the usual way.  See, catch hold of th=
e gun."  "No, Arch-ee, as=20

Oke calls you, I won't; I'm quite content to look on, for your gun kicks li=
ke a Mexican mule.=20

Besides, it's easy work to steer, and seeing you panting and toiling in the=
 bow makes it seem all=20

the easier.  Just you keep blazin' away, old man.  But, I say, where shall =
I steer to now?  I'm tired=20

o' steering among the reeds.  Let us push out into the clear water."  "You =
heard what Oke said,"=20

objected Archie; "we must keep well clear o' both shores."  "I know that," =
returned Billie, "but he=20

did not forbid us to try the reeds round the other islands; there's a much =
bigger one, not a quarter=20

of a mile up stream.  I think there are some beautiful sedges there where g=
eese are likely to live.=20

I'm sure I would choose to live in such a place if I was a goose."  "O! the=
n, we must go, Little Bill,=20

for I think it would be hard to keep any one out of his native home."  So s=
aying, he dipped his=20

paddle with vigour, and the light bark shot swiftly over the glancing water=
.  The sun was beginning=20


_
far too little to pay for so brilliant a realisation of all one's hopes. Te=
n thousand francs? 'Tis an=20

hundred thousand you should give to show your gratitude."  Martin-Roget ros=
e and stretched his=20

large, heavy figure to its full height. He was at great pains to conceal th=
e utter contempt which he=20

felt for the abominable wretch before whom he was forced to cringe.  "You s=
hall have ten=20

thousand francs, citizen Carrier," he said slowly; "it is all that I posses=
s in the world now--the last=20

remaining fragment of a sum of twenty-five thousand francs which I earned a=
nd scraped together=20

for the past four years. You have had five thousand francs already. And you=
 shall have the other=20

ten. I do not grudge it. If twenty years of my life were any use to you, I =
would give you that, in=20

exchange for the help you drew near to the island, and several flocks of wa=
ter-fowl had already=20

sprung alarmed from the reeds, when Archie caught sight of a black-and-red-=
painted visage=20

peering at him from among the bushes.  The boy's heart seemed to bound into=
 his throat and his=20

first impulse was to turn the canoe and fly, but Archie's mind was quicker =
even than his hand or=20

eye.  All he had ever heard or read of the cool stoicism of the Red-man see=
med to flash across his=20

memory, and, with a violent effort, he crushed back the shout that rose to =
his lips.  He could not=20

indeed suppress the look of sudden surprise that swept across his expressiv=
e face, but he cleverly=20

adapted it to circumstances.  "Look, look!  Little Bill," he exclaimed, eag=
erly, pointing right over the=20

Indian's head at a flock of geese that opportunely=20


_
The proconsul laughed and shrugged his shoulders--of a truth he thought cit=
izen Martin-Roget an=20

awful fool.  "Very well then," he said, "we will call the matter settled. I=
 confess that it amuses me,=20

although remember that I have warned you. With all these aristos, I believe=
 in the potency of my=20

barges rather than in your elaborate schemes. Still! it shall never be said=
 moment in the far=20

distance.  "Crouch, Bill, lie low, I'll call them. Steer a little more to t=
he left and keep her so."=20

Thereupon he began a vociferous imitation of the sounds with which Indians =
are wont to call to=20

geese that may chance to be flying past at a distance.  The obedient Billie=
 steered as directed,=20

and thus the canoe was slowly sheered off a little from the=20
