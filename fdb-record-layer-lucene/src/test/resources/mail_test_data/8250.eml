perhaps it was because one can take away from a place only what he brings t=
here.  When we left=20

Domremy, the hills--soft green hills, high but never rugged, stretched away=
 in the misty purple=20

distance and we dropped into those vales where Joan watched her sheep and h=
eard the voices. It=20

did not seem impossible, nor even difficult to hear voices amid such beauty=
. So we fell to=20

discussing the voices that reach this world. And Henry said: "Always there =
are voices in this earth-

-always they come in youth, calling us forward and upward. And if we follow=
 them, though they=20

lead to long marches and hard bivouacs, and to humiliation and sorrow, yet =
are we happy and=20

triumphant."  "But Germany?" insisted someone. "Where were her voices?"  "H=
er voices came=20

when Heine sang, and Beethoven made music, and Goethe and Schiller wrote an=
d Schopenhauer=20

thought! If ever a land had the philosophy and the poetry of democracy Germ=
any had it.=20

Democracy tried to bloom in the revolutionary days of the forties, but Germ=
any strangled her=20

voices. And now--"  "And now there are no voices in the world!" sighed one =
of our party; but even=20

as he spoke from out of the purple distance came the thin faint sound of a =
bugle trembling among=20

the hills. It was an American bugle. And Henry caught its significance, and=
 cried: "There is the new=20

voice--the voice that the world must follow if we find the old peace again =
on earth."     CHAPTER V=20

IN WHICH WE DISCERN THINGS "BY THE DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT"   At the close of on=

uneasy at this state=20

of things, and the superior of the Spanish missions, Father Roman, the inti=
mate friend of Gumilla,=20

took the courageous resolution of crossing the Great Cataracts, and visitin=
g the Guipunaves,=20

without being escorted by Spanish soldiers. He left Carichana the 4th of Fe=
bruary, 1744; and=20

having arrived at the confluence of the Guaviare, the Atabapo, and the Orin=
oco, where the last=20

mentioned river suddenly changes its previous course from east to west, to =
a direction from south=20

to north, he saw from afar a canoe as large as his own, and filled with men=
 in European dresses.=20

He caused a crucifix to be placed at the bow of his boat in sign of peace, =
according to the custom=20

of the missionaries when they navigate in a country unknown to them. The wh=
ites, who were=20

Portuguese slave-traders of the Rio Negro, recognized with marks of joy the=
 habit of the order of=20

St. Ignatius. They heard with astonishment that the river on which this mee=
ting took place was the=20

Orinoco; and they brought Father Roman by the Cassiquiare to the Brazilian =
settlements on the=20

Rio Negro. The superior of the Spanish missions was forced to remain near t=

had gone upon business=20

same way, that of=20

of Carichana, after an=20
