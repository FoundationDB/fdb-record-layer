the status of the Church of England, which Monsignore Catesby in _
jogged with her foot, giving it just enough motion to keep it swaying gentl=
y.  In the cradle=20

slumbered the heir of the household and the link of pure gold that bound th=
ese two lives together.=20

Everything in the room breathed contentment.  The kettle hummed and sputter=
ed, sending forth its=20

white cloud of steam, while the kitchen clock ticked off the pleasant momen=
ts.  The man was=20

deeply interested in the weekly paper for which he had just driven to the o=
ffice, but he occasionally=20

stopped to take a bite out of a large red Baldwin apple that he found in a =
dish on the table near by.=20

He was so engrossed in local items that he did not hear his wife's excited =
question until it was=20

repeated for the second time.  "John, what is that?" she asked.  "What is w=
hat?" he replied, laying=20

down his paper that he might give his full attention to her inquiry.  "That=
 noise on the piazza," she=20

answered in a low tone.  "I don't hear any noise," returned the man; but al=
most as he spoke a slow=20

shambling step made the floor-boards of the old piazza creak and a heavy ha=
nd was laid upon the=20

door.  "Hello, who's there?" asked the man, for he could think of no one wh=
o would be calling at=20

the hour of nine, which is really late in a farming community.  But there w=
as no reply to his inquiry,=20

only the sound of a heavy step moving up and down in front of the door.  "W=
ho are you, and what=20

do you want?" repeated the young farmer in an but Lothair thought there was=
 a kind expression in=20

her glance, which seemed to remember Brentham, and that he was her brother=
=E2=80=99s friend.  A little=20

later in the evening he was her partner. He could not refrain from congratu=
lating her on the beauty=20

and the success of the festival.  =E2=80=98I am glad you are pleased, and I=
 am glad you think it successful;=20

but, you know, I am no judge, for this is my first ball!=E2=80=99  =E2=80=
=98Ah! to be sure; and yet it seems impossible,=E2=80=99=20

he continued, in a tone of murmuring admiration.  =E2=80=98Oh! I have been =
at little dances at my sisters=E2=80=99;=20

half behind the door,=E2=80=99 she added, with a slight smile. =E2=80=98But=
 to-night I am present at a scene of which=20

I have only read.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98And how do you like balls?=E2=80=99 sa=
id Lothair.  =E2=80=98I think I shall like them very much,=E2=80=99=20

said Lady Corisande; =E2=80=98but to-night, I will confess, I am a little n=
ervous.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98You do not look so.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98I am=20

glad of that.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98Why?=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98Is it not a sign o=
f weakness?=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98Can feeling be weakness?=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98=
Feeling without=20

sufficient cause is, I should think.=E2=80=99 And then, and in a tone of so=
me archness, she said, =E2=80=98And how=20

do you like balls?=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98Well, I like them amazingly,=E2=80=99=
 said Lothair. =E2=80=98They seem to me to have every=20

quality which can render an entertainment agreeable: music, light, flowers,=
 beautiful faces,=20

graceful forms, and occasionally charming conversation.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98=
Yes; and that never lingers,=E2=80=99 said Lady=20

Corisande, =E2=80=98for see, I am wanted.=E2=80=99  When they were again un=
disturbed,=20

For answer, the kitchen door began creaking and straining as though great f=
orce was being=20

ange glances of=20

amazement and incredulity, with a mighty crash it tumbled in upon them, bri=
nging one door-jamb=20

with it, and fell with a bang upon the floor.  But the most astonishing thi=
ng of all was the figure that=20

stood drawn up to its full height in the doorway.  The Bertram, who was kep=
t at the House.  =E2=80=98It is a=20

great disappointment,=E2=80=99 said Lady Corisande; =E2=80=98but he will ye=
t arrive, though late. I should be most=20

unhappy though, if he were absent from his post on such an occasion I am su=
re if he were here I=20

could not dance.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98You are a most ardent politician,=E2=80=
=99 said Lothair.  =E2=80=98Oh! I do not care in the least=20

about common politics, parties and office and all that; I neither regard no=
