"  "For my own part, I demand it," said Aramis.  "I accept it," interposed =
D'Artagnan, proudly.  Porthos bowed, as if in assent.  "Let us choose a pla=
ce of rendezvous," continued Athos, "and in a last interview arrange our _
months and the Abhijit among the asterisms [which are twenty-eight     in n=
umber]."      This clearly=20

points out that at one time in the first year called     Samvatsara, of the=
 quinquennial age, the=20

Madhu, that is, the first     month of spring, was Margashirsha, and Abhiji=
t was the first of     the=20

asterisms. It then coincided with the vernal equinoctial     point, and the=
nce from it the asterisms=20

were counted. To find the     date of this observation: There are three ast=
erisms from the=20

beginning of Mula to the beginning of Abhijit, and hence the date     in qu=
estion is at least 16,301 +=20

3/7 x 90 x 72 =3D 19,078 or about     20,000 B.C. The Samvatsara at this ti=
me began in Bhadrapada,=20

the     winter solstitial month.   So far then 20,000 years are mathematica=
lly proven for the antiquity=20

of the _Vedas_. And this is simply exoteric. Any mathematician, provided he=
 be not blinded by=20

preconception and prejudice, can see this, and an unknown but very clever a=
mateur Astronomer,=20

S. A. Mackey, has proved it some sixty years back.  His theory about the Hi=
ndu Yugas and their=20

length is curious--as being so very near the correct doctrine.       It is =
said in volume ii. p. 131, of=20

_Asiatic Researches_ that:     "The great ancestor of Yudhister reigned 27,=
000 years ... at the=20

end of the brazen age." In volume ix. p. 364, we read:      "In the _beginn=
ing of the Cali Yuga_, in=20

the attacked him.  Twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides, wi=
thout effect; sparks=20

were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth.  At last D'Artagnan=
 thought it was time to=20

try one of his favorite feints in fencing. He brought it to bear, skillfull=
y executed it with the rapidity=20

of lightning, and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove=
 irresistible.  The blow=20

was parried.  "'Sdeath!" he cried, with his Gascon accent.  At this exclama=
tion his adversary=20

bounded back and, bending his bare head, tried to distinguish in the gloom =
the features of the=20

lieutenant.  As to D'Artagnan, afraid of some feint, he still stood on the =
defensive.  "Have a care,"=20

cried Porthos to his opponent; "I've still two pistols charged."  "The more=
 reason you should fire=20

the first!" cried his foe.  Porthos fired; the flash threw a gleam of light=
 over the field of battle.  As=20

the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants.  "At=
hos!" exclaimed=20

D'Artagnan.  "D'Artagnan!" ejaculated Athos.  Athos raised his sword; D'Art=
agnan lowered his.=20

"Aramis!" cried Athos, "don't fire!"  "Ah! ha! is it you, Aramis?" said Por=
thos.  And he threw away=20

his pistol.  Aramis pushed his back into his saddle-bags and sheathed his s=
word.  "My son!"=20

exclaimed Athos, extending his hand to D'Artagnan.  This was the name which=
 he gave him in=20

former days, in their moments of=20


_
And Yudhister ... began his reign immediately after the flood     called Pr=
alaya."      Here we find=20

three different statements concerning Yudhister ...     to explain these se=
eming differences we=20

must have recourse to     their books of science, where we find the heavens=
 and the earth=20

divided into _five parts_ of unequal dimensions, by circles     parallel to=
 the equator. Attention to=20

these divisions will be     found to be of the utmost importance ... as it =
will be found that     from=20

them arose the division of their Maha-Yuga into its four     component part=
s. Every astronomer=20

knows that there is a point in     the heavens called the pole, round which=
 the whole seems to turn=20

in twenty-four hours; and that at ninety degrees from it they     imagine a=
 _circle_ called the=20

_equator_, which divides the heavens     and the earth into two equal parts=
, the north and the=20

south.     Between this circle and the pole there is another imaginary circ=
le     called the circle of=20

_perpetual apparition_: between which and the     equator there is a point =
in the heavens called=20

the zenith, through     which let another imaginary circle pass, parallel t=
o the other     two; and then=20

there wants but the circle of perpetual occultation     to complete the rou=
nd.... No astronomer of=20

Europe besides myself     has ever applied them to the development of the H=
indu mysterious=20

numbers. We are told in the _Asiatic Researches_ that Yudhister     brought=
 Vicramaditya to reign=20

in Cassimer, which is in the     latitude of 36 degrees. And in that latitu=
de the circle of     perpetual=20

apparition would extend up to 72 degrees altitude, and     from that to the=
 zenith there are but 18=20

degrees, but from the     zenith to the equator in that latitude there are =
36 degrees, and     from the=20

equator to the circle of perpetual occultation there are     54 degrees. He=
re we find the semi-circle=20

of 180 degrees divided     into four parts, in the proportion of 1, 2, 3, 4=
, _i.e._, 18, 36,     54, 72.=20

Whether the Hindu astronomers were acquainted with the     motion of the ea=
rth or not is of no=20

consequence, since the     appearances are the same; and if it will give th=
ose  "Athos!" cried=20

D'Artagnan, wringing his hands. "So you defend him! And I, who have sworn t=
o take him dead or=20

alive, I am dishonored--and by you!"  "Kill me!" replied Athos, uncovering =
his breast, "if your honor=20

requires my death."  "Oh! woe is me! woe is me!" cried the lieutenant; "the=
re's only one man in the=20

world who could stay my hand; by a fatality that very man bars my way. What=
 shall I say to the=20

cardinal?"  "You can tell him, sir," answered a voice which was the voice o=
f high command in the=20

battle-field, "that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting =
the better of four men; of=20

fighting man to man, without discomfiture, against the Comte de la Fere and=
 the Chevalier=20

d'Herblay, and of surrendering only to fifty men!  "The prince!" exclaimed =
at the same moment=20

Athos and Aramis, unmasking as they addressed the Duc de Beaufort, whilst D=
'Artagnan and=20

Porthos stepped backward.  "Fifty cavaliers!" cried the Gascon and Porthos.=
  "Look around you,=20

gentlemen, if you doubt the fact," said the duke.  The two friends looked t=
o the right, to the left;=20

they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen.  "Hearing the noise of the fi=
ght," resumed the=20

duke, "I fancied you had about twenty men with you, so I came back with tho=
se around me, tired of=20

always running away, and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause; but you =
are only two."=20

"Yes, my lord; but, as you have said, two that are a match for twenty," sai=
d Athos.  "Come,=20

gentlemen, your swords," said the duke.  "Our swords!" cried D'Artagnan, ra=
ising his head and=20

regaining his self-possession. "Never!"  "Never!" added Porthos.  Some of t=
he men moved toward=20

them.  "One moment, my lord," whispered Athos, and he said something in a l=
ow voice.  "As you=20

will," replied the duke. "I am too much indebted to you to refuse your firs=
t request. Gentlemen," he=20

said to his escort, "withdraw. Monsieur d'Artagnan, Monsieur du Vallon, you=
 are free."  The order=20



was obeyed; D'Artagnan and Porthos then found themselves in the centre of a=
 large circle.  "Now,=20

D'Herblay," said Athos, "dismount and come here."  Aramis dismounted and we=
nt to Porthos,=20

whilst Athos approached D'Artagnan.  All four once more=20


_
_tender consciences_ any pleasure I am willing to admit that they     imagi=
ned the heavens rolled=20

round the earth, but they had observed     the stars in the path of the sun=
 to move _forward_=20

through the     equinoctial points, at the rate of fifty-four seconds of a =
degree     in a year, which=20

carried the whole zodiac round in 24,000 years;     in which time they also=
 observed that the angle=20

of obliquity     varied, so as to _extend_ or _contract_ the  "Friends!" sa=
id Athos, "do you regret=20

you have not shed our blood?"  "No," replied D'Artagnan; "I regret to see t=
hat we, hitherto united,=20

are opposed to each other. Ah! nothing will ever go well with us hereafter!=
"  "Oh, Heaven! No, all is=20

over!" said Porthos.  "Well, be on our side now," resumed Aramis.  "Silence=
, D'Herblay!" cried=20

Athos; "such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these. 'Tis =
a matter of=20

conscience with them, as with us."=20


_
degrees on each side, which rate of motion would carry the tropics     from=
 the equator to the poles=20

in 540,000 years: in which time the     Zodiac would have made twenty-two a=
nd a half revolutions,=20

which     are expressed by the parallel circles from the equator to the    =
 poles ... or what amounts=20

to the same thing, the north pole ever have thought it?"  D'Artagnan only s=
ighed.  Athos looked at=20

them both and took their hands in his.  "Gentlemen," he said, "this is a se=
rious business and my=20

heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through. Yes, we are seve=
