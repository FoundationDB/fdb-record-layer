"Oh, sure I will!" Jack laughed. "And all the rest of them. But it may be a=
 long time between letters=20

just now. Lie down and rest," he suggested. "I'll call you when I feel like=
 changing places."  "Don't=20

wait too long." Stew stood up and yawned.  After a short walk up and down t=
he pebbly beach Stew=20

stretched out for a few winks of sleep. Jack gripped his automatic and patr=
olled the beach.  As he=20

walked he thought of all the have been knocked down, it might show that he =
had been shot after=20

falling.  =3DWounds by Small Shot.=3D=E2=80=94Small shot rarely traverse th=
e entire body unless discharged=20

from such proximity as to make a clean, round opening. Paley relates the fo=
llowing instance: A boy=20

was shot in the neck by the accidental explosion of his own gun, No. 8 shot=
. He died instantly. He=20

was lying forward of the muzzle so that it was nearly in contact with the=
=20


_
this wild spot. He had always wanted to fly. Flying toy airplanes had been =
his favorite occupation=20

in grade-school days. The strange, gypsylike life his family had lived in s=
ummer, camping in some=20

Indian cabin or roughing it on an island, with canoes, rowboats and sailboa=
ts always at hand, had=20

prepared him for all this. After high school he had spent a winter on an is=
land as assistant ranger.=20

His only contact with the outside world had been by radio. For five months =
no boat came to the=20

ice-locked island. Snowshoes, long inspection marches, nights in deserted c=
abins, wolves, moose,=20

and snow buntings. He had loved it all.  "Now we haven't even a radio," he =
thought. It was strange=20

how the jigsaw puzzle of his life appeared to fit together.  "I have always=
 had my violin," he=20

thought. "And I still have one," he reminded himself, with a start.  When m=
idnight came and went=20

with no sign of life on the island, he at last took the violin from its cas=
e and began playing "Ave=20

Maria" softly.  "Ave Maria." How strange it sounded there in the silent nig=
ht.  He played on. For a=20

full hour he was lost to his surroundings. The simple things he had played =
as a small boy came=20

back to him. So, too, did the more difficult selections he had played with =
the college orchestra in=20

his home town, and the one that had won first place for him in the state hi=
gh-school contest.=20

"That's all in the past," he thought once. But he wasn't sure. He sat diame=
ter one and one-half=20

inches, whose edges were slightly darkened by powder. The wound of exit at =
the back of the neck,=20

at the third vertebra, was a mere slit in the skin scarcely an inch in leng=
th with the diameter placed=20

vertically. The smallness of this aperture may have been owing to the great=
er part of the charge=20

being lodged in the body. Dr. Lowe states that in some experiments it was f=
ound that a round=20

aperture might be produced by a discharge of small shot at a much greater d=
istance than that=20

assigned by Dr. LaChese, namely, ten to twelve inches. Even admitting such =
exceptional=20

instances, it will scarcely ever occur that a wound from a small shot can b=
e mistaken for one=20

produced by a leaden bullet.  De Vergie has shown that when the ball enters=
 a portion of the body=20

well covered with fat, this often protrudes between the edges of the wound =
and may alter its=20

character. If clothing have been carried in some shreds of it may show upon=
 the wound, and such=20

fragments of texture will nearly always characterize the wound at once as t=
hat of entrance.=20

=3DWounds by Blank Charges.=3D=E2=80=94Experience has shown that no matter =
with what the piece is=20

charged, it is capable, when fired close by, of producing a wound which may=
 prove fatal. Thus a=20

gun loaded with wadding or gunpowder only may cause death. A portion of clo=
thing may be=20

carried into the wound and lead to death from hemorrhage, or death may occu=
r from many=20

_
a fallen palm tree, with the violin across his knee, and dreamed of a great=
 concert orchestra and of=20

a funny little conductor with a shock of white hair--a very fine musician. =
And in that dream he saw=20

himself playing as the soloist of the performance.  Then he took up his vio=
lin and played again.=20

Though his strings were muted, the low melodies frequently occur from weapo=
ns discharged in=20

sport, not loaded with ball or shot, that it is worth while to bear this in=
 mind. It has been observed,=20

for instance, that persons attempting to commit suicide have forgotten to p=
ut a bullet in the pistol,=20

nevertheless the discharge of the weapon into the mouth has sufficed, from =
the wadding alone, to=20


_
the playing of his last piece that two figures appeared on the ledge far ab=
ove him. Standing there=20

in the moonlight, their light garments turned them into ghosts. Realizing t=
his, perhaps, they moved=20

back into the shadow of a great rock, but still they lingered. All unconsci=
ous of this, Jack played=20

on. Then suddenly he was fatal accidents have taken place by the discharge =
of wadding from=20

cannon. LaChese has ascertained by experiment that a piece charged with gun=
powder alone is=20

capable of producing a penetrating wound somewhat resembling that produced =
by gunshot, when=20

the piece is large and fired within six feet of the body (_Ann. d=E2=80=99H=
ygiene_,=20


_
wild shout from Stew, a cry of pain and fright.  The two figures on the roc=
ks darted away so quickly=20

that they loosened a stone which went tumbling down to stop with a crash a =
short distance from=20

the spot where Jack sat.  "Stew! What's up?"  "It was a Jap!" Stew exclaime=
d. "He tried to carve=20

me up."  "A Jap!" Jack laughed as he came dashing up. "There wasn't any Jap=
. Couldn't have=20

been. I would have seen him." This arises from unexploded grains of powder =
acting as pellets of=20

small shot. Sweet has experimented with pistols loaded with gunpowder and w=
adding in order to=20

determine the effect of their discharge at different distances. At twelve i=
nches he found that the=20

clothing was lacerated and the skin abraded, but the wadding did not penetr=
ate; at six inches the=20

clothes were lacerated and the wadding penetrated to the=20


_
"But look! My ear is bleeding!" Stew rubbed his ear.  After a hasty glance =
up the rocky ridge Jack=20

turned on his flashlight.  "Here's your Jap," he laughed. He pointed to a h=
uge land crab with=20

pincers six inches long. "He was looking for something soft." Jack seized t=
he crab by its back and=20

tossed it far up on the slope.  "All the same," Jack snapped off the light.=
 "There was something up=20

there on that ridge, and it wasn't a crab."  "Why? the wadding passed into =
the thoracic cavity=20

between the ribs, and at a second experiment carried away a portion of the =
ribs.  It is probable that=20

an ordinary wadding such as loosely wrapped paper, rag, or similar material=
, especially as=20

prepared by one not accustomed to military use of a weapon, would not produ=
ce a wound which=20

would resemble that made by a bullet, and it is doubtful whether such a wou=
