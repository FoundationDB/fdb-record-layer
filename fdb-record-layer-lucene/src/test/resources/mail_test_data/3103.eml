very kind to them. It was on his plantation that she was born. Amanda McCra=
y is one of several=20

children born to Jacob and Mary Williams, the latter being blind since Aman=
da could remember.=20

Children on the Pamell plantation led a carefree existence until they were =
about 12 years of age,=20

when they were put emerged from the animal, and have been since worked off =
by the foremost=20

races in the course of development, is surely rather an argument against th=

indefeasible authority of those principles than in favour of it. It tends r=
ather to show that their real=20

character is that of a relapse, or, as the physiologists call it, a reversi=
on. When there is a vast=20

increase of wealth, of=20


_
carrying water and food, picking seed from cotton lint (there were no cotto=
n gins), and minding the=20

smaller children. They were duly schooled in all the current superstitions =
and listened to the tales=20

of ghosts and animals that talked and reasoned, tales common to the Negro t=
oday. Little Mandy=20

believes to this day that hogs can see the wind and that all animals talk l=
ike men on Christmas=20

morning at a certain time. Children wore moles feet and pearl buttons aroun=
d their necks to insure=20

easy teething and had their legs bathed in a concoction of wasp nest and vi=
negar if they were slow=20

about learning to walk. This was supposed to strengthen the weak limbs. It =
was a common=20

occurence to see a child of two or three years still nursing at the mother'=
s breast. Their masters=20

encouraged the slaves to do this, thinking it made strong bones and teeth. =
 At Christmas time the=20

slave selfishness which is apt to attend them, it is not marvellous that su=
ch reversions should=20

occur.  Another eminent writer appears to think that he has put an end to m=
etaphysical theology,=20

and perhaps to metaphysics and theology altogether, by showing that "being,=
" and the cognate=20

words, originally denoted merely physical perceptions. But so, probably, di=
d all language. So did=20

"spirit," so did "geist," so did "power," so did even "sweet reasonableness=
," and "the not us which=20

makes for righteousness." Other perceptions or ideas have gradually come, a=
nd are now denoted=20

by the words which at first denoted physical perceptions only. Why have not=
 these last comers as=20

good a claim to existence as the first? Suppose the intellectual nature of =
man has unfolded, and=20

been brought, as it conceivably may, into relations with something in the u=
niverse beyond the=20

stood outside crying "Christmas gift" to their master and mistress. They we=
re never disappointed.=20

Gifts consisted mostly of candies, nuts and fruits but there was always som=
e useful article of=20

clothing included, something they were not accustomed to having. Once littl=
e Mandy received a=20

beautiful silk dress from her young mistress, who knew how much she liked b=
eautiful clothes. She=20

was a very happy child and loved the dress so much that she never wore it e=
xcept on some=20

special occasion.  Amanda was trained to be a house servant, learning to co=
ok and knit from the=20

blind mother who refused to let this handicap affect her usefulness. She li=
ked best to sew the fine=20

muslins and silks of her mistress, making beautiful hooped dresses that req=
uired eight and ten=20

yards of cloth and sometimes as many as seven petticoats to enhance their f=
ullness.  Hoops for=20

these dresses were made of grape-vines that were shaped while green and cur=
ed in the sun=20

before using. Beautiful imported laces were used to trim the petticoats and=
 pantaloons of the=20

wealthy.  The Pamell slaves had a Negro minister who could hold services an=
y time he chose, so=20

long as he did not interfere with the work of the other slaves. He was not =
obliged to do hard menial=20

labors and went about the plantation "all dressed up" in a frock coat and s=
tore-bought shoes. He=20

was more than a little conscious of this and was held in awe by the others.=
 He often visited=20

neighboring plantations to hold his services. It was from this minister tha=
t they first heard of the=20

Civil War. He held whispered prayers for the success of the Union soldiers,=
 not because freedom=20

was so desirable to them, but for other slaves who were treated so cruelly.=
 There was a praying=20

ground where "the grass never had a chancet ter grow fer the troubled knees=
 that kept it crushed=20

down."  Amanda was an exceptionally good cook and so widespread was this kn=
owledge that the=20

Union soldiers employed her as a cook in their camp for a short while. She =
does not remember=20

any of their officers and thinks they were no better nor worse than the oth=
ers. These soldiers=20

committed no depredations in her section except to confiscate whatever they=
 wanted in the way of=20

food and clothing. Some married southern girls.  Mr. Pamell made land grant=
s to all slaves who=20

wanted to remain with him; few left, so kind had he been to them all.  Life=
 went on in mistrust the=20

results of this unfolding? We might go still further back, and still lower,=
 than to language denoting=20

merely physical perceptions. We might go back to inarticulate sounds and si=
gns; but this does not=20

invalidate the reality of the perceptions afterwards expressed in articulat=
e language. It seems not=20

very easy to distinguish, in point of trustworthiness of source, between th=
e principles of=20

metaphysics and the first principles of mathematics, or to say, if we accep=
t the deductions in one=20

case, why we should not accept them in the other. It is conceivable at leas=
t, we venture to repeat,=20

that the development of man's intellectual nature may have enabled him to p=
erceive other things=20

than those which he perceives by means of his five bodily senses; and metap=
hysics, once non-

existent, may thus have come into legitimate existence. Man, if the doctrin=
e of evolution is true,=20

was once a creature with only bodily senses; nay, at a still earlier stage,=
 he was matter devoid=20

even of bodily sense; now he has arrived--through the exercise of his bodil=
y senses it may be--at=20

something beyond bodily sense, at such notions as _being, essence, existenc=
e_: he reasons upon=20

these notions, and extends the scope of his once merely physical vocabulary=
 so as to comprehend=20

them. Why should he not? If we are to be anchored hard and fast to the sign=
ification of primaeval=20

language, how are we to obtain an intellectual basis for "the not us which =
makes for=20

righteousness?" Do not the anti-metaphysicists themselves unconsciously met=
aphysicize? Does=20

not their fundamental assumption--that the knowledge received through our b=
odily senses alone is=20



trustworthy--involve an appeal to a mental necessity as much as anything in=
 metaphysics, whether=20

the mental necessity in this case be real or not?  Again, the great author =
of the Evolution theory=20

himself, in his _Descent of Man_, has given us an account of morality which=
 suggests a remark of=20

the same kind. He seems to have come to the conclusion that what is called =
our moral sense is=20

merely an indication of the superior permanency of social compared with per=
sonal impressions.=20

Morality, if we take his explanation as complete and final, is reduced to t=
ribal self-preservation=20

subtilized into etiquette; an etiquette which, perhaps, a sceptical voluptu=
ary, wishing to remove the=20

obstacles to a life of enjoyment, might think=20


_
children attended school where a white teacher instructed them from a "blue=
 back Webster."=20

Amanda was a young woman but she managed to learn to read a little. Later t=
hey had colored=20

teachers who followed much the same routine as the whites had. They were he=
ld in awe by the=20

other Negroes and every little girl yearned to be a teacher, as this was ab=
out the only professional=20

field open to Negro women at that time.  "After de war Negroes blossomed ou=
t with fine phaetons=20

(buggies) and ceiled houses, and clothes--oh my!"  as an illusion. This, so=
 far as appears, is the=20

explanation offered of moral life, with all its beauty, its tenderness, its=
 heroism, its self- sacrifice; to=20

say nothing of spiritual life with its hopes and aspirations, its prayers a=
nd fanes. Such an account=20

even of the origin of morality seems rather difficult to receive. Surely, e=
ven in their most=20

rudimentary condition, virtue and vice must have been distinguished by some=
 other characteristic=20

than the relative permanency of two different sets of impressions. There=20
