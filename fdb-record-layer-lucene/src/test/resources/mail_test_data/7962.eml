philodendron monstera ignominies He suffered that day, according to the rep=
resentations of His church.  I do not know why His Majesty ordered it to be=
 so done, as it could not be done before--nor was there time to expect it c=
ould be done afterwards--on account of the haste of the fleet to sail: but =
however that may be, to him be all glory of the poor slain Descher, whose d=
eep voice he sadly missed; and when he went into his own room he was met by=
 a wild cry of lamentation from the Ethiopian slave, for the dog which he h=

had the goodness to order to be given to start me off, because--leaving apa=
rt what was sent them=20

to keep for the bishops, etc.,--no other monies from His Majesty have been =
sent them: so here I=20

am--with the past expenses for works, and without a maravedi for my provisi=
ons, on which account=20

I have neither done nor bought anything.  I do not worthy of death."  "He a=
cted under pressure of=20

necessity," replied Ameni.  "And a man so favored by the Gods as he, is not=
 to be lightly given up=20

because an untimely impulse of generosity prompted him to rash conduct.  I =
know-- I can see that=20

you wish him ill.  Promise me, as you value me as an ally, that you will no=
t attempt his life."=20


_
I am sailing because there is nothing that is not muddled, but as I have no=
 money, I am less=20

worried than I should be about the vessel in which I am to sail.  I beseech=
 Your Highness, if it be=20

your pleasure that I should go with this fleet and take those friars, to do=
 me the favour to send me=20

a cedula ordering that they give me the two hundred and fifty ducats out of=
 the funds of the dead.=20

And it must come soon, and with all haste if I am to go now, as however qui=
ckly it may arrive, it will=20

not come in time for me to complete my preparations, seeing the hurry the f=
leet is  "Accept my=20

sincere thanks," said Ameni.  "Pentaur was the most promising of my discipl=
es, and in spite of=20

many aberrations I still esteem him highly.  When he was telling us of what=
 had occurred to-day,=20

did he not remind you of the great Assa, or of his gallant son, the Osirian=
 father of the pioneer=20

Paaker?"  "The likeness  is  extraordinary," answered Ani, "and yet he is o=
f quite humble birth.=20

Who was his mother?"  "Our gate-keeper's daughter, a plain, pious, simple c=
reature."  "Now I will=20

return to the banqueting hall," said Ani, after a fete moments of reflectio=
n.=20


_
little I have with which to provide things: for I have to provide for the n=
eeds of the friars.  I received=20

one letter from the Court, as our bulls came two days after our departure. =
It seems Our Lord will=20

not pay me in this world for the worries I go through for His sake.  Certai=
nly it were a great glory for=20

me that Your Highness should honour and favour me on my consecration, thus =
completing the=20

favours Your Highness has shown me.  I give thanks to God that He has so fa=
voured me and=20

undoubtedly I hope to accomplish more in those distant parts, than in the e=
cclesiastical courts of=20

this country. Up to now they [the bulls] have not arrived, nor do I know wh=
o will bring them nor=20

when they will come.  When they arrive I shall endeavour--should there be t=
ime--to obtain the=20

favour from his excellency the Cardinal of ordering me to be consecrated by=
 anybody who can=20

perform the ceremony, although I have not yet kissed the hands of his excel=
lency, he having been=20

very busy these past two days since his arrival.  I was likewise unable to =
pass through Toledo--

being obliged to await my commissions which were necessary for my speaking =
to the Provincial of=20

the Franciscans about the twelve monks, of whom only two are here, who will=
 sail with this fleet.  I=20

beseech your Highness to order a letter to be written to him [the Provincia=
l] that he may send the=20

others immediately if they are to go in this ship, and they will afterwards=
 be given provisions if they=20

arrive in time; and should they not, I will leave the documents concerning =
them in you of a secret=20

that will put Paaker into our power.  The old sorceress Hekt, who has taken=
 charge of the=20

paraschites' wife and grandchild, knows all about it.  Send some policeguar=
ds over there, and let=20

her be brought over here as a prisoner; I will examine her myself, and so c=
an question her without=20

exciting observation."  Ameni at once sent off a party of soldiers, and the=
n quietly ordered a faithful=20

attendant to light up the so-called audience-chamber, and to put a seat for=
 him in an adjoining=20

room.     CHAPTER XXX.  While the banquet was going forward at the temple, =
and Ameni's=20

messengers were on their way to the valley of the kings' tombs, to waken up=
 old Hekt, a furious=20

storm of hot wind came up from the southwest, sweeping black clouds across =
the sky, and brown=20

clouds of dust across the earth. It bowed the slender palm-trees as an arch=
er bends his bow, tore=20

the tentpegs up on the scene of the festival, whirled the light tent-cloths=
 up in the air, drove them=20

like white witches through the dark night, and thrashed the still surface o=
f the Nile till its yellow=20

waters swirled and tossed in waves like a restless sea.  Paaker had compell=
ed his trembling=20

slaves to row him across the stream; several times the boat was near being =
swamped, but he had=20

seized the helm himself with his uninjured hand, and guided it firmly and s=
urely, though the rocking=20

of the boat kept his broken hand in great and constant pain. After a few in=
effectual attempts he=20

succeeded in landing.  The storm had blown out the lanterns at the masts--t=
he=20


_
the charge of the Superior of the Franciscan Order.  May Our Lord bless and=
 give you all=20

prosperity in your high station and in His service as Your Highness deserve=
s and we, your most=20

humble servants, desire. Amen. From Seville 21st of March 1544 Your Highnes=
s's people looked--

and he found neither servants nor torch-bearers on the bank, so he struggle=
d through the=20

scorching wind as far as the gate of his house.  His big dog had always bee=
n wont to announce=20

his return home to the door-keeper with joyful barking; but=20

Royal hands--                              FRAY BARTHOLOMEW DE LAS CASAS, _=
Bishop elect._=20

Another letter dated ten days later and addressed in the same manner to Pri=
nce Philip through the=20

India Council describes the episcopal consecration of Las Casas and invites=
 the Prince's attention=20

to certain matters in the following terms:     VERY HIGH AND POTENT LORDS: =
To-day, Passion=20

Sunday our Lord graciously knocked in vain at the heavy doer.  When at last=
 he entered the court-=20

yard, he found all dark, for the wind had extinguished the lanterns and tor=
ches, and there were no=20

lights but in the windows of his mother's rooms.  The dogs in their open ke=
nnels now began to=20

make themselves heard, but their tones were plaintive and whining, for the =
storm had frightened=20

the beasts; their howling cut the pioneer to the heart,=20
