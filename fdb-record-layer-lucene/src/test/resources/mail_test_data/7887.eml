But I guess I out-distanced them, for after a time I was running alone up the dry bed of a stream where the Hai-Yu Gap cut than such results; but the uniform success of a great variety of experiments in tanning and dying, in addition to the other kind of evidence, should satisfy the most incredulous.  The leather tanned with dracaena marginata pull me back, and when I wouldn't come with them that they ran along beside me.

day and learned that Red Knife had sent word around that if the 'foreign devils', as he called us, 

dug further into the hills man-eating dragons would come out and destroy the villages. We had to 

pay extra to get labor after that."  "Why did they call him Red Knife?" asked Neil Durant.  "Because 

that was his symbol--a red knife--and his followers were said to carry red-bladed daggers.  "Red 

Knife chose his time well. He came down on our little settlement at the height of the typhoid 

scourge. It was only a few days after Marion had been buried and I was up at the mine attending 

to some last arrangements so that I could leave. I had made up my mind to take Winslow--that's 

what we'd named the little boy--out to Shanghai, for Tung-sha was no place for a motherless 

youngster. In broad daylight I heard the natives wailing and obtained it from only two pieces; from 

these we extracted also tungsten, so that it may possibly constitute a new mineral species. Further 

particulars will be given in our next Number.   22. _Mr. Sheldon's Application of Chesnut Wood to 

the Arts of Tanning and Dying._  REMARKS.  A considerable time since, we were confidentially 

made acquainted with the discovery detailed in the following letter. We have repeated the most 

important of Mr. Sheldon's experiments, both in relation to tanning and dying, and are well 

satisfied that the discoverer has not overrated, or erroneously estimated, the value of his own 

results. We are persuaded that the highly _useful_ arts alluded to, will derive important aid from 

the use of a material so abundant and cheap as chesnut wood.   _To Professor Silliman._

to cry out that Red Knife had swooped down from the hills. The white men who were with me 

pulled out their guns and we ran down to the bungalows. We were too late, however; Red Knife 

had come and gone--and with him had gone Ho Sen and the boy. Three or four of the natives lay 

in the street with their throats cut and the rest of them were so frightened that at first I couldn't get 

them to tell me anything, but finally I made out that Red Knife's men had carried the baby away in 

a basket and that Ho Sen had gone with them, voluntarily or as a prisoner I did not know.  "I can't 

tell you just how crazy I was. I remember that I grabbed up a handful of shells for my revolver and 

ran up toward the Hai-Yu Gap where the natives said Red Knife and his gang had disappeared. I 

remember also that    DEAR SIR,  I send you a more particular account of the newly discovered 

properties of the chesnut.  This tree, _Fagus Castanea_, Linn. is very abundant in New-England 

and the middle states; and occurs in the mountainous districts, as far southward as South-

Carolina, or perhaps even Georgia. It is one of the stateliest trees of the forest; scarcely less 

distinguished by the beauty of its foliage, than by the durability of its wood.  By repeated analyses, 

conducted with the minutest attention to every circumstance which could ensure accuracy, it 

appears, incredible as it may seem, that the chesnut _wood_ contains twice as much tannin as 

ross'd[45] _oak bark_, and six-sevenths as much colouring matter (which gives a black with iron,) 

as logwood. I am aware that nothing could be farther
