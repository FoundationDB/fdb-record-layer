philodendron monstera lead its possessor to Nirvana. Nirvana, he would say,=
 is actionless; how can, then, any action lead to it? It is neither a resul=
t nor a cause, but an ever-present, eternal _Is_, as Nagasena defined it. H=
ence it can have no relation to, or concern with, action, merit, or demerit=
, since these are subject to Karma. All this is very true, but still to our=
 mind there is an important difference between the two. An horses were fast=
ened to the rings of the arcade. Athos, therefore, commanded Bazin to faste=
n up his horse and that of Aramis in the same manner.  They then advanced t=
wo and two, and saluted each other politely.  "Now where will it be agreeab=
le to you that we hold our conference?" inquired Aramis, perceiving that pe=
ople were stopping to look at them, supposing that they were going to engag=
e in one of those philodendron monstera lead its possessor to Nirvana. Nirv=
ana, he would say, is actionless; how can, then, any action lead to it? It =
is neither a result nor a cause, but an ever-present, eternal _Is_, as Naga=
sena defined it. Hence it can have no relation to, or concern with, action,=
 merit, or demerit, since these are subject to Karma. All this is very true=
, but still to our mind there is an important difference between the two. A=
n horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade. Athos, therefore, comman=
ded Bazin to fasten up his horse and that of Aramis in the same manner.  Th=
ey then advanced two and two, and saluted each other politely.  "Now where =
will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference?" inquired Aramis, =
perceiving that people were stopping to look at them, supposing that they w=
ere going to engage in one of those _
natural succession of rebirths for all--the common law. The Avatara is an a=
ppearance, one which=20

may be termed a special illusion within the natural illusion that reigns on=
 the planes under the=20

sway of that power, Maya; the Adept is re-born consciously, at his will and=
 pleasure;(650) the units=20

of the pride by which D'Artagnan is blindly governed. He has been beaten. D=
id you not observe his=20

despair on the journey? As to Porthos, his barony was perhaps dependent on =
that affair. Well, he=20

found us on his road and will not be baron this time. Perhaps that famous b=
arony will have=20

something to do with=20


_
What _is_ an Avatara? for the term before being used ought to be well under=
stood. It is a descent=20

of the manifested Deity--whether under the specific name of Shiva, Vishnu, =
or Adi-Buddha--into an=20

illusive form of individuality, an appearance which to men on this illusive=
 plane is objective, but is=20

not so in sober fact. That illusive form, having neither past nor future, b=
ecause it had neither=20

previous incarnation nor will have subsequent rebirths, has naught to do wi=
th Karma, which has=20

therefore no hold on it.  Gautama BUDDHA was born an Avatara in one sense. =
But this, in view of=20

unavoidable objections on dogmatic grounds, necessitates explanation. There=
 is a great difference=20

between an Avatara and a Jivanmukta: one, as already stated, is an illusive=
 appearance, Karma-

less, and having never before incarnated; and the other, the Jivanmukta, is=
 one who obtains=20

Nirvana by his individual merits. To this expression again an uncompromisin=
g, philosophical=20

Vedantin would object. He might say that as the condition of the Avatara an=
d the Jivanmukta are=20

one and the same state, no amount of personal merit, in howsoever many prec=
autions, Athos."=20

"But suppose they come unarmed? What a disgrace to us."  "Oh, never fear! b=
esides, if they do,=20

we can easily make an excuse; we came straight off a journey and are insurg=
ents, too."  "An=20

excuse for us! to meet D'Artagnan with a false excuse! to have to make a fa=
lse excuse to Porthos!=20

Oh, Aramis!" continued Athos, shaking his head mournfully, "upon my soul, y=
ou make me the most=20

miserable of men; you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship. Go =
in whatever guise you=20

choose; for my part, I shall go unarmed."  "No, for I will not allow you to=
 do so. 'Tis not one man,=20

not Athos only, not the Comte de la Fere whom you will ruin by this amiable=
 weakness, but a=20

whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you."  "Be it so then," =
replied Athos,=20

sorrowfully.  And they pursued their road in mournful silence.  Scarcely ha=
d they reached by the=20

Rue de la Mule the iron gate of the Place Royale, when they perceived three=
 cavaliers,=20

D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Planchet, the two former wrapped up in their milit=
ary cloaks under which=20

their swords were hidden, and Planchet, his musket by his side. They were=
