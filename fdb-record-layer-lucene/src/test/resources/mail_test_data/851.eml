chivalrous pity, plead for and comfort her!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COf all the b=
ad actions of Napoleon=E2=80=99s bad life,=E2=80=9D said M.=20

de Sartines with emphasis, =E2=80=9CI believe his treatment of that woman i=
s the worst.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CPerhaps so,=20

monsieur,=E2=80=9D said Ivan. =E2=80=9CStill _I_ can scarcely think it, bec=
ause I have never seen the ex-Empress,=20

while I _have_ seen the miserable remains of the gallant army which he aban=
doned so cruelly in=20

the frozen plains of Lithuania.=E2=80=9D  The next moment he was sorry for =
his words, for he caught the=20

angry glare in the eyes of Emile. Either he had not heard or he had forgott=
en that the lad was an=20

ardent admirer of Buonaparte.  =E2=80=9CThe Emperor is fallen,=E2=80=9D sai=
d Emile, =E2=80=9Ctherefore, of course, every=20

one finds a stone to fling at him. He was not faultless,--I grant it. You c=
annot expect real greatness=20

to bind itself down to the rules of a timid conventional morality. But at l=
east he was entirely free=20

from petty vanities and small affectations. You would never find _him_ layi=
ng himself out to gain=20

the cheap praise of a magnanimous conqueror from the lips of the vulgar.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9C_Never_, indeed,=E2=80=9D=20

assented Madame de Talmont.  =E2=80=9CTrue, undoubtedly,=E2=80=9D said M. d=
e Sartines.  No one noticed=20

St=C3=A9phanie=E2=80=99s aside: =E2=80=9CI see; _very_ clever people need n=
ot care about being good. I shall tell my=20

governess that.=E2=80=9D  But every one looked at Ivan. For a moment he gre=
w perfectly white with anger;=20

then his face resumed its natural colour, and a smile played about his lips=
. He said nothing,=20

however, and Emile went on: =E2=80=9CConsequently he never overshot the mar=
k and made himself=20

ridiculous, as I must say the Emperor Alexander did the other day, when he =
actually admitted to=20

his own table, and spent hours in conversation with--whom do you think, lad=
ies?=E2=80=9D  As neither=20

Madame de Talmont nor Cl=C3=A9mence replied, St=C3=A9phanie felt herself ca=
lled upon. =E2=80=9CPerhaps the=20

Director of the Ecole Polytechnique, or--could it possibly have been one of=
 the boys?--_students_,=20

I beg your pardon,=E2=80=9D said she with a saucy glance at Emile.  =E2=80=
=9CMy dear child,=E2=80=9D said her father in a=20

grieved and reproving aside, =E2=80=9Cdo not, I pray thee, try to act _l=E2=
=80=99enfant terrible_.=E2=80=9D  Emile did not=20

condescend to notice her, =E2=80=9CNo one greater,=E2=80=9D he resumed, =E2=
=80=9Cthan the Abb=C3=A9 Sicard.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWho is he?=E2=80=9D=20

asked M. de Sartines.  Madame de Talmont and Cl=C3=A9mence knew very well, =
and looked interested.=20

=E2=80=9CAn old fool of a priest who spends his life picking up deaf and du=
mb children out of the streets,=20

and teaching them to read and to say their prayers,=E2=80=9D replied Emile.=
  =E2=80=9CHow can they say their=20

prayers if they are dumb?=E2=80=9D queried St=C3=A9phanie.  =E2=80=9CThey s=
peak with their fingers, dear,=E2=80=9D Cl=C3=A9mence=20



explained in a lower tone. =E2=80=9CI will tell you all about it another ti=
me. I have seen a poor boy examined=20

who was taught by the Abb=C3=A9 Sicard. It was wonderful and beautiful. He =
knew far more than many=20

a child who could hear, and he _felt_ what he knew.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHis =
Imperial Majesty,=E2=80=9D Emile was saying=20

meanwhile, =E2=80=9Cwho has all the affairs of the world on his shoulders, =
and can scarcely find time to be=20

commonly courteous to the fair ladies who adore him, found time enough to h=
ear all the =E2=80=98methods,=E2=80=99=20

as they call them, of this fanatical priest; and has given him the Order of=
 St. Ladislaus, or St.=20

Laocoon, or something.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe Order of St. Wladamir, you me=
an,=E2=80=9D said Ivan very quietly. =E2=80=9CWhen=20

the Czar returns home, he will probably establish a school for the deaf and=
 dumb in St.=20

Petersburg, like that of the Abb=C3=A9 Sicard here.[54] I thank you for tel=
ling us all this, M. Emile. Do=20

you take liqueur? I can recommend this cura=C3=A7oa.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCur=
se his effrontery!=E2=80=9D thought Emile. =E2=80=9CWill=20

nothing disconcert him? I will take another way with him, however.=E2=80=9D=
  After the party rose from=20

table, the De Talmonts had a short walk to the place where the carriage was=
 to meet them; and=20

their friends accompanied them. M. de Sartines gave his arm to Madame de Ta=
lmont, and=20

St=C3=A9phanie clung to Cl=C3=A9mence, so that Emile and Ivan were obliged =
to bring up the rear together,=20

not greatly to the satisfaction of the latter. To the former, however, it w=
as a precious and longed-

for opportunity.  =E2=80=9CM. de Sartines is a very well-bred sort of man,=
=E2=80=9D he explained to Ivan,--=E2=80=9Cthough I,=20

of course, am not fond of Legitimists and believers in =E2=80=98divine righ=
t.=E2=80=99 It may be four or five years now=20

since he gave offence, in some way or other, to Savary, the late superinten=
dent of police, and was=20

requested to quit the Empire. He has just come back in the train of Louis D=
ix-huit, with a great=20

many more who are less wanted.--Peste! the whole city is full of these whit=
e cockades; one would=20

think there was snow in May time.--I suppose that by this time _you_ know a=
ll the family affairs, M.=20

Posharky, and they have told you that long ago, before he left Paris, M. de=
 Sartines was betrothed=20

to my cousin Cl=C3=A9mence.=E2=80=9D  Ivan=E2=80=99s sudden, irrepressible =
start, and the deadly paleness that=20

overspread his face, gave the keenest gratification to Emile. =E2=80=9CBut =
he is so old, he might be her=20

father,=E2=80=9D he said at last.  =E2=80=9CThat does not matter in the lea=
st,=E2=80=9D returned the spiteful Emile. =E2=80=9CHe is an=20

excellent _parti_--has a good property, settled principles, and all that. D=
o you not see how devoted=20

Cl=C3=A9mence is to that amiable and precocious young lady, Mademoiselle St=
=C3=A9phanie? She will make=20

an admirable step-mother; though I cannot say I envy her the charge.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CBut, at the time you say it=20

was arranged, Mademoiselle Cl=C3=A9mence must have been only a child.=E2=80=
=9D  Emile looked at him keenly.=20

=E2=80=9CI fear your wound is sometimes painful, even yet,=E2=80=9D he said=
.  =E2=80=9CYes, it hurts occasionally.--Is it then=20

your custom here to betroth children?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is the custom f=
or parents to arrange all these little=20

matters as they think best, and sometimes they arrange them very early. Mad=
ame de Talmont,=20

though she looks so gentle, is a woman of most decided will, quite capable =
of settling the destinies=20

of all belonging to her. Ah, here is the carriage! I am glad I have made yo=
ur acquaintance, M.=20

Posharky, and I thank you for a very pleasant day.=E2=80=9D  Ivan could not=
 certainly return the compliment.=20

The homeward drive was rather silent; only a few remarks passed between Mad=
ame de Talmont=20

and her daughter. Ivan looked, and was, exceedingly tired. Madame de Talmon=
t observed this,=20

and kindly, even tenderly, expressed a hope that the fatigues of the day ha=
d not been too much for=20

him; nor did the eyes of Cl=C3=A9mence fail to express her concern, though =
her lips were silent.  But all=20

the time his resolve was taking shape and strengthening. Emile=E2=80=99s ti=
dings, while they touched him=20

to the quick, had also revealed him to himself. His path lay straight befor=
e him now; he could do no=20

less than    =E2=80=9CPut his fortune to the touch,   And gain or lose it a=
ll.=E2=80=9D  But the gain was so=20



inconceivably precious, the loss so unutterably terrible! A brave man may h=
ave the courage to risk=20

his all; yet he knows the extent of the risk, and it is no disgrace to him =
if his heart trembles. That=20

evening Ivan=E2=80=99s heart trembled sorely; nay, it almost sank within hi=
m.  But a powerful ally was at=20

hand. The door was opened for the returning party by a young soldier in und=
ress uniform. There=20

was a startled cry, an instant=E2=80=99s hesitation, and in another moment =
Madame de Talmont was=20

weeping in the arms of her son, and Cl=C3=A9mence standing beside them with=
 a radiant face. Ivan=20

silently sought his lonely chamber; =E2=80=9Cfor,=E2=80=9D said he, =E2=80=
=9Cthis joy is one in which a stranger may not=20

intermeddle.=E2=80=9D  An hour later Henri bounded up the stairs, and knock=
ed at his door. =E2=80=9CSupper is=20

ready,=E2=80=9D he said; =E2=80=9Ccome, my friend, and join us.=E2=80=9D As=
 they went down together he added, =E2=80=9CIt is one=20

joy the more for me to find _you_ here, M. Pojarsky.=E2=80=9D  While the ha=
ppy family party sat together=20

over the repast--almost as unable now to eat for joy as they had been for s=
orrow on the evening of=20

Henri=E2=80=99s departure--their talk strayed lightly over the surface of t=
he eventful histories that had yet to=20

be told and heard.  =E2=80=9CI must congratulate you upon your recovery, M.=
 de Talmont,=E2=80=9D said Ivan.--=E2=80=9CIf=20

you had seen him in the hospital at Vilna, madame,=E2=80=9D he added, turni=
ng to Madame de Talmont,=20

=E2=80=9Cyou would rejoice and wonder at the change.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh,=
 that well-remembered visit of yours!=E2=80=9D returned=20

Henri. =E2=80=9CIn every way it was a happy one for me. Do you know it has =
saved me a tedious and=20

fruitless journey to Brie, and a long delay in finding my mother and sister=
?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHow could that be?=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CI arrived in Paris last night, very late. This morning I chanced t=
o see a young Russian gentleman=20

in a uniform like yours; so I accosted him, and asked for news of you.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHow did you know my=20

name?=E2=80=9D  Henri smiled. =E2=80=9CNaturally I wished to know to whom I=
 was indebted for so much kindness.=20

So that day, after you left the hospital, I asked those about me, and easil=
y found out who you=20

were. Your comrade in the Chevalier Guard, whom I met this morning, informe=
d me that you had=20

been wounded, and were now at Versailles. Shall I tell you what he said bes=
ides?=E2=80=9D he added with=20

a comical air of hesitation. =E2=80=9CJust this--=E2=80=98He is a fortunate=
 lad, born under a lucky star, and always=20

sure to fall upon his feet. At present he is the guest of a perfectly charm=
ing family of the old=20

noblesse, named De Talmont.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CO Henri!=E2=80=9D c=
ried the half-blushing, half-laughing Cl=C3=A9mence. =E2=80=9CI fear=20

your residence abroad has not advanced you in the grace of modesty.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CI shall punish you for that=20

speech by deepening your blushes, sister mine,=E2=80=9D returned Henri, lau=
ghing merrily. =E2=80=9CFor my=20

informant, M. Tolstoi, was good enough to add, =E2=80=98There are two elder=
 ladies of the most perfect=20

grace and breeding; and a demoiselle with a face beautiful as the Madonna=
=E2=80=99s, and no doubt a soul=20

that answers to her face.=E2=80=99 Of course after that I hastened to infor=
m him that the young lady was my=20

sister, and to beg for the address. So here I am.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut wh=
y did you not write to us during all this=20

long weary time?=E2=80=9D asked his mother. =E2=80=9CWhy did you allow us t=
o fear, nay, to believe the worst?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=20

_did_ write, dearest mother, from Vilna, no less than four times; and you c=
an imagine how I longed=20

for one word in reply, and how my heart sank as days and weeks and months p=
assed in silence.=20

Of course I sent all my letters to Brie.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen the lazy, =
dishonest, incompetent postmaster of Brie=20

ought to be ignominiously dismissed from his office, as no doubt he would h=
ave been under the=20

old r=C3=A9gime,=E2=80=9D said Madame de Salgues, breaking silence almost f=
or the first time. That night she=20

was taking, gladly and contentedly, the place of an interested spectator of=
 the drama of life, in=20

which her own part had been played long ago. If in the thankful little hous=
ehold there still was one=20

anxious and desponding heart, it was that of Ivan--=E2=80=9Cthe young heart=
