ve start followed by a=20

twitching of the tail led me to suppose that sudden death had succeeded the=
 shot; but, knowing=20

the peculiar tenacity of life possessed by the crocodile, I fired another s=
hot at the shoulder, as the=20

huge body lay so close to the river's edge that the slightest struggle woul=
d cause it to disappear.=20

To my surprise, this shot, far from producing a quietus, gave rise to a ser=
ies of extraordinary=20

convulsive struggles. One moment it rolled upon its back, lashed out right =
and left with its tail, and=20

ended by toppling over into the river.  This was too much for the excitable=
 Bacheet, who, followed=20

by his friend, Wat Gamma, with more courage than discretion, rushed into th=
e river, and=20

endeavoured to catch the crocodile by the tail. Before I had time to call t=
hem back, these two Arab=20

water-dogs were up to their necks in the river, screaming out directions to=
 each other while they=20

were feeling for the body of the monster with their feet. At length I succe=
eded in calling them to=20

shore, and we almost immediately saw the body of the crocodile appear belly=
 upwards, about fifty=20

yards down the stream; the forepaws were above the water, but, after rollin=
g round several times,=20

it once more disappeared, rapidly carried away by the muddy torrent. This w=
as quite enough for=20

the Arabs, who had been watching the event from the opposite bank of the ri=
ver, and the report=20

quickly spread that two crocodiles were killed, one of which they declared =
to be the public enemy=20

that had taken the men at the ferry, but upon what evidence I cannot unders=
tand. Although my=20

Arabs looked forward to a dinner of crocodile flesh, I was obliged to searc=
h for something of rather=20

milder flavour for ourselves. I waited for about an hour while the first cr=
ocodile was being divided,=20

when I took a shot gun and succeeded in killing three geese and a species o=
f antelope no larger=20

than a hare, known by the Arabs as the Dik-dik (Nanotragus Hemprichianus). =
This little creature=20

inhabits thick bush. Since my return to England, I have seen a good specime=
n in the Zoological=20

Gardens of the Regent's Park.  Upon my arrival at the tents, I found the ca=
mp redolent of musk=20

from the flesh of the crocodile, and the people were quarrelling for the mu=
sk glands, which they=20

had extracted, and which are much prized by the Arab women, who of your sor=
rows, is the habit of=20

mental introspection. Man is born to observe, but if he falls into psycholo=
gy he observes nothing,=20

and then he is astonished that life has no charms for him, or that, never s=
eizing the occasion, his=20

career is a failure. No, sir, it is the eye that must be occupied and culti=
vated; no one knows the=20

capacity of the eye who has not developed it, or the visions of beauty and =
delight and=20

inexhaustible interest which it commands. To a man who observes, life is as=
 different as the=20

existence of a dreaming psychologist is to that of the animals of the field=

g psychologist.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou are young=20

and not irremediably lost,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus. =E2=80=9CFortunately,=
 you have received the admirable=20

though partial education of your class. You are a good shot, you can ride, =
you can row, you can=20

swim. That imperfect secretion of the brain which is called thought has not=
 yet bowed your frame.=20

You have not had time to read much. Give it up altogether. The conversation=
 of a woman like=20

Theodora is worth all the libraries in the world. If it were only for her s=
ake, I should wish to save=20

you, but I wish to do it for your own. Yes, profit by the vast though calam=
itous experience which=20

you have gained in a short time. We may know a great deal about our bodies,=
 we can know very=20

little about our minds.=E2=80=9D  The =E2=80=9Creal English lords=E2=80=9D =
turned out to be Bertram and St. Aldegonde,=20

returning from Nubia. They had left England about the same time as Lothair,=
 and had paired=20

together on the Irish Church till Easter, with a sort of secret hope on the=
 part of St. Aldegonde that=20



they might neither of them reappear in the House of Commons again until the=
 Irish Church were=20

either saved or subverted. Holy Week had long passed, and they were at Jeru=
salem, not quite so=20

near the House of Commons as the Reform Club or the Carlton, but still St. =
Aldegonde had=20

mentioned that he was beginning to be bored with Jerusalem, and Bertram cou=
nted on their=20

immediate departure when they accepted the invitation to dine with the Russ=
ian consul.  Lothair=20

was unaffectedly delighted to meet Bertram, and glad to see St. Aldegonde, =
but he was a little=20

nervous and embarrassed as to the probable tone of his reception by them. B=
ut their manner=20

relieved him in an instant, for he saw they knew nothing of his adventures.=

necklace.  A crocodile possesses four of such glands; they vary in size acc=
ording to the age of the=20

reptile, but they are generally about as large as a hazel-nut, when dried. =
Two glands are situated=20

in the groin, and two in the throat, a little in advance of the fore-legs. =
I have noticed two species of=20

crocodiles throughout all the rivers of Abyssinia, and in the White Nile. O=
ne of these is of a dark=20

brown colour, and much shorter and thicker in proportion than the other, wh=
ich grows to an=20

immense length, an is generally of a pale greenish yellow. Throughout the A=
tbara, crocodiles are=20

extremely mischievous and bold; this can be accounted for by the constant p=
resence of Arabs and=20

their flocks, which the crocodiles have ceased to fear, as they exact a hea=
vy tribute in their=20

frequent passages of the river. The Arabs assert that the dark-coloured, th=
ick-bodied species is=20

more to be dreaded than the other.  The common belief that the scales of th=
e crocodile will stop a=20

bullet is very erroneous. If a rifle is loaded with the moderate charge of =
two and a half drachms it=20

will throw an ounce ball through the scales of the hardest portion of the b=
ack; but were the scales=20

struck obliquely, the bullet might possibly glance from the surface, as in =
like manner it would=20

ricochet from the surface of water. The crocodile is so difficult to kill o=
utright, that people are apt to=20

imagine that the scales have resisted their bullets. The only shots that wi=
ll produce instant death=20

are those that strike the brain or the spine through the neck. A shot throu=
gh the shoulder is fatal;=20

but as the body immediately sinks, and since we last met? I wish you had co=
me with us, and had a=20

shot at a crocodile.=E2=80=9D  Bertram told Lothair in the course of the ev=
ening that he found letters at Cairo=20

from Corisande, on his return, in which there was a good deal about Lothair=
, and which had made=20

him rather uneasy. =E2=80=9CThat there was a rumor you had been badly wound=
ed, and some other=20

things,=E2=80=9D and Bertram looked him full in the face; =E2=80=9Cbut I da=
re say not a word of truth.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI was never=20

better in my life,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand I have been in Sicil=
y and in Greece. However, we will talk over=20

all this another time.=E2=80=9D  The dinner at the consulate was one of the=
 most successful banquets that=20

was ever given, if to please your guests be the test of good fortune in suc=
h enterprises. St.=20

Aldegonde was perfectly charmed with the Phoebus family; he did not know wh=
ich to admire=20

most=E2=80=94the great artist, who was in remarkable spirits to-day, consid=
ering he was in a Semitic=20

country, or his radiant wife, or his brilliant sister-in-law. St. Aldegonde=
 took an early opportunity of=20

informing Bertram that if he liked to go over and vote for the Irish Church=
 he would release him=20

from his pair with the greatest pleasure, but for his part he had not the s=
lightest intention of leaving=20

Jerusalem at present. Strange to say, Bertram received this intimation with=
out a murmur. He was=20

not so loud in his admiration of the Phoebus family as St. Aldegonde, but t=
here is a silent=20

sentiment sometimes more expressive than the noisiest applause, and more da=
ngerous. Bertram=20

had sat next to Euphrosyne, and was entirely spell-bound.  The consul=E2=80=
=99s wife, a hostess not=20

unworthy of such=20

distended the carcase, the game is generally carried away by the stream bef=
ore it has had time to=20

float. The body of a crocodile requires from twelve to eighteen hours befor=
e it will rise to the=20

surface, while that of the hippopotamus will never remain longer than two h=
ours beneath the=20

water, and will generally rise in an hour and a half after death. This diff=
erence in time depends=20

upon the depth and temperature; in deep entertained her friends in the Euro=
pean style. The=20

dinner-hour was not late, and the gentlemen who attended the ladies from th=
e dinner-table were=20

allowed to remain some time in the saloon. Lothair talked much to the consu=
l=E2=80=99s wife, by whose side=20

sat Madame Phoebus. St. Aldegonde was always on his legs, distracted by the=
 rival attractions of=20

that lady and her husband. More remote, Bertram whispered to Euphrosyne, wh=
