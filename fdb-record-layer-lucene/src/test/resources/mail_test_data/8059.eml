philodendron monstera lays himself down there in the cave, while the wild beasts, whose haunt it may have been, prowl without, feeling himself safer among them than among the more ferocious "sons of men," whose hatred which taken separately would make a good sensation finale. There are wily mothers and desperate daughters throwing with unerring aim their nets over youths who have become reckless or imbecile. philodendron monstera lays himself down there in the cave, while the wild beasts, whose haunt it may have been, prowl without, feeling himself safer among them than among the more ferocious "sons of men," whose hatred which taken separately would make a good sensation finale.

solicitude of God in Christ. Nor can we forget that the only other instance of the figure before 

David's psalms is in the exquisite idyl which tells of the sweet heroism of David's ancestress, Ruth, 

on whose gentle and homeless head was pronounced the benediction, "A full reward be given 

thee of the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust" (Ruth ii. 12). We may 

perhaps also see in this clause an extension of the simile which unquestionably lies in the verb, 

and may think of the strong "sides of the cave," arching above the fugitive like a gigantic pair of 

wings beneath which he nestles warm and dry, while the short-lived storm roars among the rocks--

a type of that broad pinion which is his true defence till threatening evils be overpast. In the past 

he has sheltered his soul in God, but no past act of faith can avail for present distresses. It must 

be perpetually renewed. The past deliverances should make the present confidence more easy; 

and the true use of all earlier exercises of trust is to prepare for the resolve that we will still rely on 

the help we have so often proved. "I have trusted in Thee" should ever be followed by "And in the 

shadow of Thy wings will I trust."  The psalmist goes on to fulfil his resolve. He takes refuge by 

prayer in God, whose absolute elevation above all creatures and circumstances is the ground of 

his hope, whose faithful might will accomplish its design, and complete His servant's lot. "I will call 

to God Most High; to God who perfects (His purpose) for me." And then assured hope gleams 

upon his soul, and though the storm-clouds hang low and black as ever, they are touched with 

light. "He will send from heaven and save me." But even while this happy certainty dawns upon 

him, the contending fears, which ever lurk hard by faith, reassert their power, and burst in, 

breaking the flow of the sentence, which by its harsh construction indicates the sudden irruption of 

disturbing thoughts. "He that would swallow me up reproaches (me)." With this two-worded cry of 

pain--prolonged by the very unusual occurrence, in the middle of a verse, of the "Selah," which is 

probably a musical direction for the accompaniment--a billow of terror breaks over his soul; but its 

force is soon spent, and the hope, above which for a moment it had rolled, rises from the broken 

spray like some pillared light round which the surges dash in vain. "God shall send forth His mercy 

and His truth"--those two white-robed messengers who draw nigh to all who call on Him. Then 

follows in broken words, the true rendering of which is matter of considerable doubt, a renewed 

picture of his danger:    (4) (With) through mine.  "Why is it," asked Broadhem, "that men are not 

yet at all conscious of possessing this spiritual agency?"  "Why is it, ask you?"--and the clear 

solemn voice of my new companion startled Broadhem, who had not seen him join me, so that I 

felt his arm tremble upon mine. "Ask rather why sects are fierce and intolerant; why worship is 

formal and irreverent; why zealots run to fierce frenzies and react to atheistic chills; why piety is 

constrained and lifeless, like antique pictures painted by the old Byzantines upon a golden ground; 

why Puseyism tries to whip piety to life with scourges, and starve out sin with fasts; why the altar is 

made a stage where Ritualists delight a gaping crowd, and the pulpit a place where the sleek 

official drones away the sleepy hour; why religious books are the dullest; why the clergyman is 

looked upon by the millions as a barrel-organ, whom the sect turns like the wandering Savoyard, 

unable to evolve a free-born note. There is but one answer----" and he stopped abruptly.  "What is 

it?" I said, timidly, for I was overwhelmed by the torrent of his eloquence.  "We have lost our God! 

That is why men are unconscious of His force within them. It is a terrible thing for a nation to lose 

its God. History shows that all nations wherein the religious inspiration has gone down beneath 

formalism, infidelity, a warlike spirit, an enslaving spirit, or a trading spirit, have burst like so many 



gilded bubbles, most enlarged and gorgeous at the moment of their close. Think of the old 

Scripture, 'The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.'"  "Who is 

that?" whispered Broadhem. "I never saw him before."  "I want to be alone with him," I replied. 

"Good night, Broadhem. You had better go back now, or you will find your friends gone. Think over 

what I have said. Once realise the '_mystery_ of godliness,' and the martyrdom which it must 

entail will lose its terrors."  "Let him sacrifice us if He will," said he who had before spoken. "The 

true man is but a cannon-shot, rejoicing most of all when the Divine Artillerist shall send him 

irresistible and flaming against some foeman of the race risen from Pandemonium. Man--the true 

man--is like the Parthian's arrow, kindling into fiery flames as it leaves the bow. Man--the true 

man--is the Spirit-sword, but the sword-arm is moved by the heart of the Almighty."  Ah Piccadilly! 

hallowed recollections may attach to those stones worn by the feet of the busy idiots in this vast 

asylum, for one sane man has trodden them, and I listened to the words of wisdom as they 

dropped from the lips of one so obscure that his name is still unknown 


_
Devourers are the sons of men;       Their teeth a spear and arrows,       And their tongue a sharp 

sword  The psalmist seems to have broken off the construction, and instead of finishing the 

sentence as he began it, to have substituted the first person for the third, which ought to have 

followed "my soul." This fragmentary construction expresses agitation of spirit. It may be a 

question whether the "lions" in the first clause are to be regarded as a description of his enemies, 

who are but I doubted not who at that moment was the greatest man in Piccadilly.  [Illustration] 

CONCLUSION.  MORAL.       PICCADILLY, _July 15_.  It will be seen by the date at which I am 

writing this, that I have been compelled to increase the pace I have been keeping up during the 

season. The fact is, my episode, like those of my neighbours, seems likely to be prematurely 

concluded by the course of political events, which will no doubt act prejudicially this year upon the 

happiness of many

sons of men who devour (or who "breathe out fire"), and whose words are cutting and wounding 

as spear and sword. The analogy of the other psalms of this period favours such an understanding 

of the words. But, on the other hand, the reference preferred by Delitzsch and others gives great 

beauty. According to that interpretation, the fugitive among the savage cliffs prepares himself for 

his members of society. Towards the close of the London season it is only natural that everything 

should culminate; but generally the actors in the scenes of real life so calculate that the curtain 

falls just at the right moment; or rather, that they shall be doing just the right thing when the curtain 

falls. The artists insensibly group themselves for the _grand tableau_. All over the stage
