philodendron monstera shore and I was asked to go. I had just come off sent=
ry and was dressed for shore. We all met up forward, hailed a police boat, =
climbed down a rope ladder across two barges unloading shells and into the =
police launch. When I got in I found that I and one other fellow were the o=
nly privates; all the rest were sergeants and corporals, thirteen altogethe=
r, unlucky number. The police motion, is not likely to be frozen over at an=
y time. But if all endeavours to discover a passage to the Pacific by eithe=

ved every doubt on this subject by ascertaining the fact. In making the att=

 important to science will present themselves to the observation of those w=
ho are _
attention was continually necessary. The trip has been so long that we are =
now beginning to hate=20

each other. I went down in the stoke-hole and the engine-room. Even amongst=
 the whirling=20

machines it was more peaceful than in our quarters. It seems months since I=
 was in Montreal last.=20

-------------------------------------  Dear Old England in sight!  We're pa=
ssing the Lizard now.  The kit=20

has all been inspected and we hope to land to-morrow some time.  We're lyin=
g in the historic=20

harbor of Plymouth; arrived here about two hours ago. We're surrounded by f=
ast little torpedo-boat=20

destroyers, which are chasing round us all the time like dogs loosened from=
 a chain. The=20

breakwater has searchlights mounted on each end and fixed lights are playin=
g from the shore. As=20

the lights occasionally flash up the ships in the bay, it is as bright as d=
ay. Nobody is allowed=20

ashore, not even the officers. We may go on to Southampton, only we must ge=
t there before five=20

at night. After that time nothing is allowed in.                    -------=
------------------------------  Sailed at=20

daybreak on to Devonport. Most of the transports are now lying in pairs at =
anchor in the harbor.=20

We're close to the shore. We can see naval "jolly boats" and pinnaces saili=
ng back and forth. On=20

one side are lying the H.M.S Powerful and another boat, both of which in th=
eir day were the pride=20

of the Navy. The Powerful was the boat which made such a name for herself i=
n the Boer War. Now=20

both of these vessels are training ships and obsolete so far as this war go=
es.  All our haversacks=20

have been boiled in coffee to stain them khaki.  One of the Navy steam laun=
ches came by and we=20

asked them to get us newspapers. They came back with a bundle and we nearly=
 had a riot trying=20

to get at them.  It was only to-day that we heard of the fall of Antwerp, t=
he atrocities of Belgium,=20

and the treachery of Maritz in Cape Colony.  We shall be getting off in a f=
ew hours and this may be=20

the last I shall write for some time. I have put in a great deal of time du=
ring the voyage writing and=20

have done so under difficulties. Sometimes the cabin has been torn in piece=
s, and often=20

arguments, carried on by leather-lunged opponents of "Kultur," have made th=
is work hard.  We=20

hear that some paper published an account of the sinking of twenty of the s=
hips. This rumor is=20

false, and it's a beastly thing for the newspaper to do, but you must remem=
ber to discount all news=20

a great deal.  Still on board and we shall probably be here for a few days =
more. My, it's galling to=20

be so near to the land and yet to be cooped up in our crowded quarters. Cro=
wded launches and=20

steamers are sailing round the liners. All day long cheering crowds come ou=
t to see us. Last night=20

another liner called Florizel, with the First Regiment Newfoundland troops,=
 tied up to us. They=20

were a fine-looking lot of men. We told them we had no tobacco; they threw =
dozens of tins of their=20

tobacco and cigarettes over to us. We fought for them. I got the remains of=
 one tin with most of the=20

contents spilt. Still, as many of us haven't as indelicate, or arrogant, bu=
t simply a matter of justice=20

to the interests of American science, and particularly to Mr. Hare.    BENJ=
AMIN SILLIMAN,=20

_Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy in Yale College._     ART. XXV. _The=
 Northwest=20

Passage, the North Pole, and the Greenland Ice._   In looking over the fore=
ign journals, we find no=20

articles of intelligence so interesting as those which respect the three su=
bjects mentioned above.=20

Indeed, as they have found their way into most of our newspapers, it is now=
 generally known in=20

this country, that, in consequence of the reported breaking up of the Green=
land ice, an expedition=20

has already left England, in two divisions, the one for the purpose of expl=
oring a northwest=20

passage to Asia, around the North American continent, by the way of Davis's=
 Straits; the other, for=20

effecting the same object _by passing over the north pole_.  If Horace thou=
ght that man almost=20

impiously daring who first adventured upon the open sea, what shall we say =
of the hardihood of=20



the attempt to visit THE POLE?--the pole, which it is impossible to contemp=
late without awe--

which, in all probability, has never been visited by any living being--wher=
e the dreary solitude has=20

never been broken by human voice--where the sound of war has never been hea=
rd, and darkness=20

and cold exert an almost undisputed dominion! What must be the emotions of =
that man who first=20

stands upon the point of the earth's axis! Who, no longer partaking of the =
revolution, in circles of=20

latitude, slowly revolves on the axis of his own body, once in twenty-four =
hours--to whom the sun=20

does not rise or set, but, moving in a course very oblique to the horizon, =
makes scarcely a=20

perceptible progress in twenty-four hours, and at the end of three months, =
when he has attained=20

his noon, is only 23=C2=B0 28, on the arc of a vertical circle, above the h=
orizon--to whom longitude is=20

extinct, and who can move in no possible direction but south--to whom the s=
tars are a blank, and=20

to whom the polar star, could he see it, would appear in the zenith. Such a=
re some of the most=20

obvious results of a position on the pole. The man who first establishes hi=
mself on this sublime=20

point, will have more reason for self-congratulation than he who led the Pe=
rsian myriads into=20

Greece, or he who pushed the Macedonians to the Indus.  On these interestin=
g subjects, we beg=20

leave to refer our readers to a very able treatise in the Quarterly Review =
for February, 1818, where=20

all the topics at the head of this article are discussed with much learning=
 and ability.--We extract=20

the following passage:  "If an open navigation should be discovered across =
the polar basin, the=20

passage over the pole or close to it, will be one of the most interesting e=
vents to science that has=20

ever occurred. It will be the first time that the problem was practically s=
olved with which the=20

learners of geography are sometimes puzzled--that of going the shortest way=
 between two places=20

lying east and west, by taking a direction of north and south. The passage =
of the pole will require=20

the undivided attention of the=20


_
appreciated it. Several cruisers have come in to-day, and there seem to be =
dozens of submarines=20

and torpedo boats cruising around all day. The reason we did not go to Sout=
hampton is that five=20

German submarines were waiting for us.  The transports are unloading at the=
 rate of five or six=20

ships a day. It will probably be our turn on Sunday. The fleet looks splend=
id at night now that we=20

have most of the lights on. All night the steel riveters are at work on thr=
ee battleships that are=20

being built close by. Near us are several "wooden walls." One is a ship of =
Nelson's, the Queen=20

Adelaide. Every boat, tug, lighter and motor boat here is the property of t=
he Admiralty.=20

-------------------------------------  We are probably going to Salisbury P=
lain for two months. We are the=20

first Expeditionary Force to land in England from the dominions or colonies=
, but others are on their=20

way. The sailors from the training ships serenade us in boats with bands an=
d play "O Canada,"=20

"The Maple Leaf Forever," and all day long on one ship or the other we hear=
 "It's a Long Way to=20

Tipperary." Every one is singing it; without doubt it is _the_ song of the =
war. To-day we got a=20

bundle of papers. We read them right through to the advertisements. Cigaret=
tes and matches are=20

at a premium and food is running out on board. The strain of staying here i=
s this point, from which=20

the northern coasts of Europe, Asia, and America, and every part of them, w=
ill bear _south_ of=20

him, nothing can possibly assist him in determining his course, and keeping=
 on the right meridian=20

of his destined place, but a correct knowledge of the _time_: and yet no me=
ans of ascertaining that=20

time will be afforded him. The only _time_ he can have, with any degree of =
certainty, as long as he=20

remains on or near the pole, must be that of Greenwich, and this he can kno=
w only from good=20

chronometers; for, from the general hazy state of the atmosphere, and parti=
cularly about the=20

horizon, and the sameness in the altitude of the sun at every hour in the f=
our-and-twenty, he must=20

not expect to obtain an approximation even of the apparent time, by observa=
tion, and he will have=20

no stars to assist him. All his ideas respecting the heavens and the reckon=
ings of his time will be=20

reversed, and the change not gradual, as in proceeding from the east to the=
 west, or the contrary,=20

but instantaneous. The magnetic needle will point to its unknown magnetic p=
ole, or fly around from=20

the point of the bowl in which it is suspended, and that which indicated no=
rth will now be south; the=20

east will become the west, and the hour of noon will be that of midnight.  =
"These curious=20

circumstances will probably be considered to mark the passage by the=20

We're all disagreeable and insubordinate. The guard room is already full an=

lorizel with the=20

 got the tip that a bunch=20

of men were going to make a it will perhaps be found equally easy. We have,=
 indeed, very little=20

pole, it will also be free of=20
