_Patient Must Inform Physician Fully Concerning his Case=E2=80=94His Commun=
ications=20

Privileged._=E2=80=94On the other hand, as we have already stated, the pati=
ent owes the duty to his=20

physician of informing him fully of all the varied symptoms of his disease,=
 or the circumstances=20

attending his injury, and to freely and with due confidence answer all ques=
tions concerning his=20

past history which would tend to throw any light upon his present condition=
. To battle with the=20

occult forces which play so important a part in determining the course or c=
onsequences of=20

disease, it is absolutely essential that the physician should know all that=
 is possible to be known of=20

the patient=E2=80=99s history, and of the history of the patient=E2=80=99s =
family. As we shall see later on, all such=20

communications are, in most of the States of the Union and elsewhere, by st=
atutory enactment=20

made privileged, and without the consent of the patient the physician or su=
rgeon is absolutely=20

forbidden to divulge any communication or information which he receives in =
order to enable him to=20

prescribe. This rule applies equally whether the physician or surgeon is ac=
ting for hire or is treating=20

the person as a charity patient, and it has been extended by construction b=
y the courts in some=20

States, so as to include examinations made by jail physicians or other phys=
icians sent by the=20

prosecuting officials of the State to examine a prisoner, for purpose of gi=
ving evidence, but who=20

allowed the prisoner to suppose that they were there simply to treat him in=

advice to commit a crime, and of any information received by the physicians=
 while the persons=20



asking for it were engaged in a criminal attempt. All of these interesting =
questions will be examined=20

and treated of at length hereafter.[166]  _Conditions of Contract Between P=
