and wrote.     "My dearest, above all created things I love you. Morning has come,    and it seems 

to me that I have travelled far since last I saw you.    I have come to a new place, which is neither 

hell nor heaven, and in    the mystery of it you--you alone are real. It is to your strength    that I 

cling, and I know that you will not fail me.     "Since I saw you, Hugh, I have been through the 

Valley of the    Shadow. I have thought of many things. One truth alone is clear--    that I love you 

transcendently.. You have touched and awakened me    into life. I walk in a world unknown. 

"There is the glory of martyrdom in this message I send you now.    You must not come to me 

again until I send for you. I cannot, I    will not trust myself or you. I will keep this love which has 

come    to me undefiled. It has brought with it to me a new spirit, a    spirit with a scorn for things 

base and mean. Though it were my    last chance in life, I would not see you if you came. If I 

thought    you would not understand what I feel, I could not love you as I do.     "I will write to you 

again, when I see my way more clearly. I told    you in the garden before you spoke that I was 

going away. Do not    seek to know my plans. For the sake of the years to come, obey me. 

"HONORA."  She reread the letter, and sealed it. A new and different exaltation had come to her--

begotten, perhaps, in the act of writing. A new courage filled her, and now she contemplated the 

ordeal with a tranquillity that surprised her. The disorder and chaos of the night were passed, and 

she welcomed the coming day, and those that were to follow it. As his. She led him down the 

stairs, and Jeremiah, hearing the sound of his own footsteps, did not wonder that he did not hear 

hers. It would have been difficult, she trod so softly, and she had taken off her boots. She 

accompanied him like a spirit: not the only one which walked beside and before him. By his blood! 

By his life! Miser Farebrother's words. Well, it might come to that. What other road of escape was 

left open?  In the kitchen below, Mrs. Pamflett put her forefinger to her lips.  "Speak low, Jeremiah. 

I listened outside, and heard all. He has the heart of a devil! That is his gratitude for faithful 

service. His life has been in my hands for years past. I could have sent him to his grave and no 

one the wiser. I am your cat-mother, am I? And he will fling us into the gutter, and laugh at us? He 

and his daughter are a pair. He has had the best years of our lives, and he spits in our faces. Have 

you told me the whole truth, Jeremiah? About the books and the safe--is there anything against 

you there? Can he get you into further trouble?"  "Mother," said Jeremiah, "if he calls in an 

accountant, as he threatens to do, I am lost. There is no hope of escape for me. If I don't get back 

that bracelet, I am lost. And he has money, too, here, hidden away, and not a soul knows it but 

him and ourselves."  "Not a soul, Jeremiah."  "No one comes to the house but us?"  "Not a person 

has been here for a month past."  "But--attend to me, mother--there comes here to-night, late, a 

man to see Miser Farebrother. It might be!"  "It might be," his mother echoed, gazing at her son 

with a fierce expectancy in her eyes.  "This man has been here frequently

fates were inclined to humour her impatience, there was a telegram on her breakfast tray, dated at 

New York, and informing her that her husband would be in Newport about the middle of the 

afternoon. His western trip was finished a day earlier than he expected. Honora rang her bell. 

"Mathilde, I am going away."  "Oui, madame."  "And I should like you to go with me."  "Oui, 

madame."  "It is only coming once in every six or seven weeks, and Miser Farebrother expects 

and receives him. They talk in secret in Miser Farebrother's room, with the door locked. You are 

never admitted. You are sent to bed, and sometimes you have awoke in the middle of the night, 

and have heard sounds in the miser's room, which proved that the man was still there. You never 

knew at what hour he went away, but it
