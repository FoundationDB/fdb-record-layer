o  When I got my balance,=20

and was able to look out, the train had gone so far that Diana and Lisa had=
 been swept away from=20

my sight. It was like a bad omen; and the fear was cold upon me that I had =
lost my love for ever.=20

At that moment I suffered so atrociously that if it had not been too late, =
I fear I should have=20

sacrificed Maxine and the Foreign Secretary and even the _Entente Cordiale_=
 (provided he had=20

not been exaggerating) for Di's sake, and love's sake. But there was no goi=
ng back now, even if I=20

would. The train was already travelling almost at full speed, and there was=
 nothing to do but resign=20

myself to the inevitable, and hope for the best. Someone, it was clear, had=
 tried to work mischief=20

between Diana and me, and there were only too many chances that he had succ=
eeded. Could it=20

be Bob West, I asked myself, as I half-dazedly looked for a place to sit do=
wn among the litter of=20

small luggage with which the first occupant of the carriage had strewn ever=
y seat. I knew that Bob=20

was as much in love with Di as a man of his rather unintellectual, unimagin=
ative type could be, and=20

he hadn't shown himself as friendly lately to me as he once had: still, I d=
idn't think he was the sort=20

of fellow to trip up a rival in the race by a trick, even if he could possi=
bly have found out that I was=20

going to Paris this morning.  "Won't you sit here, sir?" a voice broke into=
 my thoughts, and I saw=20

that the little man had cleared a place for me next his own, which was in a=
 corner facing the=20

engine. Thanking him absent-mindedly, I sat down, and began to observe my t=
ravelling=20

companions for the first time.  So far, their faces had been mere blurs for=
 me: but now it struck me=20

that all three were rather peculiar; that is, peculiar when seen in a first=
-class carriage.  The man=20
