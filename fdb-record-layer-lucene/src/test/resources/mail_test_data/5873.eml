In 1721 the "Upper Inhabitants" of Richmond County because of their great d=
istance from the=20

courthouse petitioned to become a separate county. The eastern part lying b=
elow "Charles Beaver=20

Dams and from the head thereof by a north course to Westmoreland County" wa=

name Richmond and the part above the said dams and course was to be King Ge=
orge County.=20

New Kent and the part=20

lying in St. Paul's Parish was to be known as Hanover County. The name agai=
n honors the=20

reigning monarch.  Also in 1721, a third new county was formed and called S=
potsylvania for the=20

energetic and capable Governor. Spotsylvania was taken from Essex, and part=
