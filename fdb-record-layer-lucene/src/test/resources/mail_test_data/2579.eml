s at the rear of the=20

procession to keep order, or the girls would have succumbed to some of thes=
e temptations and=20

have broken rank, an unpardonable offense in the eyes of the school authori=
ties, who wished to=20

keep up the prestige of their establishment in the estimation of the town, =
and to emulate the=20

convent school on the hill, whose pupils marched along the high street as d=
emurely as young=20

nuns.  Turning out of the piazza they walked alongside a deep natural gorge=
 which divided=20

Fossato from the open country. This immense ravine was a fearsome place, wi=
th a sheer descent=20

of many hundreds of feet; its jagged rocks were clothed with bushes and cre=
epers, and clefts and=20

the openings of caves could be seen amongst the greenery. The girls leaned =
on the low wall and=20

shuddered as they gazed down the precipice.  "Antonio and Dominica say that=
 dwarfs live in the=20

caves down there," remarked Peachy. "Half the people in the town believe in=
 them, but they're too=20

afraid to go and see because the dwarfs have 'the evil eye,' and would brin=
g them bad luck."=20

"What superstitious nonsense!" laughed Rachel. "How _can_ they make up such=
 stuff?"  "Not=20

altogether such nonsense as you think," corrected Miss Bickford, who was a =
student of=20

archaeology; "indeed _I_ find it intensely interesting. It's a case of surv=
ival of tradition. A few=20

thousand years ago no doubt a race of little short dark Stone Age men actua=
lly lived in those=20

caves, and took good care to banks of the lake. The plain, then thinly inha=
bited, was filled with=20

brushwood, interspersed with trunks of scattered trees and parasite plants,=
 enveloped with a thick=20

sward, less capable of emitting radiant caloric than the soil that is culti=
vated and consequently not=20

sheltered from the rays of the sun. With the destruction of the trees, and =
the increase of the=20

cultivation of sugar, indigo, and cotton, the springs, and all the natural =
supplies of the lake of=20

Valencia, have diminished from year to year. It is difficult to form a just=
 idea of the enormous=20

quantity of evaporation which takes place under the torrid zone, in a valle=
y surrounded with steep=20

declivities, where a regular breeze and descending currents of air are felt=
 towards evening, and=20

the bottom of which is flat, and looks as if levelled by the waters. It has=
 been remarked, that the=20

heat which prevails throughout the year at Cura, Guacara, Nueva Valencia, a=
nd on the borders of=20

the lake, is the same as that felt at midsummer in Naples and Sicily. The m=
ean annual=20

temperature of the valleys of Aragua is nearly 25.5 degrees; my hygrometric=
al observations of the=20

month of February, taking the mean of day and night, gave 71.4 degrees of t=
he hair hygrometer.=20

As the words great drought and great humidity have no determinate significa=
tion, and air that=20

would be called very dry in the lower regions of the tropics would be regar=
ded as humid in Europe,=20

we can judge of these relations between climates only by comparing spots si=

 of their territory. The=20

remembrance of them would be handed down long after they had become extinct=
, and, of course=20

their doings were exaggerated, and their cunning tricks were set down to ma=
gic. Just as the=20

prehistoric monsters lingered as dragons and firedrakes, so the small early=
 inhabitants of Europe=20

have passed into dwarfs and brownies and pixies. If anybody cared to dig in=
 those caves I dare=20

say flint weapons might be found. It's a does not rain during a whole year,=
 and where I had the=20

means of collecting a great number of hygrometric observations made at diff=
erent hours of the day=20

and night, the mean humidity of the air is 86 degrees; corresponding to the=
 mean temperature of=20

27.7 degrees. Taking into account the influence of the rainy months, that i=

and that of the whole year; an annual mean humidity is obtained, for the=20

if they'd only take it."  Leaving the gorge the party turned up a steep and=
 very narrow alley=20

between walls nine or ten feet high. At the tops of these walls were raised=
 gardens planted with=20

orange and lemon trees, whose fruit, in all stages of green, gold, and yell=
ow, overshadowed the=20

path. Across some of them were erected shelters of reeds or plaited grass, =
to prevent too quick=20

ripening, but in some of the orchards the crop was ready, and workers were =
busy with ladders and=20

baskets gathering their early harvests. It was a picturesque route, for at =
farthest of 74 degrees, the=20

temperature being 25.5 degrees. In this air, so hot, and at the same time s=
o little humid, the=20

quantity of water evaporated is enormous. The theory of Dalton estimates, u=
nder the conditions=20

just stated, for the thickness of the sheet of water evaporated in an hour'=

lines in twenty-four hours. Assuming for the temperate zone, for instance a=
t Paris, the mean=20

temperature to be 10.6 degrees, and the mean humidity 82 degrees, we find, =
according to the=20

same formulae, 0.10 mill., an hour, and 1=20
