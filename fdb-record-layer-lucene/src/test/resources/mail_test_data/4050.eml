-an, and in answer to=20

their invitation that he should come to them, and their profession that the=
ir lives were at his=20

service, he asked them to pledge themselves to defend him as they would the=
ir own wives and=20

children. And a murmur of eager assent rolled round about from the seventy,=
 and an old man, one=20

of their chiefs, stood forth and said, 'Stretch out thy hand, O Mohammad.' =
And the chief with=20

delight. His fear and trembling all left him.  =E2=80=9CSpeak, Young Black =
Buck!=E2=80=9D shouted his father. =E2=80=9CDid=20

answer. =E2=80=9CYes, he stood in my way,=E2=80=9D he replied, =E2=80=9Cand=
 when I reached the edge he bit at me, and=20

tried to push me off the edge.=E2=80=9D  White Tail started in surprise and=
 horror at this accusation, for he=20

was too stunned to speak. Then, when he realized what the charge meant,=20


_

s fealty. Man after=20

man the others followed, and struck their hands upon Mohammad's. Then he ch=

them as leaders over the rest, saying, 'Moses chose from among his people t=
welve leaders. Ye=20

shall be the sureties for the rest, even as the apostles of Jesus were; and=
 I am the surety for my=20

people.' A voice of some stranger was heard near by, and the assembly hasti=
ly dispersed and=20

stole back to their camp. This is the second pledge of the 'Akabeh.  The Ku=
reysh knew that some=20

meeting had taken place, and though they could not bring home the offence t=
o any of the Yethrib=20

pilgrims, they kept a stricter watch on the movements of Mohammad and his f=
riends after the=20

pilgrims had returned homeward. It was clear that Mekka was no longer a saf=
e place for the=20

Muslims, and a few said:  =E2=80=9CYou know I didn=E2=80=99t do that, Young=
 Black Buck! If I hadn=E2=80=99t grabbed your=20

antlers you would have fallen over and been crushed to death. Oh, how could=

 believed that White Tail had=20

actually tried to push his rival down the chasm, and others were equally ce=
rtain that the son of=20

Father Buck could never be guilty of such a crime. The commotion was approa=
ching the=20

proportions of a riot when Father Buck brought silence with a roar of autho=
rity.  =E2=80=9CBe quiet!=E2=80=9D he=20

bellowed. =E2=80=9CWe must settle this dispute right. If my son was guilty =

second pledge Mohammad told his followers to betake themselves secretly to =
Yethrib. For two=20

months at the beginning of the eleventh year of the mission (622) the Musli=
ms were leaving Mekka=20

in small companies to make the journey of 250 miles to Yethrib. One hundred=
 families had gone,=20

and whole quarters of the city were deserted, left with empty houses and lo=
cked doors, 'a prey to=20

woe and wind.' There were but three believers now remaining in Mekka--these=
 were Mohammad,=20

Aboo-Bekr, and 'Alee. Like the captain of a sinking ship, the Prophet would=
 not leave till all the=20

crew were safe. But now they were all gone save his two early friends, and =
everything him from=20

the herd in disgrace. But if he is innocent, I will back him up with all my=
 might.=E2=80=9D  He turned fiercely=20

on Black Buck, as he said this, his eyes flashing and his antlers bobbing t=
hreateningly. Black Buck=20

was not anxious to get in a fight with the leader, and he backed away grumb=
ling.  =E2=80=9CI will protect my=20

son, too,=E2=80=9D he breathed angrily, =E2=80=9Cif he is right.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CThat is your duty,=E2=80=9D roared Father Buck, =E2=80=9Cand it is=

your duty to denounce him if he=E2=80=99s in the wrong. Will you do that al=
so?=E2=80=9D  Black Buck made some=20

inaudible reply, and backed still further away from the flashing eyes.  =E2=

ch taken by surprise to=20

prevent the emigration, now prepared measures for a summary vengeance on th=
e disturber of=20

their peace and the emptier of their city. They set a watch on his house, a=
nd, it is said,=20

commissioned a band of armed youths of different families to  A dozen or mo=

in the affirmative. Without changing the expression of his face, Father Buc=

  An equal number of voices=20

responded promptly. To make sure Father Buck counted them, and then counted=
 those who had=20

answered in favor of=20

Mohammad had warning of his danger, and leaving 'Alee to deceive the enemy,=
 he was concealed=20

with Aboo-Bekr in a narrow-mouthed cave on Mount Thor, an hour-and-a-half's=
 journey from=20

Mekka, before the Black Buck. They were the same! Twenty yeas and twenty no=
es!  =E2=80=9CThat makes=20

must decide then one way or the other himself. In this case it=E2=80=99s do=
