in the course of events. Is he entitled to a square deal? Most assuredly so, especially if he is 

employed at honest work and his every action shows determination to lead an upright life. He has 

sinned against society, it is true, but without question he has paid the debt of his transgression a 

hundred fold by his imprisonment. Still, after all has been said, a bad reputation is a difficult thing 

to live down, even that which clings to the free citizen. The discharged prisoner's chief reliance, 

therefore, in the final analysis is to so circumspectly conduct himself as to place him above the 

carping criticisms of his new associates. If he follows this course his neighbors are not likely to 

keep their eyes on his "cracked" reputation.                     [Cell Door Decorative Illustration] 

DEPARTMENTS AND INDUSTRIES OF THE MINNESOTA STATE PRISON                           THE 

ADMINISTRATION BUILDING.   The administration building is directly under the charge of 

Warden Wolfer. He has the power to appoint all subordinate officers and employes and discharge 

them for inefficiency and insubordination. As chief executive officer of the prison, under the 

supervision of the State Board of Control, the warden is directly responsible for its successful 

management, the humane treatment and reformation of the inmates placed in his care for safe 

keeping.  Warden Wolfer is one of the best prison men in this country and the enviable reputation 

Minnesota's penitentiary has attained is due entirely to his long and successful experience in 

handling criminals. He has headed the Stillwater institution for nearly twenty years and has 

conducted the affairs of the prison in a sane and business-like manner. Under his unceasing 

vigilance the institution has emerged from a non-paying to a profit-earning enterprise, and today it 

is one of the best self-supporting institutions in the world, for, in our opinion, Europe has nothing 

that can compare with it. Mr. Wolfer has received many flattering offers from other states to take 

charge of their penal institutions, but he has declined, preferring to remain at the head of the 

institution that he has worked so faithfully to perfect.  The position of warden of the Minnesota 

state prison is no sinecure, for that presiding officer is one of the busiest men in the state. The 

business connected with the twine plant, conducted almost entirely on a mail-order basis, is 

colossal in itself, there being nearly fifteen million pounds to be disposed of each year. In addition 

to this important item the task of maintaining peace and harmony among the officers, guards, 

employes and the (at present) seven hundred prisoners assumes monumental proportions. 

However, Mr. Wolfer has succeeded in performing this gigantic labor for all concerned year in and 

year out with rare tact and good judgment.  For comparative purposes, the expenses ten years 

ago, with a population of 504 prisoners, exceeded the earnings by $35,285.04, whereas the 

earnings for 1906-7 were $329,735.70, a remarkable showing indeed and speaking well for the 

executive ability of the present management.  Warden Wolfer is an excellent type of the successful 

self-made man. From a guard in his youth at the Joliet (Ill.) penitentiary and later in charge of the 

Detroit House of Correction, he was enabled to accept the wardenship of the Stillwater, 

Minnesota, institution.  There are several assistants employed in the executive department, where 

the method of conducting the business of the prison is thoroughly systematized and the 

organization is as nearly perfect as possible. The warden is at all times in touch with every detail 

of the institution and all correspondence of the prison, of whatsoever nature, passes through his 

hands for final disposition. He makes a trip each day through the various departments, morning 

and afternoon, to personally ascertain that everything is in proper order. This watchfulness 

produces good results; for instance, a short time ago he found a guard in the act of assaulting a 



prisoner and immediately discharged him. Again, he overheard a guard using extremely abusive 

language toward a prisoner and reduced his salary in consequence. As all such offenses are 

posted on a bulletin board the Year round, as an ingenious Lady has told me. It is also to be 

remark'd, that ripe Goosberries make very fine Tarts.  The beginning of this Month, when the 

Goosberries are full grown, but not ripe, is the right Season for preserving of them in sweet-meat: 

The white _Dutch_ Goosberry is the best for this use.  So likewise if you have plenty of _Kentish_ 

Cherries, pick some of them from the Stalks, and lay the Cherries upon a fine Wire Sieve, and dry 

them in an Oven; when they are dried enough, and quite cold, put them in an Earthen glazed Jar, 

and stop them up close: These must be kept in a dry place.  Upon the foot of the above Receipt, 

for preserving of Fruits, I have a Notion that we may preserve green Pease, after the same 

manner, in Bottles, that I have mention'd for the preserving of Goosberries, Currants, _&c._ So 

that they will eat tender and well tasted at _Christmas:_ it is well worth the tryal, seeing that a 

Bottle or two cannot be any great Expence, and that Pease are acceptable almost to every one. 

This I have persuaded some of my Acquaintance to try, but particularly a very curious Person in 

such matters, who tells me, that provided this method answers what we aim at, he supposes they 

will be the most agreeable, either to be boiled with Cream, or stew'd in Gravey, after the _French_ 

manner, for it is a dispute with him, whether they will hold their green Colour; but, as I observ'd 

before, it may be try'd at an easy Expence.  The beginning of this Month is the time to pickle 

Walnuts, for then the Walnuts have not began to shell, and moreover are not so bitter nor hollow 

as they will be afterwards; they will now be full flesh'd, and you will have no Loss. The following 

Method I learnt from Mr. _Foord,_ a curious Gentleman of _Buckingham,_ and has been 

experienced to be the best way. There is one thing indeed which must be regarded in this Pickle, 

which is, that every one does not love the Taste of Onion or Garlick; but that may be omitted as 

we please, only supplying the place with Ginger.    To pickle Walnuts.  The Walnuts being fit for 

pickling, wash them, and put them into a Kettle to scald; then with a piece of Flannel rub off the 

outer Skin, and let them lie till they are quite cold, after which put them into a Vessel of Salt and 

Water, and let them stand 24 Hours; then take them out, and put them again into fresh Salt and 

Water for 24 Hours more; then shift them as before, and continue this Practice for fourteen Days, 

at the end of which time wipe them dry, and lay them in a glazed earthen Pot, _Stratum super 

Stratum,_ with Spice, whole Mustard-Seed, Horse-Radish slic'd, and Garlick, or Eschalots: that is 

to say, make a Layer of Walnuts, and strew over it whole Pepper, Ginger slic'd, Horse-Radish 

slic'd, some whole Mustard-Seed, and three or four Cloves of Garlick; or if Garlick be too strong, 

as many Cloves of Shalots. Then lay upon these another Layer of Walnuts, and upon them the 

Roots and Spices as before, and so continue till your Pot is full; then pour over the whole, as much 

boiling Vinegar as will cover them, and immediately cover the Pot close, and let it stand till the next 

Day, when we may again pour off the Vinegar from them, without disturbing them; and making it 

again boiling hot, pour it upon them, and stop them close, as before, to be set by for use. But 

these will not be fit for eating under three Weeks or a Month, and will be much better by keeping a 

few Months.  This Month is a proper time to make Syrup of Clove-Julyflowers, and likewise to 

make Julyflower Wine, which is a very rich Liquor, and may be made in the best manner, by the 

following Receipt from Mrs. B. B.    To make Julyflower Wine.  Take nine Gallons of Water, and 

twenty four Pounds of Sugar, boil these on a gentle Fire till one Gallon is lost, or evaporated, 



taking off the Scum as it rises. Then having prepared a Bushel of Clove Julyflowers, the red 

Flower Leaves only, pour the Liquor scalding hot upon them, and cover them close till the next 

Day, then pressing them with a Screw-press. When this is done, bake a piece of Bread hard, 

without scorching, before the Fire, and while it is warm, spread some Ale-Yeast upon it, and put it 

into the Liquor, in an open Tub, till

outside of the warden's office and in the corridor leading into the prison the officers and guards are 

careful in their treatment of inmates under their charge.            [Horace W. Davis, Chief Clerk and

[Convicts During Sunday Drill ]                         Convicts During Sunday Drill   Minnesota should 

rightly feel proud of her penal institution, and especially of Warden Wolfer, who has advanced the 

prison to the high standard of efficiency it occupies in the ranks of modern penology. 

The Deputy Warden's Headquarters   The deputy warden ranks next to the warden in the 

administration duties of Minnesota's penal institution; in fact, he is the warden's right-hand man in 

conducting the disciplinary affairs of the institution. Much depends upon his efficiency in promoting 

harmony and goodwill among the prisoners.  The deputy warden's office is located on the ground 

floor of the hospital building, and it is here that all the statistical records of incoming prisoners are 

preserved, such as the Bertillon measurements, finger-print system, etc.  The duties of the deputy 

warden are many and arduous. Mr. Backland has had many years experience as a prison man 

and is very popular among the officers, guards and employees. He is always courteous to guards 

and prisoners alike. The following are the duties governing the deputy warden:   Duties of the 

Deputy Warden      1. The Deputy Warden is the assistant and agent of the Warden in the 

government and management of the inmates of the prison--more       particularly in securing 

compliance after which, add two quarts of Sack, and one of _Rhenish_ Wine, and barrel it for 

three Weeks or a Month; let it then be bottled, and kept in a cool Place.  In this Month such Carp 

and Tench are good as have not lately spawn'd; the dressing of them, and of Pikes, or Jacks, see 

in _March_. Perch are now very good, the large ones for stewing, as recommended for Carp, or 

boiled or fry'd, or else in the _Dutch_ manner, call'd Water Soochy; which is to boil the Perches 

with Salt in the Water, and Parsley-Roots and Parsley Leaves, to be brought to Table in the Water 

they are boiled in, and eaten with Bread and Butter. 'Tis an odd way to the _English_, but is much 

admir'd by many Genlemen who have travell'd.  The Garden is now very rich in Eatables, as may 

be seen in my _Gardener's Kalendar_, printed for Mr. _Mears_.  The Trasopogon, or Goatsbeard, 

is now, as well as in the former Month, fit for boiling; it is in much request in some of the Western 

parts of _England_, especially about _Bristol_, as I am inform'd, where the Country People call it 

Trangompoop, or Crangompoop, a corruption, as I suppose, from the true Name above written: 

This is eaten like Asparagus, and dress'd the same way, the part which is eaten is the blossomy 

Bud a little before it would flower, with about six Inches of the Stalk to it.  There are now Chickens, 

Pigeons, Ducks, and some young wild Ducks, and Rabbets, which may not only make great 

Variety at a Table, to be drest after the common plain way, but may also be made into elgant 

Dishes, after the several manners mention'd in this Work, if there is an occasion to entertain 

particular People of fine Taste.  The Ronceval and Mooretto Pease, and _Windsor_ Beans, are 

also good helps to a Table: I need say nothing of their dressing; but that I am of opinion,

subordinate officers, employees and inmates.    2. He shall be present daily at the prison from the 

hour of unlocking       in the morning until after the inmates shall have been locked up at       night, 

unless leave of absence has been granted by the Warden, and       he shall visit the prison 

occasionally at night, and personally       ascertain that the enough till we can take off their Skins, 

and then put into large-neck'd Bottles, and order'd as I have prescrib'd for the preserving of Pease; 

by this means I suppose they may be preserv'd many Months: but we may defer this Experiment 

till the end of _September_, to be try'd upon the latter Crops.  Near the Sea we have Mackrel in 

the height of perfection, and 


_
duty and alert.    3. In the absence of the Warden, the Deputy shall perform the duty of       that 

office relating to the government and management of the inmates       of the prison. His orders 

shall be respected and obeyed by       subordinate officers, guards, employees and inmates, so far 

as       relates to discipline and carrying out such rules and orders of the       Board of Control as 

are not otherwise delegated.    4. Under the order of the Warden, the Deputy Warden shall have 

special       control and direction of all officers under his own rank, and all       guards and 

employees of the prison, and shall be responsible that       everyone performs his respective duties 

Turbut, Herrings, Scate, and Soles, as also Lobsters and Crabs; and in the Rivers, Salmon and 

Trout are still good, and some Cray-Fish.  'Tis now a proper Season to put up Rasp-berries, either 

in Sweetmeat, or to infuse in Brandy; but they must be gather'd dry. There are certain People who 

know how to mix these with _Port_ Wine, and imitate the richest _Florence_ Wine.  About 

_Midsummer_ is a proper time to put up a Boar for Brawn against _Christmas_, or against the 

beginning of _December_, for then is the Season it sells best, and is chiefly in request, selling at 

that time for twelve Pence _per_ Pound.  For this end we should chuse an old Boar, for the older 

he is, the more horny will
