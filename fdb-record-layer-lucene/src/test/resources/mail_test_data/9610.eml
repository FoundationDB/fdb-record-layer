business for three weeks. His success varied, but he never made less than seventy-five cents a 

day, and sometimes as much as a dollar and a quarter. He was not without competitors. More 

than once, on reaching his accustomed stand, he found a rival occupying it before him. In such 

cases he quietly passed on, and set up his business elsewhere, preferring to monopolize the 

trade, though the location might not be so good.  Teddy O'Brien did not again enter the field. We 

left him, at the end of the last chapter, trying to escape from Mike and Jim, who demanded a larger 

sum than he was willing to pay for their services. He succeeded in escaping with turning of the 

wheel of time, and gives me a sense of gratification difficult of expression.  Edward W. Bok

him, and Teddy received a black eye as a receipt in full of all demands. So, on the whole, he 

decided that some other business would suit him better, and resumed the blacking-box, which he 

had abandoned on embarking in commercial pursuits.  Mike Donovan and Jim Parker were two 

notoriously bad boys, preferring to make a living in any other way than by honest industry. As 

some of these ways were not regarded as honest in the sight of the law, each had more than once 

been sentenced to a term at Blackwell's Island. They made a proposition to Paul to act as decoy

Teddy. He liked neither of the boys, and did not care to be associated with them. This refusal Mike 

and Jim resented, and determined to "pay off" Paul if they ever got a chance. Our hero from time 

to time saw them hovering about him, but took very little notice of them.  He knew that he was a 

match for either, though Mike exceeded him in size, and he felt quite capable of taking care of 

himself.  One day Mike and Jim, whose kindred tastes led them to     war time experiences, 168-
