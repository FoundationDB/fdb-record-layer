Psalmist exclaim, =E2=80=98Tu solus es scrutans renes et corda!=E2=80=99  =
=E2=80=98It is notorious, that my late lord founded=20

many masses and private chapels, doing much service to the church: let then=
 his last will, so=20

devoutly written, be considered with what I have before said, and any one m=
ay decide whether he=20

was an idolater or sorcerer. It is true, indeed, that the advocate for our =
adversary refers to the=20

judgment of God all that respects divine high treason, saying that he will =
not make this an especial=20

charge against the late duke of Orleans.  =E2=80=98But I now ask why he thu=
s acts? Because he knows the=20

charge is groundless, and that in many places human judges may and do punis=
h sorcerers and=20

idolaters according to their power; and that numbers have for these crimes =
been condemned to=20

death, because they were bad Christians, and that from such errors of the f=
aith proceed heresies.=20

It is written in the second book of Kings, that Josias killed and extirpate=
d diviners and sorcerers;=20

and in the tenth chapter of Zacharias, =E2=80=98Divini viderunt mendacium e=
t somniatores locuti sunt=20

frustra.=E2=80=99 It is also written in the nineteenth chapter of Leviticus=
, =E2=80=98Ne declinetis ad magos, nec ab=20

ariolis aliquid sciscitemini.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98The reason why the advocat=
e passed so rapidly over this charge was,=20

that he knew nothing against my lord of Orleans that could prove him a bad =
Christian, or that he=20

was not firm in his belief of religion. O, lord king! my lady of Orleans su=
pplicates thee, that the=20

words of Job, in the twenty-second chapter, may be verified,=E2=80=94=E2=80=
=98Salvabitur innocens in munditia=20

manuum suarum.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98The second accusation was, That my lord o=
f Orleans favoured the schism in=20

the church, by affording aid to Pietro della Luna, formerly called Pope Ben=
edict, and was=20

consequently guilty of high treason in the second degree. In reply, I say, =
that my lord of Orleans=20

gave no aid nor showed any favour, but with the laudable end of making an h=
onourable peace in=20

the church, and particularly when he considered Benedict as the true pope. =
It is well known, that=20

our obedience to the church would have been brought about more to our honou=
r if Pietro della=20

Luna had done his duty, by yielding up his claims, for the union of the chu=
rch, than by violently=20

supporting them. My lord of Orleans may have said, it will be better to wai=
t a imperfect manner in=20

which the cuts in the clothes are made in imputed wounds, the clothes being=
 off the body at the=20

time. The case occurred in Nottingham in 1872, the accused being charged wi=
th wounding the=20

plaintiff on the highway by stabbing him in the arm, though there was no ro=
bbery or other motive=20

for the act. The coat and shirt sleeve were found cut, but there was no cor=
responding cut in the=20

lining of the coat sleeve. The charge was clearly false, and was trumped up=
 by the youth who was=20

the plaintiff because he wished to leave the place where he had been sent f=
or private study.  In=20

examining a case where the self-inflicted nature of imputed wounds is in qu=
estion, the following=20

are some of the many points to keep in mind in the examination and to be as=
certained by the=20

examination: (1) The relative position of the plaintiff and the assailant a=
t the time of the alleged=20

attack. This can be compared with the position as stated by the plaintiff o=
r other witnesses. (2) The=20

situation, direction, depth, nature, and number of the wounds. (3) The situ=
ation and direction of=20

blood-marks or wounds on the dress or person of either or both. (4) The mar=
ks of blood and the=20

quantity of it at the spot of the alleged struggle. (5) The signs of a stru=
ggle and the various other=20

points of circumstantial evidence gone over in considering suicidal and hom=
icidal wounds.=20

Though a severe blow may cause a slight mark, it does not follow that a sli=
ght mark implies a=20

severe injury, else the exception is made the rule. The inconsistency of th=
e story of the plaintiff is=20



generally so palpable that imposture is evident, but prejudice and unjust s=
uspicion are often=20

excited against those accused. Thus Taylor[652] states that =E2=80=9Ca stro=
ng suspicion was raised against=20

the then Duke of Cumberland, in 1810, in reference to the death of Sellis, =
when a skilful=20

examination of the wounds on the deceased would have shown that they might =
have been self-

inflicted.=E2=80=9D The same author also cites the case of M. Armand, a mer=
chant of Montpelier, who at Aix=20

in March, 1864, was tried for an alleged murderous assault on, or imputed m=
urderous=20

strangulation of, his servant. The excoriation on the back of the neck was =
so slight as to escape=20

the observation of some medical men, and it was evidently self-inflicted, e=
ither accidentally or=20

purposely, as the facts showed. The assertions of a number of medical men w=
ere taken by the=20

court to support the servant=E2=80=99s story to the effect that his master =
had struck=20


_
than by hurrying make affairs worse. In this there could not be any evil in=
tentions; for it is a fact,=20

that he was anxious for the union of the church, and believed firmly that P=
ietro della Luna was=20

willing to abdicate his claims, whenever the roman pontiff should be ready =
to do the same.  =E2=80=98Many=20

are now living who have heard the duke swear, that if he knew Pietro della =
Luna was unwilling to=20

yield up his pretensions, when the other pope should resign his, he would b=
e the bitterest enemy=20

he had in the world; and should it be thought necessary, they are ready to =
prove it. Now let us=20

consider what advantage the division of the church could be of to him. He w=
as wise enough to see=20

all the evils him a severe blow on the back of his neck, rendering him inse=
nsible for many hours=20

from concussion of the brain. The evidence given chiefly by Tardieu for the=
 defence showed the=20

story of the complainant to be a fabrication, and the accused was justly ac=
quitted.   WAS A=20

WOUND ACCIDENTAL?  In answering this question we must distinguish accidenta=
l wounds from=20

those self-inflicted and those inflicted by another. These three classes co=
mprise all wounds. In=20

case of a trial for murder it may be alleged by the defence that the wound =
was caused by accident=20

or that it was due to suicide from a fall, falls being a common class of ac=
cidental wounds. So we=20

have to judge between accident on the one hand=20


_
it, and not so weak as to found confidence on a man so old as Pietro della =
Luna. He knew,=20

besides, that by the union of the church more spiritual and temporal advant=
ages would fall to the=20

share of himself and friends, without comparison, than if the schism were c=
ontinued.  =E2=80=98To show=20

more evidently the earnest desire my lord of Orleans had for an union of th=
e church, I will mention=20

a proposal which he made to the university of Paris three weeks before his =
death. When he=20

perceived that the roman pontiff would neither come to Genoa nor Savoy, nor=
 accept as hostages=20

those who had been presented to him by the mareschal de Boucicaut, and that=
 nothing else=20

prevented the union of the church, for Pietro della Luna was ready to go to=
 either of these places,=20

he addressed the following speech to the especially in cases where the inju=
ry causing death is one=20

commonly due to accident.  As to the QUESTION BETWEEN ACCIDENTAL AND SUICID=
AL=20

WOUNDS, they are often easily distinguished, especially if the body has not=
 been disturbed. In=20

suicide there is clear evidence of design, and the circumstantial evidence =
helps to make the case=20

clear. It may not always be possible to decide, however, as an accidental w=
ound may sometimes=20

resemble a suicidal or homicidal one. Accident is often shown by the _natur=
e_ of the wound. Thus=20

it is rare for an accidental mortal wound to be caused by a knife or simila=
r weapon held in the hand=20

and forced into the body by a fall, the blow of an opening door, etc. But s=
uch exceptional cases=20

have been reported. Incised and punctured wounds are, therefore, very rarel=
y=20


_
rector, and you all my good friends! see I pray ye that we may shortly, thr=
ough the grace of God,=20

restore peace to the church, and may give satisfactory security, that the r=
oman pope may come to=20

Genoa. I have offered him the choice of one of my sons, as his hostage, and=
 am ready to send=20

him, at my own expense, to Venice, or elsewhere. Write, therefore, such let=
ters as you shall think=20

proper to him, and I will sign them. Tell what I have said to the whole uni=
versity, and bring me their=20

opinions on it.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98The heads of the university thanked him =
very warmly for his offer,=E2=80=94adding, that=20

he could not make a more generous proposal, and that he had demonstrated by=
 it the affection he=20

bore to the church. There are contused wounds or contusions.  Again, accide=
nt is often shown by=20

the _situation_ of the wound, which should be on an exposed part of the bod=
y unless the accident=20

is due to a fall from a height, when the wound may be almost anywhere. But =
such injuries are=20

easily shown to be due to falls. The fall, of course, may be accidental, su=
icidal, or homicidal. Some=20

wounds in exposed parts forbid accident on account of their nature, _i.e._,=
 deep incised wounds of=20

the throat. If the deceased has a life insurance, suicide is less probable,=
 as the insurance is not=20

paid in case of suicide. In fine, accidental wounds are distinguished from =
suicidal by=E2=80=94(1) Their=20

_nature_; accidental wounds are almost always contused,=20


_
persons still living whom he had ordered to go to Rome and Venice to give n=
otice of the offer he=20

had made. Now, my lords, could he have done more than to give his own flesh=
 and blood for an=20

hostage? And our witnesses of this act are neither weak nor ignorant person=
s, but doctors and=20

professors rarely so, only in cases of lunatics and delirious persons and w=
here suicide is=20

accomplished by a fall. (2) The situation of the wound or wounds indicates =
their origin. We have=20

already studied the situation of suicidal wounds and have also seen that ac=
cidental wounds are=20

only on exposed parts,=20


_
=E2=80=98O, duke of Burgundy! this will show to thee how false has been thy=
 accusation; and on this charge=20

thou oughtest to have been silent, knowing as thou must how anxious thou we=
rt to acquire the=20

friendship of Pietro della Luna. At the time when Pietro was in the greates=
t disgrace, thou didst=20

write and send to him to obtain bishopricks and other preferments for thy d=
ependants; and thy=20

messengers were not pages nor common persons, but the guardian of thy soul,=
 namely, thy=20

confessor, that he might a height. The evidence from the direction of wound=
s rarely applies, as this=20

is valuable only in incised and punctured wounds, which are seldom accident=
al. Both kinds of=20

wounds are usually few in number except in case of a fall from a height or =
a crush, though=20

sometimes suicidal wounds are multiple.  The evidence from weapons, if ther=
e be any, points=20

strongly to suicide. The signs of a struggle are hardly consistent with eit=
her suicide or accident.=20

The only case in which they might occur would=20
