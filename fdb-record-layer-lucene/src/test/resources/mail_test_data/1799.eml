philodendron monstera region traversed by the great railway system the viri=

tonneau was growing quite violently impatient.  "If we are both going in th=
e same direction we=20

needn't say good-by," she said hastily, giving him her hand at parting. "Le=
t it be _auf=20

wiedersehen_." Then the clang of the closing tonneau door and the outgoing =
rush of the big car=20

coincided so accurately that Blount had to spring nimbly aside to save hims=
elf from being run=20

down.     II  THE BOSS   It is a were used to the erratic ways of the dimin=
utive craft. After all, she=20

was larger than some of the vessels used by the early voyagers to America, =
some of whose craft=20

were not even provided with decks.  When the Maud was prepared for heavy we=
ather she was as=20

tight as a drum; and while the heavy seas rolled the whole length of her, n=
ot a bucketful of them=20

found its way below her deck. The only danger of taking in a dangerous sea =
was at the scuttle on=20

the forecastle, which was the usual door of=20


_
buttes, and irrigated mesas, and a still farther one from the veranda of an=
 exclusive North Shore=20

club to a private dining-room in the Inter-Mountain Hotel, whose entrance p=
ortico faces the Capitol=20

grounds in the chief city of the Sage-brush State, whose eastern windows co=
mmand a magnificent=20

view of the Lost River Range, and from whose roof, on a clear day, one may =
see the snowy peaks=20

of the Sierras notching the distant western horizon.  Allowing for the diff=
erence between Eastern=20

and Mountain time, the dinner for two in the private dining-room of the Int=
er-Mountain=20

synchronized very fairly with the threshing out of college reminiscences by=
 the two young men=20

whose apparently fortuitous meeting on the veranda of the far-away North Sh=
ore club-house one=20

of them, at least, was ascribing to the good offices of the god of chance. =
 On the guest-book of the=20

Inter-Mountain one of the men at the table in the private dining-room had r=
egistered from Chicago.=20

The name was illegible to the cursory eye, but since it was the signature o=
f a notable empire-

builder, it was sufficiently well known in all the vast region served by th=
e Transcontinental Railway=20

System. The owner of the name had finished his ice, and was sitting back to=
 clip the end from a=20

very long and very black cigar. He was a man past the cook had their quarte=
rs.  The steamer=20

when she made a dive into a sea scooped up a quantity of water, which she s=
pilled out over the=20

rails, or over the taffrail in the standing-room. The captain had therefore=
 ordered this scuttle to be=20

secured below, so that it could not be removed. Those who had occasion to g=
o below in that part=20

of the vessel were compelled to do so through the fire-room. Though Scott w=
as a bold and brave=20

fellow, and even daring when the occasion required, he was a prudent comman=
der, and never=20

took any unnecessary chances.  But not a person on board had been permitted=
 to "turn in" as the=20

thing was done in moderate weather. The sail on the upper deck required one=
 hand to stand by it=20

all the time, though he was relieved every two hours. The engineers and the=
 cook had broad=20

divans upon which they could take a nap, and the sailing-force had taken tu=
rns on the broad sofa=20

in the pilot-house. But Captain Scott had hardly closed his eyes during the=
 night.  From the time=20

the Fatime was found to be headed to the northward, the officers of the Mau=
d had lost sight of her=20

for only a couple of hours, when a bank of fog swept over the sea, just bef=
ore sundown. But at=20

eight bells her lights had been discovered. At midnight they could still be=
 seen; but the captain and=20

Morris were=20


_
large-framed and heavy, with the square, resolute face of a born master of =
circumstances. Like the=20

younger generation, he was clean shaven; hence there was no mask for the de=
eply graven lines of=20

determination about the mouth and along the angle of the ground, judging by=
 the diminished=20

clearness of the triangle of lanterns as they appeared over the stern of th=
e Maud.  The lights of a=20

vessel following another appear to the latter in this form, with the white,=
 or plain one, at the upper=20

apex of the=20
