philodendron monstera  The tariff acts of 1828 and 1832 were declared "null, void, and no law, nor binding upon this State, its officers or citizens."

Though Jackson made no further public declarations, the views which he expressed in private 

were usually not slow to reach the public ear. In a letter to a committee of the Union party in 

response to an invitation to attend a Fourth of July dinner the President intimated that force might 

properly be employed if nullification should be attempted. And to a South Carolina Congressman 

who was setting off on a trip home he said: "Tell them [the nullifiers] from me that they can talk 

and write resolutions and print threats to their hearts' content. But if one drop of blood be shed 

there in defiance of the laws of the United States, I will hang the first man of them I can get my 

hands on to the first tree I can find." When Hayne heard of this threat he expressed in Benton's 

hearing a doubt as to whether the President would really hang anybody. "I tell you, Hayne," the 

Missourian replied, "when Jackson begins to talk about hanging, they can begin to look for the 

ropes."  Meanwhile actual nullification awaited the decision of the Christmastide, 1314, she was 

adjudged innocent, and came back to her husband, "whereof there was great joy throughout 

France." She was to become Queen of France not long afterward, and then to be widowed; but 

during the rest of her life there was no blot on her good name, and no interruption in the 

affectionate relations existing between herself and her mother. As Countess of Poitiers, as Queen 

of France, and as dowager Queen and Duchess of Burgundy, she visited Mahaut frequently, 

accompanied her in journeys, and exchanged gifts with her.  The scene of the orgies indulged in 

by Blanche de la Marche and Marguerite de Bourgogne was long pointed out in Paris and became 

an object of peculiar horror--one of those places of evil association which, without our knowing 

why, always arouse a feeling of repulsion and of dread. It was in the dark old Tour de Nesle, on 

the bank of the Seine opposite the Louvre, that, said the Parisian horror-mongers, the wicked 

queens had held high revel. The legend was not only enduring, but, like

Matters were at last brought to a head by a new piece of tariff legislation which was passed in 

1832 not to appease South Carolina but to take advantage of a comfortable state of affairs that 

had arisen in the national treasury. The public lands were again selling well, and the late tariff 

years went by. Francois Villon, that great repository of the quaint beliefs of the people of the 

purlieus of the Sorbonne, tells of the great queen "who had Jean Buridan cast in the Seine in a 

sack" from the high walls of the Tour de Nesle. Brantome, in his _Dames galantes_, records the 

same

In the disaffected State events now moved rapidly. The elections of the early autumn were carried 

by the nullifiers, and the new Legislature, acting on the recommendation of Governor Hamilton, 

promptly called a state convention to consider whether the "federal compact" had been violated 

and what remedy should be adopted. The 162 delegates who gathered at Columbia on the 19th of 

November were, socially and politically, the lite of the State: Hamiltons, Haynes, Pinckneys, 

Butlers--almost all Nesle, at Paris, and lay in wait for passers-by; and those who pleased and 

suited her best, whatever class of people they might be, she had them summoned and made them 

come to her by night; and after she had had her pleasure of them she had them cast into the water 

from the top of the high tower, and had them drowned." Other historians are even more definite in 

their statements--which, nevertheless, are unfounded,--naming the queen who is said to have 

been the Parisian Messalina and to have
