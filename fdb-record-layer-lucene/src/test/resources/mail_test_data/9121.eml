A ENGSTRAND, Mrs. Alving's maid.  The action takes place at Mrs. Alving's c=
ountry house, beside one _
even Oswald might not quite unfairly be described as simply and solely his =
father's son, an object-

lesson in heredity. We cannot be said to know him, individually and intimat=
ely, as we know Helmer=20

or Stockmann, Hialmar Ekdal or Gregors Werle. Then, again, there are one or=
 two curious flaws in=20

the play. The question whether Oswald's "case" is one which actually presen=
ts itself in the medical=20

books seems to me of very trifling moment. It is typically true, even if it=
 be not true in detail. The=20

suddenness of the catastrophe may possibly be exaggerated, its premonitions=
 and even its=20

essential nature may be misdescribed. On the other hand, I conceive it prob=
able that the poet had=20

documents to found upon, which may be unknown to his critics. I have never =
taken any pains to=20

satisfy myself upon the point, which seems to me quite immaterial. There is=
 not the slightest doubt=20

that the life-history of a Captain Alving may, and often does, entail upon =
posterity consequences=20

quite as tragic as those which ensue in Oswald's case, and far more wide-sp=
reading. That being=20

so, the artistic justification of the poet's presentment of the case is cer=
tainly not dependent on its=20

absolute scientific accuracy. The flaws above alluded to are of another nat=
ure. One of them is the=20

prominence given to the fact that the Asylum is uninsured. No doubt there i=
s some symbolical=20

purport in the circumstance; but I cannot think that it is either sufficien=
tly clear or sufficiently=20

important to justify the emphasis thrown upon it at the end of the second a=
ct. Another dubious=20

point is Oswald's argument in the first act as to the expensiveness of marr=
iage as compared with=20

free union. Since the parties to free union, as he describes it, accept all=
 the responsibilities of=20

marriage, and only pretermit the ceremony, the difference of expense, one w=
ould suppose, must=20

be neither more nor less than the actual marriage fee. I have never seen th=
is remark of Oswald's=20

adequately explained, either as a matter of economic fact, or as a trait of=
 character. Another=20

blemish, of somewhat greater moment, is the inconceivable facility with whi=
ch, in the third act,=20

Manders suffers himself to be victimised by Engstrand. All these little thi=
ngs, taken together,=20

detract, as it seems to me, from the artistic completeness of the play, and=
 impair its claim to rank=20

as the poet's masterpiece. Even in prose drama, his greatest and most consu=
mmate=20

achievements were yet to come.  Must we, then, wholly dissent from Bjrnson'=
s judgment? I think=20

not. In a historical, if not in an aesthetic, sense, _Ghosts_ may well rank=
 as Ibsen's greatest work.=20

It was the play which first gave the full measure of his technical and spir=
itual originality and daring.=20

It has done far more than any other of his plays to "move boundary-posts." =
It has advanced the=20

frontiers of dramatic art and implanted new ideals, both technical and inte=
llectual, in the minds of a=20

whole their fire. But I did not much consider the sharpshooters. It was my =
duty to investigate the=20

effects of that shot. I ordered one of the pendulums to be hauled aside, an=
d, crawling out of the=20

port, walked to the side, laid down upon my chest, and examined it thorough=
ly. The hull was=20

uninjured, except for a few splinters in the wood. I walked back and crawle=
d into the turret--the=20

bullets were falling on the iron deck all about me as thick as hailstones i=
n a storm. None struck=20

me, I suppose because the vessel was moving--and at the angle, and when I w=
as lying on the=20

deck, my body made a small mark difficult to hit. We gave them two more gun=
s, and then I told the=20

men, what was true, that the _Merrimac_ could not sink us if we let her pou=
nd us for a month. The=20

men cheered; the knowledge put new life into all.  =E2=80=9CWe had more exc=
hanges, and then the=20

_Merrimac_ tried new tactics. She endeavored to ram us, to run us down. Onc=
e she struck us=20

about amidships with her iron ram. Here you see its mark. It gave us a shoc=
k, pushed us around,=20

and that was all the harm. But the movement placed our sides together. I ga=
ve her two guns,=20



which I think lodged in her side, for, from my lookout crack, I could not s=
ee that either shot=20

rebounded. Ours being the smaller vessel, and more easily handled, I had no=
 difficulty in avoiding=20

her ram. I ran around her several times, planting our shot in what seemed t=
o be the most=20

vulnerable places. In this way, reserving my fire until I got the range and=
 the mark, I planted two=20

more shots almost in the very spot I had hit when she tried to ram us. Thos=
e shots must have=20

been effective, for they were followed by a shower of bars of iron.  =E2=80=
=9CThe third weak spot was our=20

pilot-house. You see that it is built a little more than three feet above t=
he deck, of bars of iron, ten=20

by twelve inches square, built up like a log-house, bolted with very large =
bolts at the corners where=20

the bars interlock. The pilot stands upon a platform below, his head and sh=
oulders in the pilot-

house. The upper tier of bars is separated from the second by an open space=
 of an inch, through=20

which the pilot may look out at every point of the compass. The pilot-house=
, as you see, is a four-

square mass of iron, provided with no means of deflecting a ball. I expecte=
d trouble from it, and I=20

was not disappointed. Until my accident happened, as we approached the enem=
y I stood in the=20

pilot-house and gave the signals. Lieutenant Greene fired the guns, and Eng=
ineer Stimers, here,=20

revolved the turret.  =E2=80=9CI was below the deck when the corner of the =
pilot-house was first struck by a=20

shot or a shell. It either burst or was broken, and no harm was done. A sho=
rt time after I had given=20

the signal, and, with my eye close against the lookout crack, was watching =
the effect of our shot,=20

when something happened to me--my part in the fight was ended. Lieutenant G=
reene, who fought=20

the _Merrimac_ until she had no longer=20


_
playwrights. It ranks with _Hernani_ and _La Dame aux Camlias_ among the ep=
och-making plays=20

of the nineteenth century, while in point of essential originality it tower=
s above them. We cannot, I=20

think, get nearer to the truth than Georg Brandes did in the above-quoted p=
hrase from his first=20

notice of the play, describing it as not, perhaps, the poet's greatest work=
, but certainly his noblest=20

deed. In another essay, Brandes  Can it be possible that this beardless boy=
 fought one of the=20

historic battles of the world? This was the thought of every one as the mod=
est, diffident young=20

Greene was half pushed forward into the circle.  =E2=80=9CI cannot add much=
 to the Captain=E2=80=99s story,=E2=80=9D he=20

began. =E2=80=9CHe had cut out the work for us, and we had only to follow h=
is pattern. I kept the _Monitor_=20

either moving around the circle or around the enemy, and endeavored to=20


_
breach with his early--one might almost say his hereditary romanticism. He =
here becomes, at last,=20

"the most modern of the moderns." "This, I am convinced," says the Danish c=
ritic, "is his=20

imperishable glory, and will give lasting life to his works."     GHOSTS  A=

existing in Norway. It is a Captain Worden believed he had already broken t=

knew that she could not sink us, and I thought I would keep right on poundi=

would stand it. There is really nothing new to be added to Captain Worden=
=E2=80=99s account. We could=20
