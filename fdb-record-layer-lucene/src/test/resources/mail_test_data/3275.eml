alligator in a bayou, wondering why his rather flushed face should be turne=
d toward me every now=20

and then.  My heart beat a little faster as I saw him take out his watch an=
d wind it up.  "Let's go to=20

bed," he said as he pushed it back in his waistcoat pocket. My heart stoppe=
d beating altogether,=20

for a moment or two. I felt like a slave-girl in a sheik's tent, like a des=
ert-woman just sold into=20

bondage.  It was the smoky air and the highballs, I suppose, embodied in a =
law by which the state=20

solemnly armed the hand of the private citizen against any man who should a=
ttempt to make=20

himself a king. How completely Caesar's insight failed him is proved by the=
 general acquiescence=20

or apathy with which his fall was received, the subdued tone in which even =
his warm friend Marius=20

speaks of it, and the readiness with which his own soldiers and officers se=
rved under the restored=20

republic. We have nothing to do here=20


_
a little bloodshot as he turned slowly about and studied my face. Then he r=
epeated what he had=20

said before.  "_I can't!_" I told him, with a foolish surge of terror.  He =
sat quite a long time without=20

speaking. I could see the corners of the Holbein-Astronomer mouth go down. =
 "As you say," he=20

finally remarked, with a grim sort of quietness. But every bit of color had=
 gone from his face. I was=20

glad when Tokudo came in to take away the glasses.  Duncan stood up, after =
the servant had=20

gone again, and bowed to me very solemnly.  "_Oyasumi nasi_," he said with =
a stabilizing ironic=20

smile.  "What does that mean?" I asked, doing my best to smile back at him.=
  "That means 'sleep=20

well,'" explained my husband. "But Tokudo would probably translate it into =
'Condescend to enjoy=20

honorable tranquillity.'"  Instead of enjoying honorable tranquillity, ethi=
cs respecting military=20

usurpation and tyrannicide, two things which must always stand together in =
the court of morality.=20

Tyrannicide, like suicide, was the rule of the ancient world, and would hav=
e been acknowledged by=20

Caesar himself, before he grasped supreme power, as an established duty. An=
d certainly morality=20

would stretch its bounds to include anything really necessary to protect th=
e Greek and Italian=20

republics, with the treasures which they bore in them for humanity, from th=
e barbarous lust of=20

power which was always lying in wait to devour them. I have said that the s=
pirits of Cato and=20

Cicero lived and worked after their deaths. So I suspect did that of Brutus=
. The Caesars had no=20

God, no fear of public opinion at home, no general sentiment of civilized n=
ations to control their=20

tyranny. They had only the shadow of a hand=20


_
into the wee sma' hours of the night, patrolling the gloomy ramparts of my =
soul's unrest.=20

_Wednesday the Twenty-Third_   This change to the city means a new life to =
my children. But I=20

can also see it means new dangers and new influences. The simplicity of ran=
ch life has vanished.=20

And Dinkie if I mistake not, had profited by the lesson of Caesar's folly a=
nd fate. To the=20

constitutional demeanour and personal moderation of Augustus the world owes=
 an epoch of=20

grandeur of a certain kind, and an example of true dignity in the use of po=
wer. And Augustus, I=20

suspect, had studied his part=20
