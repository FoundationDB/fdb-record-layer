should God decree the destruction of Spain, it may be seen that it is because of our destruction of 

the Indies, and His justice may be made apparent."      APPENDIX I. - THE BREVISSIMA 

RELACION     PROLOGUE OF THE BISHOP DON FRAY BARTHOLOMEW DE LAS CASAS OR 

CASAUS   TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY LORD, THE PRINCE OF THE SPANISH 

STATES.   Don Philip our Lord. Most High, and Mighty Lord.     1. As divine Providence has 

ordained that in his world, for its       government, and for the common utility of the human race, 

Kingdoms       and Countries should be constituted in which are Kings almost       fathers and 

pastors, (as Homer calls them) they being consequently       the most noble, and most generous 

members of the Republics, there       neither is nor can be reasonable doubt as to the rectitude of 

their       royal hearts. If any defect, wrong, and evil is suffered, there can       be no other cause 

than that the Kings are ignorant of it; for if       such were manifested to them, they would extirpate 

them with supreme       industry and watchful diligence.  2.2. It is seemingly this that the divine 

Scriptures mean in the rapid survey we must commence with the art of inlay. This art may be in 

metal upon metal, as in damascening; stone upon stone, as in _pietra dura_; porcelain, terra-

cotta, enamel, or coloured glass, as in mosaic work; or wood upon wood, as in intarsia; which 

subsequently became marquetry. The inlays in all these techniques are cut into cubes, hexagons, 

triangles, or other forms, often of very minute size, to form broad designs, as in marble 

pavements, or surfaces of great area such as the dome of St. Mark's at Venice, the choicest home 

of mosaic work in the world. From these grandeurs to the Tunbridge ware trinket-boxes with their 

intricate patterns, or the nicely fitting lids of Scottish snuff-boxes, is a far cry, but they embody the 

same principle.  Veneering may therefore be comprehensively described as overlaying or inlaying 

one body with portions of another. A veneer may be plain, without inlay or marquetry, such as a 

plain panel of mahogany affixed or laid on to a body of oak or some other wood. But in practice it 

has been so much used as a groundwork for the art of inlay and marquetry that it is difficult to 

separate

of Solomon, qui sedet in solio iudicii, dissipat omne malum intuitu       suo: because it is thus 

assumed from the innate and peculiar virtue       of the King namely, that the knowledge alone of 

evil in his Kingdom       is absolutely sufficient that he should destroy it; and that not for       one 

moment, as far as in him lies, can he tolerate it.  3.3. As I have fifty, or more, years of experience 

in those countries, I       have therefore  There is a prevalent idea that veneer has a sinister 

meaning. The comparison has been made between solid and veneer, as though the former were 

true and the latter something false, parallel with the distinction Pope made--      Worth makes the 

man, the want of it, the fellow;     The rest is all but leather or prunello.  There is every reason why 

such a notion should be held as true. It is true of modern cabinet-work of the shoddy type, where

the injuries, losses, and misfortunes, such as it would not have       been thought could be done by 

man; such kingdoms, so many, and so       large, or to speak better, that most vast and new world 

of the       Indies, conceded and confided by God and his Church to the Kings of       Castile, that 

they should rule and govern it; that they should       convert it, and should prosper it temporally, 

and spiritually.  4.4. When some of their particular actions are made known to Your       Highness, 

it will not be possible to forbear supplicating His       Majesty with importunate insistence, that he 

should not concede nor       permit that which the tyrants have invented, pursued, and put into 

execution, calling it Conquests; which if permitted, will be       repeated; because these acts in 

themselves, done against those       pacific, humble, and mild Indian people, who offend none, are 

iniquitous, tyrannous, condemned and cursed by every natural,       divine, and human law.  5.5. 

So as not to keep criminal silence concerning the ruin of numberless       souls and bodies that 

these persons cause, I have decided to print       some, though very few, of the innumerable 

instances I have collected       in the past and can relate with truth, in order with mahogany and 

walnut and passed off as solid. But the collector is dealing with a period when veneering was an 

art adopted for sound decorative and technical reasons and not solely for purposes of gain.  The 

old craftsman found it impossible to make cabinets and other pieces of furniture of rare wood, 

such as ebony, tulip-wood, rosewood, satinwood, and others. It was not always workable in such 

fashion; its weight was one factor against its employment in the solid. But in introducing panels 

and fronts of these richly decorative woods the cabinet-maker of the late seventeenth and 

eighteenth centuries brought colour into his work and employed the highest artistry. The sound 

construction of these old veneered cabinets was before the days of machinery; veneers or slices 

of the wood to be laid on were cut by hand, and were one-eighth of an inch thick, hence their 

stability. Nowadays sheets of veneer are saw-cut and knife-cut, and with modern machinery the 

former vary from twelve to fifteen to the inch, and the latter average about forty sheets to the inch, 

although sheets can be cut, incredible as it may seem, of the thinness of a cigarette paper.  =What 

is Marquetry?=--Marquetry is the inlaying of wood into wood. We have already seen that other 

inlays have their

may read them with greater facility.  6.6. Although the Archbishop of Toledo, Your Highness' 

Preceptor, when       Bishop of Cartagena, asked me for them and presented them to Your 

Highness, nevertheless, because of the long journeys by sea and land       Your Highness has 

made, and of the continual royal occupations, it       may be that Your Highness either has not read 

them or has already       and names. But there is the question as to the application of the old word 

"tarsia," which apparently in the early days included both wood and metal inlays. "Intarsia" is the 

term applied to that particular early type of marquetry which brought inlaying coloured woods to 

such perfection in two great schools, the Italian and the German. By means of woods, either of 

their natural colour or stained, woodworkers

7.7. The daring and unreasonable cupidity of those who count it as       nothing to unjustly shed 

such an immense quantity of human blood,       and to deprive those enormous countries of their 

natural inhabitants       and possessors, by slaying millions of people and stealing 

incomparable treasures, increase every day; and they insist by       various means and school of 

artist craftsmen. Just as the dome of St. Mark's at Venice shows the successive styles of mosaic 

work executed during several centuries from Byzantine to Italian, so the choir stalls show the work 

of the cloistered _intarsiatori_ at the cathedral at Siena, at the cathedral and at S. Maria Novella, 

Florence, at Perugia, at Lucca, at Pavia, at Genoa, and at
