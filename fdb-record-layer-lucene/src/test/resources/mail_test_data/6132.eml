When at last Joe's key was heard in the door, both women leaned slowly forw=
ard, as though the=20

strain were unbearable. And then as Joe came into the hall, Fanny said sudd=
enly, sharp and clear:=20

"No, I won't keep quiet! Joe has got to be told of this!" Ethel wheeled on =
her:  "How odious!"  "I=20

can't help it--he's my friend!"  And the next moment, with Joe in the room,=
 both women were=20

talking to him at once--angrily, incoherently, almost shoving each other aw=
ay. But only for a=20

moment. It was too disgusting! Ethel left off and stood rigid there, while =
Fanny talked on rapidly.=20

She was speaking of how Ethel had cut off Joe from Amy's friends. Ethel hea=
rd only bits of this, for=20

it all seemed so confused and unreal. But she noticed how nervously tired h=
e looked, all keyed up=20

from his day at the office. She remembered that his partner was out of town=
 on business, that Joe=20

had been running the office alone. "He will be hard to manage," she thought=
. He interrupted Fanny=20

in a sharp, excitable tone.  "What's it all about?" he asked.  "It's time y=
ou saw where you stand,=20

Joe Lanier. Look at this girl. I don't blame her, God knows. Look how young=
 she is, and then look=20

at yourself. Here, take a look at yourself in that mirror. Are you still yo=
ung? Can't you see the lines,=20

the gray hairs, Joe? They're coming--oh, they're coming! Can you supply all=
 the love she wants?"=20

"Fanny?" he snapped out her name in so ugly a voice that she lost no time. =
She shoved those=20

papers into his hands and began to tell him what they were. But Joe refused=
 to read them and=20

grew each moment angrier.  "Joe!" cried Fanny sharply. "When you brought Dw=
ight to dinner here,=20

he met your wife as though for case of a person whose name does not appear =
in such copy, a=20

certified copy, under the hand of the registrar, of the entry of his name o=

 s. 5).  STUDENTS.=E2=80=94No=20

ed from the provincial=20

medical board a certificate that he has satisfactorily passed a matriculati=
on examination in the=20

subjects specified in the chapter (_ib._, s. 6).  The chapter prescribes th=
e prerequisites to=20

ceive a license to practise=20

unless he satisfy the board that he has passed the matriculation or prelimi=
nary examination; that=20

after passing such examination he has followed his studies during a period =
not less than four=20

years (one of which may be under the direction of one or more general pract=
itioners duly licensed);=20

that during such four years he has attended at some university, college, or=
 incorporated school of=20

medicine in good standing, courses of lectures amounting together to not le=
ss than twelve months=20

on general anatomy, on practical anatomy, on surgery, on the practice of me=
dicine, on midwifery,=20

on chemistry, on materia medica and pharmacy, and on the institutes of=20


_
friends for months?" And at his startled look, she added, "If you didn't, y=
ou'd better read all this!"=20

There fell a sudden silence.  "I'll explain everything--when we're alone," =
Ethel managed to put in.=20

How queer and thick her own voice sounded.  Now Joe had gone into the hall =
with Fanny. Curtly=20

he said good-night to her. The door closed, and there was silence again. Wh=
y didn't he come? He=20

must be standing there in the hall trying to get hold of himself. Oh, how t=
erribly hurt he must feel!=20

But she checked the sudden lump in her throat. "Remember now--just common s=
ense!" This was=20

a time for keeping clear! But Joe had come back into the room, physiology, =
and one three-months=E2=80=99=20

course of medical jurisprudence; that he has attended the general practice =
of a hospital in which=20

are not less than fifty beds under the charge of not less than two physicia=
ns or surgeons, for a=20

period of not less than one year or two periods of not less than six months=
 each; that he has also=20

attended two three-months=E2=80=99 courses or one six-months=E2=80=99 cours=
e of clinical medicine, and the same=20

of clinical surgery; that he has, after an examination in the subjects of t=
he course, obtained a=20

degree or diploma from such university, college, or incorporated medical sc=

such degree or diploma, that he=20


_
gilt mirror into which Fanny had told him to look, he stopped a moment.  "D=
on't do that, Joe!" In an=20

instant, in spite of herself, her love for him rose up in a wave, with fear=
 and pity and anger, too.=20

She came to him, and her voice was shaking. "Oh, Joe--Joe! Can't you see it=
's all lies? It's so=20

loathsome--every word! And so cheap--so cheap and mean!"  As she spoke, his=
 eyes were rapidly=20

scanning the report he still had in his hands. Again she noticed how tired =
he was. He looked up at=20

her:  "I know it is! But why didn't you treat it like that? Why did you try=
 to make her keep quiet?=20

Weren't you trying, when I an examination in the various branches hereinbef=

bout you? Why did you=20

pretend, when I brought Dwight here, that you'd never laid eyes on him befo=
re? Had you or hadn't=20

you? Careful, now! Fanny says it is all here!"  "I'll explain in one word!"=
  "What's the word? Say it,=20

please--and for God's sake clear this up!"  She was breathing hard, frighte=
ned, her mind in a whirl.=20

Oh, to be able to think clearly! Use a little common sense!  "Just a minute=
!" she gasped. "You'll=20

see in a minute--"  "I see a good deal! It's right in your eyes! What are y=

--ever since?"  "Be=20

careful, Joe," she cried angrily. But in his condition, nerves on edge, he =
paid no heed and went=20

rapidly on:  "I'm just a business man! And you've made me feel your contemp=
t for all that! And he's=20

a musician, he's different--he has exactly what you want! So you went to hi=
s studio twice a week--

for months and months--without letting me know--although he was a friend of=
 mine! And you went=20

to the Ritz and the opera! And then I brought him here to dine! God, how yo=
u two must have=20

smiled at each other--when I wasn't looking!"  "Joe! Joe!"  "You lied to me=
, didn't you, when he=20

came! You say you'll explain it in a word! Well, what's the word? I'm waiti=

Her face was white. "I don't care to  POWERS OF BOARD.=E2=80=94The said boa=

nearly changed her=20

mind. But her anger came again. "I won't!" she thought. "Not tonight!"  "Th=
