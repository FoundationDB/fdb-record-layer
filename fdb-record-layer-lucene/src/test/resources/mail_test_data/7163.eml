Jack, on their way, their thanks for the spread.  "I've had the best time in my life!" exclaimed Will 

as he clasped Jack's hand at his door. "I can't thank you enough."  "Then don't try," replied Jack. 

"Brace up, and you'll be all right."  "I will."  Whether it was the effect of the pie or doughnuts Jack 

never knew, but some time during the night he began to dream that he had swallowed a big piece 

of pastry the wrong way, and it was choking him. He sat up, gasping for breath, and found to his 

horror that his room was full of smoke.  "There's a fire!" he spoke aloud. Then he called to Nat, 

who was in the bed across from him:  "Nat! Nat! Wake up! There's a fire!"  "No, I can't get up any 

higher," sleepily responded Nat, turning over in bed, and evidently thinking that his chum had 

asked him to climb up a tree.  "It's a fire!" cried Jack, springing from bed. "There's a fire, Nat!" 

This roused the sleeping lad, who also bounded out from under the covers. There was no doubt 

about it. Their room was filled with smoke, which was getting thicker every minute.  "Fire! Fire! 

Fire!" yelled Jack, for he heard no one stirring about in the school dormitory, and he rightly 

guessed that he was the first to sound the alarm.  His call was sufficient to arouse students on 

either side of him, and then Martin and several of the teachers came running from their 

apartments.  "Where is the fire, Ranger?" asked Mr. Gales, one of the mathematical instructors.  "I 

don't know, but my room is full of smoke."  Just then, from somewhere below stairs, sounded a 

cry:  "Fire! Fire! the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this

"That's Socker, the janitor," declared Jack. "Come on, fellows, we'll help him."  He rushed for the 

stairs, attired in his pajamas and slippers, and was followed by Nat and a score of other students. 

"Boys, boys! Be careful!" called Mr. Gales.  Meanwhile, the smoke was getting thicker, and every 

one was beginning to cough.  "Fire! Fire!" yelled Socker.  Jack, leading the rush of pupils through 

the smoke, soon reached the boiler-room in the basement. Through the clouds of vapor,
