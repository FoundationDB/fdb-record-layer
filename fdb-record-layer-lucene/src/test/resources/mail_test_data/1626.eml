"We can't cross the creek, Ruthie!" shrieked Helen. "He will get us, sure."=
  "But we can get below=20

 is exciting him so."  In=20

a flash Ruth Fielding snatched the red cap from her chum's head and ran on =
with it toward the=20

bank of the creek. The others followed her while the big bull, swerving in =

crying as she ran. Tom kept a few feet behind the girls, although times as =
old, felt it too. He felt=20

that to have this child in his hands and the management of a great estate f=
or so long a minority,=20

was worth something in the list of his ambitions; and thus they all went fo=
rth, trooping into the long=20

line of carriages that shone in the veiled autumnal sunlight, up and down t=
he avenue among the=20

trees in endless succession. Even to get them under way was no small matter=
; and at the lodge=20

 people waiting to=20

big bull overtaken him, it would be hard to say. And for several moments it=
 looked very much as=20

though Hiram Bassett's herd-leader was going to reach his prey.  The thunde=

their ears. They did not speak again as they came to the steep bank down to=
 the open creek.=20

There, just before them, was an old hollow stump, perhaps ten feet high, wi=
th the opening on the=20

creek side. All three of them knew it well.  As Helen went over the bank an=
d disappeared on one=20

side of the stump, Tom darted around the other side. Ruth, with the red cap=
 in her hand, stumbled=20

over a root and fell to her knees. She was right beside the hollow stump, a=
nd Helen's cap caught=20

in a twig and was snatched from her hand.  As Ruth scrambled aside and then=
 fairly rolled over=20

the edge of the bank out of sight, the cap was left dangling right in front=
 of the stump. The bull=20

charged it. That flashing bit of color was what had attracted the brute fro=
m the start.  As the three=20

Ye're pitting things thegither that hae nae natural sequence; but ye ken na=
