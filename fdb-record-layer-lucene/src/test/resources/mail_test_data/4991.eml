philodendron monstera use the contents, subject to such division--not to exceed one-half to each of us--as I may demand on my return. The same conditions will apply to the other chest for an additional period of five pencil-cases and what not as farewell gifts from the steamer to the tender, and _vice versa_; she described the scamper round Queenstown and the waiting for the mails; then the long days on the wide philodendron monstera use the contents, subject to such division--not to exceed one-half to each of us--as I may demand on my return. The same conditions will apply to the other chest for an additional period of five pencil-cases and what not as farewell gifts from the steamer to the tender, and _vice versa_; she described the scamper round Queenstown and the waiting for the mails; then the long days on the wide _
shore-line, which Captain Kidd was observing with great interest. Some near-by point was 

evidently the destination. At length, at his orders, the sails were lowered and the anchor dropped. 

"We will lie here to-day," he remarked, "and have a little rest."  This information met the ready the 

putting out of the lines again.  'Look here, Ronald,' she said seriously.  'What do you think I came 

here for?  Do you think I came here to leave my bones in a foreign land?  I am just about dead 

now.  My arms are not made of steel.  We can go ashore, and get lunch unpacked; the other

themselves in careless groups about the ship. They knew it would be a day of idleness; because 

there were no forays to be made upon the land, for the reason that there wore no human 

habitations in those parts. To the buccaneers the locality was well known as furnishing a safe 

retreat when retirement from active work was desired.  During the day there were singing, 

dancing, feasting. It was a day such as only a gallant corsair could have with his merry crew. The 

hours sped swiftly; and at dusk anchors were weighed, and the ship moved a few miles to the 

northward.  Captain Kidd, standing at the prow, called Captain Redfield to him. "Captain," said he, 

"I wish to entrust you with a most important service. I am somewhat enough.  I tell you my arms 

and wrists have just had about enough for one morning.'  And a very snug and merry little 

luncheon-party they made there--down by the side of the lapping water, and under the shelter of a 

wood of young birch-trees.  For the other boat had brought ashore two salmon; so that the five 

handsome fish, laid side by side on a broad slab of rock, made an excellent show.  Miss Carry 

said nothing about her arms aching; but she did not seem to be in as great a hurry as the others to 

set to work again.  No; she enjoyed the rest; and, observing that Ronald had finished his lunch, 

she called to him, under the pretext of wanting to know something about sending the fish south. 

This led on to other things; 


_
the men; but still I do not feel at ease for a journey to New England. You appreciate the situation. I 

wish to make a deposit; and, as our interests along the coast are now beginning to be extensive, I 

desire to detail you as a resident of Carolina to keep an oversight for me. You will live on this coast 

near the location of to-night's deposit. You will find the climate agreeable, and other things 

favorable. I will hand you for your own use, in case of need, gold to the value of one thousand 

pounds. Is it agreeable, Captain?"  "Aye, sir; your wishes are my orders."  "Then, swear by the 

Holy Virgin that you will faithfully watch over the stuff; that you will not touch the chests or their 

contents, nor give any information or suggestion that might lead any one to their discovery--in fact, 

that you will not disclose to any one the object of your residence in this secluded place."  Captain 

Redfield doffed his hat, and, raising his Ronald even making bold enough to light his pipe.  A very 

friendly little group this was--away by themselves there in these wintry solitudes--with the wide 

blue waters of the lake in front of them, and the snows of Clebrig white against the sky.  And if he 

were to go away from these familiar scenes, might he not come back again in the after days?  And 

with the splendid power of remaining or going, just as he pleased?--just as these friendly folk 

could, who spoke so lightly of choosing this or that quarter of the globe for their temporary 

habitation?  Yes, there were many things that money could do: these two strangers, now, could 

linger here at Inver-Mudal just as long as the salmon-fishing continued to amuse them; or they 

could cross over to Paris, and see the wonders there; or they could go away back to the great 

cities and harbours and lakes and huge hotels that they spoke so much about. He listened with 

intensest interest, 


_
"Captain, I so swear."  "Your hand with the oath, Redfield. You are a trusty fellow, and I have the 

fullest confidence in you."  "Thank you, Captain."  "But, hold," Captain Kidd continued in his great 

benevolent voice, "I had forgotten the conditions. They are: You are to keep the engagement, if 

necessary, for five years. Our calling; as you know, is a little uncertain. At the end of that period, if 

I have not returned, you will be at liberty to take up the smaller chest imagination.  And was this 

part of the shore around them--with its rocks and brushwood and clear water--really like the shores 

of Lake George, where she was so afraid of rattlesnakes?  She said she would send him some 

photographs of Lake Michigan.  Then in the boat in the afternoon she quite innocently remarked 

that she wished he was going back home with them; for that he would find the voyage across the 

Atlantic so amusing.  She described the people coming out to say
