(p. 798): "It was the usage of the Spaniards to designate as a tribe each g=
roup of people which=20

had a dialect, more or less peculiar, of its own. Furthermore, the custom w=
hich is widespread=20

among the hill people of northern Luzon of shouting out the name of a settl=
ement when they desire=20

to call for one or more persons belonging to it, seems in many instances to=
 have led the Spaniards=20

to adopt settlement names as tribal ones, even when there were no differenc=
es of dialect between=20

the peoples thus designated."--Eds.  [42] The fullest and most authoritativ=
e account of the=20

Negritos is, of course, the monograph by W. A. Reed, The Negritos of Zambal=
es, published by the=20

Philippine Ethnological Survey. See also Worcester's account of them in his=
 "Non-Christian Tribes=20

of Northern Luzon," in Philippine Journal of Science, October, 1906, pp. 80=
5 et seq.--Eds.  [43]=20

See Le Gentil, Voyage aux Indes.  [44] Is not this, or something resembling=
 it, a custom of the=20

natives of Australasia?  [45] See Herrera and Ant. de Solis, Hist. of Mexic=
o.  [46] The negro of the=20

east appears to have amalgamated with some other family. On the south coast=
s of Australasia,=20

they resemble in many points the several fires; while with binocular glasse=
s we could make out the=20

figures of the blacks fishing, and of the piccaninnies and gins romping in =
the sand.  Lizzie was a=20

sight to see, as she pointed triumphantly to the unconscious savages, and, =
trembling with=20

eagerness, tapped the butt of Dunmore's carbine, as she whispered--  "Those=
 fellow sit down=20

there, brother belonging to me, plenty you shoot 'em, Marmy."  "You take us=
 close up along of=20

those fellow, Lizzie?" said Dunmore.  "Your Marmy, plenty close, you been s=
hoot 'em all mine=20

think," replied our amiable little guide, who, enjoining the strictest sile=
nce, at once put herself in=20

motion, bidding us, by a sign, to follow her.  For more than an hour and a =
half we crept cautiously=20

along, sometimes crawling on all fours where the country was open, and freq=
uently stopping, while=20

Lizzie went noiselessly forward and reconnoitred, before beckoning to us to=
 advance again.  The=20

direction in which she led us lay at the base of the hills, which on one si=
de bounded the little plain=20

and its bay, and though we could form but a crude idea of where we were goi=
ng, owing to the=20

thickness of the undergrowth, yet it was sufficiently evident=20


_
as Cape Capricorn. To the northward of this, as far as Murray's Islands in =
Torres Straits, they are=20

a stout, tall, athletic race of men, [46-A] and as hairy on the face and bo=
dy as Europeans, with=20

long hair, and without the negro cast of countenance. This race may be trac=
ed by intervals to=20

Ternate, Gilolo, &c., where they are called Harraforas; [46-B] tacticians, =
and meditated a flank=20

blow at her unfortunate relatives. Proceeding, we came at last within a sto=
ne's throw of the beach,=20

and could hear the mimic waves rolling on the sand, at no great distance, o=
n our right hand.  Lizzie=20

now pointed to a small belt of vine shrub that lay in front of us, and indi=
cated that immediately=20

outside it were the=20


_
some relationship to them). Is not the native of New Ireland and Queen Char=
lotte's Islands too of=20

this race? [46-C] The difference between them is most striking. The one are=
 dwarfish negroes, the=20

others almost black Europeans. Both are essentially different from the Mala=
y family, and not only=20

so, but from each other (the native of Amboyna, I think, forms the link bet=
ween them) and this=20

difference is apparently anatomical, in the shape of the skull, facial angl=
es, &c.  We are as yet in=20

the infancy of our knowledge of the origin of these various families of the=
 human race: like that of=20

languages, it will in all probability remain one more of conjecture than of=
 fact; but it is white teeth=20

as she grinned with glee at the thoughts of the cheerful surprise she had p=
repared for her old=20

companions.  We were not thoroughly on the 'qui vive', for we thought this =
unknown bay would be=20

the very spot in which the blacks were likely to seclude any prisoners from=
 the 'Eva', and=20

accordingly willingly followed the lithe figure of our little guide, as she=
 wound her way through the=20

tangled brake, like a black snake, and with a facility that we in vain atte=
mpted to imitate.  The=20

troopers--who had reduced their clothing to a minimum, for their sole vestm=
ent consisted of a=20

forage-cap and cartridge-belt--wound along as noiselessly as Lizzie; but we=
 poor whites--with=20
