at unnamed sixth sense=20

peculiar to cab-drivers and waiters and married women told me that every mo=
ment on the bald=20

little platform was being a torture to her. As the big engine came lumberin=
g up to a standstill she=20

gave me one quick and searching look. It was a look I shall never forget. F=
or, in it was a question=20

and something more than a question. An unworded appeal was there, and also =
an unworded=20

protest. It got past my outposts of reason, in some way. It came to me in m=
y bitterness like the=20

smell of lilacs into a sick-room. I couldn't be cruel to that poor crushed =
outcast who had suffered=20

quite as much from the whole ignoble affair to the public, even though you =
were blameless,=20

became torture to you. Peace to thy ashes, on which no guilt rests save tha=
t thou wert not=20

exceptionally wise or exceptionally strong."  Leopold was inclined to go ho=
me, but remained in=20

England by the advice of Stockmar, who perceived that, in the first place, =
there would be=20

something odious in the Prince's spending his English allowance of L50,000 =
a year on the=20

Continent, and in the second place, that a good position in England would b=
e his strongest=20

vantage ground in case of any new opening presenting itself elsewhere.  Abo=
ut this time another=20

birth took place in the Royal Family under happier auspices. The Duke of Ke=
nt was married to the=20

widowed Princess of=20


_
suddenly held out my hand to her, and she took it, with that hungry questio=
ning look still on her=20

face.  "It's all right," I started to say. But her head suddenly went down =
between her hunched-up=20

shoulders. Her body began to shake and tears gushed from her eyes. I had to=
 help her to the car=20

steps.  "It was all my fault," she said in a strangled voice, between her h=
elpless little sobs.  It was=20

brave of her, of course, and she meant it for the best. But I wish she hadn=
't said it. Instead of=20

making everything easier for me, as she intended, she only made it harder. =
She left me=20

disturbingly conscious of ghostly heroisms which transposed what I had trie=
d to regard as=20

essentially ignoble into some higher and purer key. And she made it harder =
for me to look at my=20

husband, when I got home, with a calm and collected eye. I felt suspiciousl=
y like Lady Macbeth=20

after the second murder. I felt that we were fellow-sharers of a guilty sec=
ret it would never do to=20

drag too often into the light of every-day life.  But it will no more stay =
under cover, I find, than a=20

dab-chick will stay under water. It bobs up in the most unexpected places, =
as it did last night, when=20

Dinkie publicly proclaimed that he was going to marry his Mummy when he got=
 big.  "It would be=20

well, my son, not to repeat the mistakes of your father!" observed Dinky-Du=
nk. And having said it,=20

he politics, on bad terms with his brothers, and in financial difficulties =
which prevented his living in=20

England. Finding, however, that his Duchess was likely to present him with =
an heir who would also=20

be the heir to the Crown, and being very anxious that the child should be b=
orn in England, he=20

obtained the means of coming home through friends, after appealing to his b=
rothers in vain.=20

Shortly after his return "a pretty little princess, plump as a partridge," =
was born. In the same year=20

the Duke died. His widow, owing to his debts, was left in a very uncomforta=
ble position. Her=20

brother Leopold enabled her to return to Kensington, where she devoted hers=
elf to the education=20

of her child-- Queen Victoria.  The first opening which presented itself to=
 Leopold was the Kingdom=20

of Greece, which was offered him by "The Powers." After going pretty far he=
 backed out, much to=20

the disgust of "The Powers," who called him "Marquis Peu-a-peu" (the nickna=
me given him by=20

George IV.) and said that "he had no colour," and that he wanted the Englis=
h Regency. The fact=20

seems to be that he and his Stockmar, on further consideration of the enter=
prise, did not like the=20

look of it. Neither of them, especially Stockmar, desired a "crown of thorn=
s," which their=20

disinterested advisers would have had them take on heroic and ascetic princ=
iples. Leopold was=20

rather attracted by the=20


_
pipe and refused to meet my eye. But it didn't take a surgical operation to=
 get what he meant into=20

my head. It hurt, in more ways than one, for it struck me as suspiciously l=
ike a stone embodied in a=20

snowball--and even our offspring recognized this as no fair manner of fight=
ing.  "Then it impresses=20

you as a mistake?" I demanded, seeing red, for the coyote in me, I'm afraid=
, will never entirely=20

become house-dog.  "Isn't that the way you regard it?" he asked, inspecting=
 me with a non-

committal eye.  I had to bite my lip, to keep from flinging out at him the =
which Greece would have=20

afforded, I am not inclined to give very much. Mortals see only the bad sid=
e of things they have,=20

and the good side of the things they have not. That is the whole difference=
 between Greece and=20

Belgium, though I do not mean to deny that when the first King of Greece sh=
all, after all manner of=20

toils, have died, his life may not furnish the poet with excellent matter f=
or an epic poem." The=20

philosophic creed of Stockmar was that "the most valuable side of life cons=
ists in its negative=20

conditions,"--in other words in freedom from annoyance,=20


_
were huddled back in my heart. But it was no time for making big war medici=
ne. So I got the lid on,=20

and held it there.  "My dear Dinky-Dunk," I said with an effort at a gestur=
e of weariness, "I've long=20

since learned that life can't be made clean, like a cat's body, by the use =
of the tongue alone!"=20

Dinky-Dunk did not look at me. Instead, he turned to the boy who was watchi=
ng that scene with a=20

small frown of perplexity on his none too approving face.  "You go up to th=
e nursery," commanded=20

my husband, with more curtness than usual.  But before Dinkie went he slowl=
y crossed the room=20

and kissed me. He did so with a quiet resoluteness which was not without it=
s tacit touch of=20

challenge.  "You may feel that way about the use of the tongue," said my hu=
sband as soon as we=20

were alone, "but I'm going to unload a few things I've been keeping under c=
over."  He waited for=20

me to say something. But I preferred  The candidature of Leopold for the Gr=
eek Throne coincided=20

with the Wellington Administration, and the active part taken by Stockmar g=
ave him special=20

opportunities of studying the Duke's political character which he did with =
great attention. His=20

estimate of it is low.  "The way in which Wellington would preserve and hus=
band the rewards of his=20

own services and the gifts of fortune, I took as the measure of the higher =
capabilities of his mind. It=20

required no long time, however, and no great exertion, to perceive that the=
 natural sobriety of his=20

temperament, founded upon an inborn want of sensibility, was unable to with=
stand the intoxicating=20

influence of the flattery by which he was surrounded. The knowledge of hims=
elf became visibly=20

more and more obscured. The restlessness of his activity, and his natural l=

daily more ungovernable.  "Blinded by the language of his admirers, and=20
