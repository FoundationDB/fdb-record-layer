for he couldn't keep them. What about his people? Will they want to interfe=
re?"  "I don't think so;=20

from the little he told us they are not very well off. They live in Guernse=
y. His father was something=20

in salt, I think, out here. We've none of us seen them. They didn't come to=
 Fay's wedding. I gather=20

they are very strict in their views--both his father and mother--and there =
are two sisters. But Fay=20

said Hugo hardly ever wrote--or heard from them."  "There's just one thing =
you must face, Miss=20

Ross," and Peter felt a brute as he looked at Jan pale and startled in the =
bright moonlight. "Hugo=20

Tancred might marry again."  "Oh, surely no one would marry him after all t=
his!"  "Whoever did=20

would probably know nothing of 'all this.' Remember Hugo Tancred has a way =
with women; he's a=20

fascinating chap when he likes, he's good-looking and plausible, and always=
 has an excellent=20

reason for all his misfortunes. If he does marry again he'll marry money, a=
nd _then_ he might=20

demand the children."  "Perhaps she wouldn't want them."  "We'll hope not."=
  "And I can do=20

nothing--nothing to make them safe?"  "I fear--nothing--only your best for =
them."  "I'll do that," said=20

Jan.  They stood shoulder to shoulder in the scented stillness of the night=
. The shadows were=20

black and sharp in the bright moonlight and the tom-toms throbbed in the ci=
ty below.  "I wonder,"=20

Jan said presently, "if I shall ever be able to do anything for you, Mr. Le=
dgard. You have done=20

everything for us out here."  "Would you really like to do something?" Pete=
r asked eagerly. "I=20

wouldn't have mentioned it if you hadn't said that just now. Would you writ=
e pretty often? You see,=20

I've no people of my very own. Aunts and uncles and cousins don't keep in t=
ouch with one out=20

here. They're kind, awfully kind when I go home on leave, but it takes a ma=
n's own folk to=20

remember to write every mail."  "I'll write every mail," Jan promised eager=
ly, "and when you take=20

your next leave, remember we expect you at Wren's End."  "I'll remember," s=
aid Peter, "and it may=20

be sooner than you think."  They sailed next day. Jan had spent six weeks i=
n Bombay, and the=20

whole thing seemed a dream.  The voyage back was very different from the vo=
yage out. The boat=20

was crowded, and nearly all were Service people going home on leave. Jan fo=
und them very kind=20

and friendly, and the children, with plenty of others to play with, were fo=
r the most part happy and=20

good.  The journey across France was rather horrid. Little Fay was as obstr=
eperous as Tony was=20

disagreeably silent and aloof. Jan thanked heaven when the crowded train st=
eamed into Charing=20

Cross.  There, at the very door of their compartment, a girl was waiting. A=
 girl so small, she might=20

have been a child except for a certain decision and capability about everyt=
hing she did. She=20

seized Jan, kissed her hurriedly and announced that she had got a nice litt=
le furnished flat for them=20

till they should go to the country, and that Hannah had tea ready; this you=
ng person, herself,=20

helped to carry their smaller baggage to a taxi, packed them in, demanded J=
an's keys and=20

announced that she would bring the luggage in another taxi. She gave the ad=
dress to the man,=20



and a written slip to Jan, and vanished to collect their cabin baggage.  It=
 was all done so briskly=20

and efficiently that it left Ayah and the children quite breathless, accust=
omed as they were to the=20

leisurely methods of the East.  "Who is vat mem?" asked little Fay, as the =
taxi door was slammed=20

by this energetic young person.  "Is she quite a mem?" suggested the accura=
te Tony. "Is she old=20

enough or big enough?"  "Who is vat mem?" little Fay repeated.  "That," sai=
d Jan with=20

considerable satisfaction in her voice, "is Meg."     CHAPTER IX  MEG   It =
was inevitable as the=20

refrain of a _rondeau_ that when Jan said "that's Meg" little Fay should de=
mand "What nelse?"=20

Now there was a good deal of "nelse" about Meg, and she requires some expla=
nation, going back=20

several years.  Like most Scots, Anthony Ross had been faithful to his rela=
tions whether he felt=20

affection for them or not; sometimes even when they had not a thought in co=
mmon with him and=20

he rather disliked them than otherwise.  And this was so in the case of one=
 Amelia Ross, his first=20

cousin, who was head-mistress of a flourishing and well-established school =
for "young ladies," in=20

the Regent's Park district.  She had been a head-mistress for many years, a=
nd was well over fifty=20

when she married a meek, small, nothingly man who had what Thackeray calls =
"a little patent=20

place." And it appeared that she added the husband to the school in much th=
e same spirit as she=20

would have increased the number of chairs in her dining-room, and with no m=
ore appreciable=20

result in her life. On her marriage she became Mrs. Ross-Morton, and Mr. Mo=
rton went in and out=20

of the front door, breakfasted and dined at Ribston Hall, caught his bus at=
 the North Gate and went=20

daily to his meek little work. It is presumed that he lived on terms of aff=
ectionate intimacy with his=20

wife, but no one who saw them together could have gathered this.  Now Antho=
ny Ross disliked his=20

cousin Amelia. He detested her school, which he considered was one of the w=
orst examples of a=20

bad old period. He suspected her of being hard and grasping, he knew she wa=
s dull, and her=20

husband bored him--not to tears, but to profanity. Yet since she was his co=
usin and a hard-

working, upright woman, and since they had played together as children in S=
cotland and her father=20

and mother had been kind to him then, he could never bring himself to drop =
Amelia. Not for worlds=20

would he have allowed Jan or Fay to go to her school, but he did allow them=
, or rather he humbly=20

entreated them, to visit it occasionally when invited to some function or o=
ther. Jan's education after=20

her mother's death had been the thinnest scrape sandwiched between many hou=
sehold cares and=20

much attendance upon her father's whims. Fay was allowed classes and visiti=
ng governesses, but=20

their father could never bring himself to spare either of them to the regul=
ar discipline of school, and=20

Cousin Amelia bewailed the desultory training of Anthony's children.  In 19=
05, Jan and Fay had=20

been to a party at Ribston Hall: tea in the garden followed by a pastoral p=
lay. Anthony was sitting=20

in the balcony, smoking, when the girls came back. He saw their hansom and =
ran downstairs to=20

meet them, as he always did. They were a family who went in for affectionat=
e greetings.  "Daddie,"=20

cried Fay, seizing her father by the arm, "one of the seven wonders of the =
world has happened.=20

We have found an interesting person at Ribston Hall."  Jan took the other a=
rm. "We can't possibly=20

tell you all about it under an hour, so we'd better go and sit in the balco=
ny." And they gently=20

propelled him towards the staircase.  "Not if you're going to discuss Cousi=
n Amelia," Anthony=20

protested. "You have carrying voices, both of you."  "Cousin Amelia is only=
 incidental," Jan said,=20

when they were all three seated in the balcony. "The main theme is concerne=
d with a queer little=20

pixie creature called Meg Morton. She's a pupil-governess, and she's sixtee=
n and a half--just the=20

same age as Fay."  "She doesn't reach up to Jan's elbow," Fay added, "and s=
he chaperons the=20



girls for music and singing, and sits in the drawing-class because the mast=
er can't be quite=20

seventy yet."  "She's the wee-est thing you ever saw, and they dress her in=
 Cousin Amelia's=20

discarded Sunday frocks."  "That's impossible," Anthony interrupted. "Ameli=
a is so massive and=20

square; if the girl's so small she'd look like 'the Marchioness.'"  "She do=
es, she does!" Jan cried=20

delightedly. "Of course the garments are 'made down,' but in the most elder=
ly way possible.=20

Daddie, can you picture a Botticelli angel of sixteen, with masses of Titia=
n-red hair, clad in a queer=20

plush garment once worn by Cousin Amelia, that retains all its ancient frum=
piness of line. And it's=20

not only her appearance that's so quaint, _she_ is quaint inside."  "We wer=
e attracted by her hair,"=20

Fay went on "(You'll go down like a ninepin before that hair), and we got h=
er in a corner and=20

hemmed her in and declared it was her duty to attend to us because we were =
strangers and shy,=20

and in three minutes we were friends. Sixteen, Daddie! And a governess-pupi=
l in Cousin Amelia's=20

school. She's a niece of the little husband, and Cousin Amelia is preening =
herself like anything=20

because she takes her for nothing and makes her work like ten people."  "Di=
d the little girl say so?"=20

"Of course not," Jan answered indignantly, "but Cousin Amelia did. Oh, how =
thankful I am she is=20

_your_ cousin, dear, and once-removed from us!"  "How many generations will=
 it take to remove=20

her altogether?" Fay asked. "However," she added, "if we can have the pixie=
 out and give her a=20

good time I shan't mind the relationship so much. We _must_ do something, D=
addie. What shall it=20

be?"  Anthony Ross smoked thoughtfully and said very little. Perhaps he did=
 not even listen with=20

marked attention, because he was enjoying his girls. Just to see them healt=
hy and happy; to know=20

that they were naturally kind and gay; to hear them frank and eager and loq=
uacious--sometimes=20

gave him a sensation of almost physical pleasure. He was like an idler bask=
ing in the sun,=20

conscious of nothing but just the warmth and comfort of it.  Whatever those=
 girls wanted they=20

always got. Anthony's diplomacy was requisitioned and was, as usual, succes=
sful; for, in spite of=20

her disapproval, Mrs. Ross-Morton could never resist her cousin's charm. Th=
is time the result was=20

that one Saturday afternoon in the middle of June little Meg Morton, bearin=
g a battered leather=20

portmanteau and clad in the most-recently-converted plush abomination, appe=
ared at the tall=20

house in St. George's Square to stay over the week-end.  It was the mid-ter=
m holiday, and from=20

the first moment to the last the visit was one almost delirious orgy of ple=
asure to the little pupil-

governess.  It was also a revelation.  It would be hard to conceive of anyt=
hing odder than the=20

appearance of Meg Morton at this time. She just touched five feet in height=
, and was very=20

slenderly and delicately made, with absurd, tiny hands and feet. Yet there =
was a finish about the=20

thin little body that proclaimed her fully grown. Her eyes, with their thic=
k, dark lashes, looked=20

overlarge in the pale little pointed face; strange eyes and sombre, with bi=
g, bright pupil, and=20

curious dark-blue iris flecked with brown. Her features were regular, and h=
er mouth would have=20

been pretty had the lips not lacked colour. As it was, all the colour about=
 Meg seemed=20

concentrated in her hair; red as a flame and rippled as a river under a fre=
sh breeze. There was so=20

much of it, too, the little head seemed bowed in apology beneath its weight=
.  Yet for the time being=20

Meg forgot to be apologetic about her hair, for Anthony and his girls frank=
ly admired it.  These=20

adorable, kind, amusing people actually admired it, and said so. Hitherto M=
eg's experience had=20

been that it was a thing to be slurred over, like a deformity. If mentioned=
, it was to be deprecated.=20

In the strictly Evangelical circles where hitherto her lot had been cast, t=
hey even tried vainly to=20

explain it away.  She had, of course, heard of artists, but she never expec=
ted to meet any. That=20



sort of thing lay outside the lives of those who had to make their living a=
s quickly as possible in=20

beaten tracks; tracks so well-beaten, in fact, that all the flowers had bee=
n trodden underfoot and=20

exterminated.  Meg, at sixteen, had received so little from life that her e=
xpectations were of the=20

humblest. And as she stood before the glass in a pretty bedroom, fastening =
her one evening dress=20

(of shiny black silk that crackled, made with the narrow V in front affecte=
d by Mrs. Ross-Morton),=20

preparatory to going to the play for the first time in her life, she could =
have exclaimed, like the little=20

old woman of the story, "This be never I!"  Anthony Ross was wholly surpris=
ing to Meg.  This=20

handsome, merry gentleman with thick, brown hair as crinkly as her own; who=
 was domineered=20

over and palpably adored by these two, to her, equally amazing girls--seeme=
d so very, very young=20

to be anybody's father.  He frankly owned to enjoying things.  Now, accordi=
ng to Meg's=20

experience, grown-up people--elderly people--seldom enjoyed anything; above=
 all, never alluded=20

to their enjoyment.  Life was a thing to be endured with fortitude, its sor=
rows borne with Christian=20

resignation; its joys, if there were any joys, discreetly slurred over. Joy=
s were insidious, dangerous=20

things that might lead to the leaving undone of obvious duties. To seek joy=
 and insure its being=20

shared by others, bravely and honestly believing it to be an excellent thin=
g, was to Meg an entirely=20

unknown frame of mind.  After the play, in Meg's room the three girls were =
brushing their hair=20

together; to be accurate, Jan was brushing Fay's and Meg admiring the proce=
ss.  "Have you any=20

sisters?" Jan asked. She was always interested in people's relations.  "No,=
" said Meg. "There are,=20

mercifully, only three of us, my two brothers and me. If there had been any=
 more I don't know what=20

my poor little Papa would have done."  "Why do you call him your 'poor litt=
le papa'?" Fay asked=20

curiously.  "Because he is poor--dreadfully--and little, and very melanchol=
y. He suffers so from=20

depression."  "Why?" asked the downright Jan.  "Partly because he has indig=
estion, _constant_=20

indigestion, and then there's us, and boys are so expensive, they will grow=
 so. It upsets him=20

dreadfully."  "But they can't help growing," Fay objected.  "It wouldn't ma=
tter so much if they didn't=20

both do it at once. But you see, there's only a year between them, and they=
're just about the same=20

size. If only one had been smaller, he could have worn the outgrown things.=
 As it is, it's always=20

new clothes for both of them. Papa's are no sort of use, and even the cheap=
est suits cost a lot,=20

and boots are perfectly awful."  Meg looked so serious that Fay and Jan, wh=
o were like the lilies of=20

the field, and expected new and pretty frocks at reasonable intervals as a =
matter of course, looked=20

serious too; for the first time confronted by a problem whose possibility t=
hey had never even=20

considered before.  "He must be pleased with you," Jan said, encouragingly.=
 "_You're_ not too=20

big."  "Yes, but then I'm not a boy. Papa's clothes would have made down fo=
r me beautifully if I'd=20

been a boy; as it is, they're no use." Meg sighed, then added more cheerful=
ly. "But I cost less in=20

other ways, and several relations send old clothes to me. They are never to=
o small."  "Do you like=20

the relations' clothes?" Fay asked.  "Of course not," said Meg, simply. "Th=
ey are generally=20

hideous; but, after all, they cover me and save expense."  The spoiled daug=
hters of Anthony Ross=20

gazed at Meg with horror-stricken eyes. To them this seemed a most tragic s=
tate of things.  "Do=20

they all," Fay asked timidly, "wear such ... rich materials--like Cousin Am=
elia?"  "They're fond of=20

plush, as a rule, but there's velveteen as well, and sometimes a cloth dres=
s. One was mustard-

coloured, and embittered my life for a whole year."  Jan suddenly ceased to=
 brush Fay's hair and=20

went and sat on the bed beside Meg and put her arm round her. Fay's pretty =
face, framed in fluffy=20

masses of fair hair, was solemn in excess of sympathy.  "I shouldn't care a=
 bit if only the boys=20



were through Sandhurst and safely into the Indian Army--but I do hate them =
having to go without=20

nearly everything. Trevor's a King's Cadet, but they wouldn't give us two c=
adetships ... Still," she=20

added, more cheerfully, "it's cheaper than anything else for a soldier's so=
n."  "Is your father a=20

soldier?" asked Jan.  "Oh, yes, a major in the Westshires; but he had to le=
ave the Army because=20

of his health, and his pension is very small, and mother had so little mone=
y. I sometimes think it=20

killed her trying to do everything on nothing."  "Were you quite small when=
 she died?" Fay asked in=20

a sympathetic whisper.  "Oh, no; I was nearly twelve, and quite as big as I=
 am now. Then I kept=20

house while the boys were at Bedford, but when they went to Sandhurst poor =
little Papa thought=20

I'd better get some education, too, and Uncle John's wife offered to take m=
e for nothing, so here I=20

am. HERE, it's too wonderful. Who could have dreamed that Ribston Hall woul=
d lead to this?" And=20

Meg snuggled down in Jan's kind embrace, her red hair spread around her lik=
e a veil.  "Are some=20

of the richly-dressed relations nice?" Jan asked hopefully.  "I don't know =
if you'd think them nice--

you seem to expect such a lot from people--but they're quite kind--only it'=
s a different sort of=20

kindness from yours here. They don't laugh and expect you to enjoy yourself=
, like _your_ father.=20

My brothers say they are dull ... they call them--I'm afraid it's very ungr=
ateful--the weariful rich. But=20

I expect we're weariful to them too. I suppose poor relations _are_ boring =
if you're well-off yourself.=20

But we get pretty tired, too, when they talk us over."  "But do you mean to=
 say they talk you over=20

_to_ you?"  "Always," Meg said firmly. "How badly we manage, how improviden=
t we are, how=20

Papa ought to rouse himself and I ought to manage better, and how foolish i=
t is to let the boys go=20

into the Army instead of banks and things ... And yet, you know, it hasn't =
cost much for Trevor, and=20

once he's in he'll be able to manage, and Jo said he'd enlist if there was =
any more talk of banks,=20

and poor little Papa had to give in--so there it is."  "How much older are =
they than you?" Jan=20

asked.  "Trevor's nineteen and Jo's eighteen, and they are the greatest dar=
lings in the world. They=20

always lifted the heavy saucepans for me at Bedford, and filled the buckets=
 and did the outsides of=20

the windows, and carried up the coals to Papa's sitting-room before they we=
nt to school in the=20

morning, and they very seldom grumbled at my cooking...."  "But where were =
the servants?" Fay=20

asked innocently.  Meg laughed. "Oh, we couldn't have any servants. A woman=
 came in the=20

morning. Papa dined at his club, and I managed for the boys and me. But, oh=
 dear, they do eat a=20

lot, and joints are so dear. Sheep's heads and things pall if you have them=
 more than once a=20

week. They're such a mixty sort of meat, so gummy."  "_I_ can cook," Jan an=
nounced, then added=20

humbly, "at least, I've been to classes, but I don't get much practice. Coo=
k isn't at all fond of=20

having me messing in her kitchen."  "It isn't the cooking that's so difficu=
lt," said Meg; "it's getting=20

things to cook. It's all very well for the books to say 'Take' this and tha=
t. My experience is that you=20

can never 'take' anything. You have to buy every single ingredient, and the=
re's never anything like=20

enough. We tried being fruitarians and living on dates and figs and nuts al=
l squashed together, but=20

it didn't seem to come a bit cheaper, for the boys were hungry again direct=
ly and said it was hog-

wash."  "Was your papa a fruitarian too?" Fay asked.  "Oh, no, he can't pla=
y those tricks; he has to=20

be most careful. He never had his meals with us. Our meals would have been =
too rough for him. I=20

got him breakfast and afternoon tea. He generally went out for the others."=
  Jan and Fay looked=20

thoughtful.         *       *       *       *       *  Amelia Ross-Morton w=
as a fair judge of character. When=20

she consented to take her husband's niece as a governess-pupil she had been=
 dubious as to the=20

result. She very soon discovered, however, that the small red-haired girl w=
as absolutely=20



trustworthy, that she had a power of keeping order quite disproportionate t=
o her size, that she got=20

through a perfectly amazing amount of work, and did whatever she was asked =
as a matter of=20

course. Thus she became a valuable factor in the school, receiving nothing =
in return save her food=20

and such clothes as Mrs. Ross-Morton considered too shabby for her own wear=
.  At the end of the=20

first year Meg ceased to receive any lessons. Her day was fully occupied in=
 teaching the younger=20

and chaperoning the elder girls. Only one stipulation did she make at the b=
eginning of each term--

that she should be allowed to accept, on all reasonable occasions, the invi=
tations of Anthony Ross=20

and his daughters, and she made this condition with so much firmness that A=
nthony's cousin knew=20

better than to be unreasonably domineering, as was her usual habit. Moreove=
r, though it was=20

against her principles to do anything to further the enjoyment of persons i=
n a subordinate position,=20

she was, in a way, flattered that Anthony and his girls should thus single =
out her "niece by=20

marriage" and appear to enjoy her society.  Thus it came about that Meg wen=
t a good deal to St.=20

George's Square and nearly always spent part of each holiday with Fay and J=
an wherever they=20

happened to be.  The queer clothes were kept for wear at Ribston Hall, and =
by degrees--although=20

she never had any money--she became possessed of garments more suitable to =
her age and=20

colouring.  Again and again Anthony painted her. She sat for him with untir=
ing patience and=20

devotion. She was always entirely at her ease with him, and prattled away q=
uite simply of the life=20

that seemed to him so inexpressibly hard and dreary.  Only once had he=20

er why it is incorrect to=20

send invitations by post to people living in the same town?"  "But it isn't=
," Anthony objected.=20

"Everybody does it."  "Not in schools," Meg said firmly. "Mrs. Ross-Morton =
will never send=20

invitations to people living in London through the post--she says it isn't =
polite. They must go by=20

hand."  "I never heard such nonsense," Anthony exclaimed crossly. "If she d=
oesn't send 'em by=20

post, how _does_ she send them?"  "I take them generally, in the evening, a=
fter school, and=20

deliver them at all the houses. Some are fairly near, of course--a lot of h=
er friends live in Regent's=20

Park--but sometimes I have to go quite a long way by bus. I don't mind that=
 in summer, when it's=20

light, but in winter it's horrid going about the lonely roads ... People sp=
eak to one...."  Anthony=20

Ross stepped from behind his easel.  "And what do you do?" he asked.  "I ru=
n," Meg said simply,=20



"and I can generally run much faster than they do ... but it's a little bit=
 frightening."  "It's infernal,"=20

Anthony said furiously. "I shall speak to Amelia at once. You are never to =
do it again."  In vain did=20

Meg plead, almost with tears, that he would do nothing of the kind. He was =
roused and firm.  He=20

did "speak to Amelia." He astonished that good lady as much as he annoyed h=
er. Nevertheless=20

Mrs. Ross-Morton used the penny post for her invitations as long as Meg rem=
ained at Ribston=20

Hall.  At the end of two years Major Morton, who had removed from Bedford t=
o Cheltenham, wrote=20

a long, querulous letter to his sister-in-law to the effect that if--like t=
he majority of girls nowadays--

his daughter chose to spend her life far from his sheltering care, it was t=
ime she earned=20

something.  Mrs. Ross-Morton replied that only now was Meg beginning to rep=
ay all the expense=20

incurred on her behalf in the way of board, clothing and tuition; and it wa=
s most unreasonable to=20

expect any salary for quite another year.  Major Morton decided to remove M=
eg from Ribston Hall.=20

Many acrimonious letters passed between her aunt and her father before this=
 was finally=20

accomplished, and Meg left "under a cloud."  To her great astonishment, her=
 meek little uncle=20

appeared at Paddington to see her off. Just as the train was starting he th=
rust an envelope into her=20

hand.  "It hasn't been fair," he almost shouted--for the train was already =
beginning to move. "You=20

worked hard, you deserved some pay ... a little present ... but please don'=
t mention it to your aunt=20

... She is so decided in her views...."  When Meg opened the envelope she f=
ound three ten-pound=20

notes. She had never seen so much money before, and burst into tears; but i=
t was not because of=20

the magnitude of the gift. She felt she had never properly appreciated her =
poor little uncle, and her=20

conscience smote her.  This was at Christmas.  The weariful rich sat in con=
clave over Meg, and it=20

was decided that she should in March go as companion and secretary to a cer=
tain Mrs. Trent=20

slightly known to one of them.  Mrs. Trent was kindly, careless, and quite =
generous as regards=20

money. She had grown-up daughters, and they lived in one of the Home Counti=
es where there are=20

many country-houses and plenty of sport. Meg proved to be exceedingly usefu=
l, did whatever she=20

was asked to do, and a great many things no one had ever done before. She s=
hared in the fun,=20

and for the first time since her mother died was not overworked.  Her emplo=
yer was as keen on=20

every form of pleasure as her own daughters. She exercised the very smalles=
t supervision over=20

them and none at all over the "quite useful" little companion.=20

evident  Many men came to the easy-going, lavish house, and Meg, with prett=

leisure and deliriously prim Ribston-Hallish manners, came in for her full =
share of admiration.  It=20

happened that at the end of July Anthony Ross came up to London in the afte=
rnoon to attend and=20

speak at a dinner in aid of some artists' charity. He and Jan were staying =
with friends at=20

Teddington; Fay, an aunt and the servants were already at Wren's End--all b=
ut Hannah, the=20

severe Scottish housemaid, who remained in charge. She was grim and gaunt a=
nd plain, with a=20

thick, black moustache, and Anthony liked her less than he could have wishe=
d. But she had been=20

Jan's nurse, and was faithful and trustworthy beyond words. He would never =
let Jan go to the=20

country ahead of him, for without her he always left behind everything most=
 vital to his happiness,=20

so she was to join him next day and see that his painting-tackle was all pa=
cked.  The house in St.=20

George's Square was nominally shut up and shrouded in dust-sheets, but Hann=
ah had "opened=20

up" the dining-room on Anthony's behalf, and there he sat and slumbered til=
l she should choose to=20

bring him some tea.  He was awakened by an opening door and Hannah's voice =
announcing, not=20

tea, but:  "Miss Morton to see you, sir."  There seemed a thousand "r's" in=
 both the Morton and the=20

sir, and Anthony, who felt that there was something ominous and arresting i=
n Hannah's voice, was=20

wide-awake before she could shut the door again.  Sure enough it was Meg, c=
lad in a long grey=20

dust-cloak and motor bonnet, the grey veil flung back from a very pale face=
.  Meg, looking a wispy=20

little shadow of woe.  Anthony came forward with outstretched hands.  "Meg,=
 my child, what good=20

wind has blown you here this afternoon? I thought you were having ever such=
 a gay time down in=20

the country."  But Meg made no effort to grasp the greeting hands. On the c=
ontrary, she moved so=20

that the whole width of the dining-room table was between them.  "Wait," sh=
e said, "you mustn't=20

shake hands with me till I tell you what I've done ... perhaps you won't wa=
nt to then."  And Anthony=20

saw that she was trembling.  "Come and sit down," he said. "Something's wro=
ng, I can see. What=20

is it?"  But she stood where she was, looking at him with large, tragic eye=
s; laid down a leather=20

despatch-case she was carrying, and seized the edge of the table as if for =
support.  "I'd rather not=20

sit down yet," she said. "Perhaps when you've heard what I've got to tell y=
ou, you'll never want me=20

to sit down in your house again ... and yet ... I did pray so you'd be here=
 ... I knew it was most=20

unlikely ... but I did pray so ... And you _are_ here."  Anthony was puzzle=
d. Meg was not given to=20

making scenes or going into heroics.  It was evident that something had hap=
pened to shake her=20

out of her usual almost cynical calm.  "You'd be much better to sit down," =
he said, soothingly. "You=20



see, if you stand, so must I, and it's such an uncomfortable way of talking=
."  She pulled out a chair=20

and sat down at the table, took off her gloves, and two absurd small thumbs=
 appeared above its=20

edge, the knuckles white and tense with the strength of her grip.  Anthony =
seated himself in a=20

deep chair beside the fireplace. He was in shadow. Meg faced the light, and=
 he was shocked at=20

the appearance of the little smitten face.  "Now tell me," he said gently, =
"just as little or as much as=20

you like."  "This morning," she said hoarsely, "I ran away with a man ... i=
n a motor-car."  Anthony=20

was certainly startled, but all he said was, "That being the case, why are =
you here, my dear, and=20

what have you done with him?"  "He was married...."  "Have you only just fo=
und that out?"  "No, I=20

knew it all along. His wife is hard and disagreeable and older than he is .=
.. and he's thirty-five ...=20

and they can't live together, and she won't divorce him and he can't divorc=
e her ... and I loved him=20

so much and thought how beautiful it would be to give up everything and mak=
e it up to him."=20

"Yes?" said Anthony, for Meg paused as though unable to go on.  "And it see=
med very wonderful=20

and noble to do this, and I forgot my poor little Papa and those boys in In=
dia, and you and Jan and=20

Fay and ... I was very mad and very happy ... till this morning, when we ac=
tually went off in his=20

car."  "But where," Anthony asked in a voice studiously even and quiet, "_a=
re_ he and his car?"  "I=20

don't know," Meg said hopelessly, "unless they're still at the place where =
we had lunch ... and I=20

don't suppose he'd stay there all this time...."  Anthony felt a great desi=
re to laugh, but Meg looked=20

so woebegone and desperately serious that he restrained the impulse and sai=
d very kindly: "I don't=20

yet understand how, having embarked upon such an enterprise, you happen to =
be here ... alone.=20

Did you quarrel at lunch, or what?"  "We didn't _have_ lunch," Meg exclaime=
d with a sob. "At least,=20

I didn't ... it was the lunch that did it."  "Did what?"  "Made me realise =
what I had done, and go=20

away."  "Meg dear," said Anthony, striving desperately to keep his voice st=
eady, "was it a very bad=20

lunch?"  "I don't know," she answered with the utmost seriousness. "We hadn=
't begun; we were=20

eaching from the=20

green vales of earth to the blue vaults of heaven. Silhouetted against the =
sky in the hazy distance,=20

they are noted by the westward bound traveler as soon as he reaches the hig=
hest point in the=20

divide of the Rockies, while to the mariner groping his way eastward upon t=
he Pacific Ocean they=20

offer the first evidence of the nearness of the welcome land.  These mounta=
ins mean much to the=20

state of Washington, both for their scenic grandeur and for the favorable i=
nfluence they exert on=20

the climate and on the lives of the people who build their homes in the val=
leys below. Their=20

supremacy is reflected by the thermometer, the barometer, and the aerometer=
; for they help=20

regulate the temperature, the rainfall, and the wind's velocity. They form =
great repositories for the=20

waters that feed the streams and keep full the cities' aqueducts. Within th=
eir immeasurable depths=20

lie buried huge deposits of precious and useful metals, besides vast fields=
 of bituminous coal.=20

e in her hands.  Anthony=20

made no sound, and presently, still with hidden face, she went on again:  "=
And in that minute I saw=20

what I was doing, and that I could never be the same again, and I remembere=
d my poor little=20

_all_ the special people I pray for every single night and morning--and I f=
elt that if I didn't get away=20

imple. There was=20

something wrong with the car (that's how he got his hands so dirty), and he=
'd sent for a mechanic,=20

and just as we were sitting down to lunch, the waiter said the motor-man ha=
d come ... and he went=20

out to the garage to speak to him...."  "Yes?" Anthony remarked, for again =
Meg paused.  "So I just=20

walked out of the front door. No one saw me, and the station was across the=
 road, and I went right=20

in and asked when there was a train to London, and there _was_ one going in=
 five minutes; so I=20

took a ticket and came straight here, for I knew somehow, even if you were =
all away, Hannah=20

would let me stay ... just to-night. I knew she would ..." and Meg began to=
 sob feebly.  And, as if in=20

response to the mention of her name, Hannah appeared, bearing a tray with t=
ea upon it. Hannah=20

was short and square; she stumped as she walked, and she carried a tray ver=
y high and stately,=20

as though it were a sacrifice. As she came in Meg rose and hastily moved to=
 the window, standing=20

there with her back to the room.  "I thocht," said Hannah, as though challe=
nging somebody to=20

contradict her, "that Miss Morton would be the better for an egg to her tea=
. She looks just like a bit=20

soap after a hard day's washing."  "I had no lunch," said a muffled, apolog=
etic voice from the=20



window.  "Come away, then, and take yer tea," Hannah said sharply. "Young l=
eddies should have=20

more sense than go fasting so many hours."  As it was evident that Hannah h=
ad no intention of=20

leaving the room till she saw Meg sitting at the table, the girl came back =
and sat down.  "See that=20

she gets her tea, sir," she said in a low,=20


_
prowling huntsmen. Still higher are the rugged bare prominences, reserved f=
or the wild goat or=20

mountain sheep, and the snow fields traversed by the more venturesome seeki=
ng to gain the=20

summits. Everywhere the true sportsman finds ample opportunity for proving =
his prowess, while=20

trailing the beast to its lair, and the sight-seeking mountaineer is fully =
rewarded for all the struggle=20

required to reach some dizzy height.  [Illustration: A GLIMPSE FROM PACK CR=

itself over some lofty=20

tains are a link=20

connecting us with the past. They remind us perhaps of the period when volc=
anoes belched forth=20

their fiery refuse, or of the era when the sea covered Anthony. "She's pret=
ty far through."  The tray=20

was set at the end of the table. Anthony came and sat down behind it.  "I'l=
l pour out," he said, "and=20

until you've drunk one cup of tea, eaten one piece of bread-and-butter and =
one egg, you're not to=20

speak one word. _I_ will talk."  He tried to, disjointedly and for the most=
 part nonsense. Meg drank=20

her tea, and to her own amazement ate up her egg and several pieces of brea=
d-and-butter with=20

the utmost relish.  As the meal proceeded, Anthony noted that she grew less=
 haggard. The tears=20

still hung on her eyelashes, but the eyes themselves were a thought less tr=
agic.  When Hannah=20

came for the tray she gave a grunt of satisfaction at the sight of the egg-=
shell and the empty=20

plates.  "Now," said Anthony, "we must thresh this subject out and settle w=

nge possesses its=20

own distinct characteristics. Of least importance, but none the less beauti=
ful, are the Blue=20

Mountains in the southeastern corner of the state, providing pleasant summe=
r retreats for the=20

people in that vicinity. The Olympic range practically envelopes the Olympi=
c Peninsula and all but=20

encroaches upon the agricultural lands lying between the foothills and the =
salt waters on three=20

sides. In this range are the most rugged mountains in Washington, presentin=
g some of the wildest=20

and most inspiring scenery anywhere to be found.  Most prominent and of gre=
atest importance in=20

the geography of the state are the Cascades, having an average altitude of =
from 5,000 to 8,000=20

feet and named for the many hurrying streams that have cut their deep cours=
es upon the shady=20

slopes. They extend from the British Columbia line slightly southwest until=
 divided by the Columbia=20

river, whence they continue through Oregon and become the Sierra Nevadas of=
 California. By=20

them the state of Washington is separated into two quite distinct parts, kn=
own as Eastern and=20

Western Washington, the former comprising a portion of the great Inland Emp=
ire. Forming a sort of=20

spur on their east side, north of the Columbia, and extending to the mounta=
ins of Idaho are the=20

beautiful rolling hills known as the Okanogan Highlands from 5,000 to 6,000=
 feet in altitude without=20

sharp abrupt prominences and bearing on their higher surfaces forests of pi=
ne.  Throughout the=20

Cascade range several prominent peaks tower above the others like giants am=
ong dwarfs. The=20

loftiest by far is Mount Rainier (or Mount Tacoma), second highest mountain=
 in the United States=20

proper, 14,408 feet in altitude and the chief mountain resort out of Seattl=
e and Tacoma; Mount=20

Adams, 12,307 feet, on the boundary line of Skamania and Yakima counties; M=
ount St. Helens,=20

9,697 feet high, at the western edge of Skamania county, reached from Castl=
e Rock or=20

Vancouver; Mount Baker, 10,730 feet, forty miles from Bellingham and one of=
 its main attractions;=20

Mount Stuart, 9,470 feet, in Chelan county; and Glacier Peak, 10,436 feet, =
in Snohomish county.=20

In this latitude 7,500 feet is the snow-line, but Washington has many peaks=
 above that elevation.=20

Fifty-seven have already been named and measured.  All these peaks are acce=
ssible and,=20

together with Mount Olympus in the Olympics, constitute the main goals of t=
he mountain loving=20

clubs of the northwest. Mountain phenomena are displayed in all with a maxi=

Doubtless it did," said=20

Anthony drily. "But we must consider what is to be done now. If you said yo=
u were going to your=20

father, perhaps the best thing you can do is to go to him, and write to the=
 Trents from there. I hope=20

write to him just before we=20

look for me ... I expect he is awfully puzzled."  "I expect he is, and I ho=

vindictively, "the fellow is terrified out of his life as well. He ought to=
 be horsewhipped, and I'd like=20

to do it. A babe like you!"  "No," said Meg, firmly; "there you're wrong. I=
'm not a babe ... I knew=20

what I was doing; but up to to-day it seemed worth it ... I never seemed to=
 see till to-day how it=20

would hurt other people. Even if he grew tired of me--and I had faced that-=
-there would have been=20

some awfully happy months ... and so long as it was only me, it didn't seem=
 to matter. And when=20

you've had rather a mouldy life...."  "It can never be a case of 'only me.'=
 As society is constituted,=20

other people are always involved."  "Yet there was Marian Evans ... he told=
 me about her ... she=20

did it, and everyone came round to think it was very fine of her really. Sh=
e wrote, or something,=20

didn't she?"  "She did," said Anthony, "and in several other respects her c=
ase was not at all=20

analogous to yours. She was a middle-aged woman--you are a child...."  "Per=
haps, but I'm not an=20

ignorant child...."  "Oh, Meg!" Anthony protested.  "I daresay about books =
and things I am, but I=20

mean I haven't been wrapped in cotton-wool, and taken care of all my life, =
like Jan and Fay ... I=20

know about things. Oh dear, oh dear, will you forbid Jan ever to speak to m=
e again?"  "Jan!"=20

Anthony repeated. "Jan! Why, she's the person of all others we want. We'll =
do nothing till she's=20

here. Let's get her." And he pushed back his chair and rushed to the bell. =
 Meg rushed after him:=20

"You'll let her see me? You'll let her talk to me? Oh, are you sure?"  The =
little hands clutched his=20

arm, her ravaged, wistful face was raised imploringly to his.  Anthony stoo=
ped and kissed the little=20

face.  "It's just people like Jan who are put into the world to straighten =
things out for the rest of us.=20

We've wasted three-quarters of an hour already. Now we'll get her."  "Is sh=
e on the telephone?"=20

asked the practical Meg. "Not far off?"         *       *       *       *  =
     *  Jan was quite used to being=20

summoned to her father in a tremendous hurry. She was back in St. George's =
Square before he=20



started for the dinner. Meg was lying down in one of the dismantled bedroom=
s, and when Jan=20

arrived she went straight to her father in his dressing-room.  She found hi=
m on his knees, pursuing=20

a refractory collar-stud under the wash-stand.  "It's well you've come," he=
 said as he got up. "I=20

can't fasten my collar or my tie. I've had a devil of a time. My fingers ar=
e all thumbs and I'm most=20

detestably sticky."  He told Jan about Meg. She fastened his collar and arr=
anged his tie in the=20

neatest of bows. Then she kissed him on both cheeks and told him not to wor=
ry.  "How can one=20

refrain from worrying when the works of the devil and the selfishness of ma=
n are made manifest as=20

they have been to-day? But for the infinite mercy of God, where would that =
poor silly child have=20

been?"  "It's just because the infinite mercy of God is so much stronger th=
an the works of the devil=20

or the selfishness of man, that you needn't worry," said Jan.  Anthony put =
his hands on Jan's=20

shoulders and held her away from him.  "Do you know," he said, "I shall alw=
ays like Hannah better=20

after this. In spite of her moustache and her grimness, that child was sure=
 Hannah would take her=20

in, whether any of us were here or not. Now, how did she know?"  "Because,"=
 said Jan, "things are=20

revealed to babes like Meg that are hidden from men of the world like you. =
Hannah is all right--you=20

don't appreciate Hannah, and you are rather jealous of her moustache."  Ant=
hony leant forward=20

and kissed his tall young daughter: "You are a great comfort, Jan," he said=
. "How do you do it?"=20

Jan nodded at him. "It will all straighten out--don't you worry," she said.=
  All the same, there was=20

plenty of worry for everybody. The man, after his fashion, was very much in=
 love with Meg. He was=20

horribly alarmed by her sudden and mysterious disappearance. No one had see=
n her go, no one=20

had noticed her.  He got into a panic, and motored back to the Trents', arr=
iving there just before=20

dinner. Mrs. Trent, tired and cross after a wet picnic, had, of course, rea=
d Meg's note, thought it=20

very casual of the girl and was justly incensed.  On finding they knew no m=
ore of Meg's=20

movements than he did himself, the man--one Walter Brooke--lost his head an=
d confessed the=20

truth to Mrs. Trent, who was much shocked and not a little frightened.  Lat=

received a telegram from=20

Washington can be best realized by climbing to one of the heights overlooki=
ng the timber line.=20

From here one can readily see how perfectly it hides every blemish of the i=
rregular contour,=20

blending beautifully with whereabouts.  Jan had insisted on this, lest the =
Trents should suspect=20

anything and wire to Major Morton.  Mrs. Trent, quite naturally, refused to=
 have anything further to=20

do with Meg. She talked of serpents, and was very much upset. She wrote a d=
ignified letter to=20

Major Morton, explaining her reasons for Meg's dismissal. She also wrote to=
 their relative among=20

the weariful rich, through whom she had heard of Meg.  Meg was more under a=

she left Ribston Hall.  But for Jan and=20

Thousands of greenish tints are distinguishable, shading from a light yello=

contrast.  Leaving the point of vantage, however, to delve into its midst, =
breathing in the aromatic=20

odors from the balsams and cedars, it is easy to note hundreds of interesti=
ng distinctions in size,=20

form, color, and variety, for            "No tree in all the grove but has =
its charms,            Though each=20

its hue peculiar."  One should know, too, that he is buried in one of the d=
ensest forests of the=20

 which for size can be=20

duplicated nowhere else in the world, excepting by occasional specimens of =
the famous Red=20

faithfully with the man, who went yachting at once.  Meg recovered her pois=
e, searched the=20

advertisements of the scholastic papers industriously, and secured a post i=
n a school for little=20

boys, as Anthony forced his cousin Amelia to give her a testimonial.  Here =
she worked hard and=20

was a great success, for she could keep order, and that quality, where smal=
l boys are concerned,=20

is much more valuable than learning. She stayed there for some years, and t=
hen her frail little ill-

nourished body gave out, and she was gravely ill.  When she recovered, she =
went as English=20

termination she was free to offer to meet Jan and her charges.     CHAPTER =
