accompanied by Sergeant Donald Hackett, Carlo saluted and stood at attentio=
n. When they had=20

gone past he turned once more to Bianca, his slight attack of bad temper ha=
ving vanished.  "Not=20

jealous, are you, Bee? You must realize that whatever friendships I may mak=
e, I shall always be=20

fond of you."  If Carlo had been noticing his companion at this moment, he =
would have seen that=20

Bianca flushed credulous enough to believe him," Melroy replied. "And that =
tends to confirm the=20

results of the tests they failed to pass."  "Oh, so that's the line you're =
taking. You persecute a man,=20

and then say he has a persecution complex if he recognizes the fact. Well, =
you're not going to get=20

away with it, that's all I have to say to you." Crandall flung the test-she=
et he had been holding on to=20

the desk.=20


_
extremely angry, and few people ever saw Bianca angry, not perhaps because =
she did not feel the=20

emotion of anger, but because she possessed a rather remarkable self contro=
l.  "I don't think we=20

will discuss the question of my being jealous, Carlo, you have scarcely the=
 right to believe that I=20

care for you enough for any such absurdity. I don't like Miss Thompson very=
 much and neither=20

does Sonya. Oh, there is no real reason for disliking her! But if you are u=
nder the impression that=20

she likes not worth the paper it's scribbled on!" He turned on his heel in =
an automatically correct=20

about-face and strode out of the office.         *       *       *       * =
      *  Melroy straightened out the=20

papers and put them away, then sat down at his desk, filling and lighting h=
is pipe. He was still=20

working at 1215 when Ben Puryear called him.  "They walked out on us," he r=
eported. "Harry=20

Crandall was out here talking to them, and at noon the whole gang handed in=
 their wrist-Geigers=20

and=20


_
you are mistaken. She just likes to amuse herself too, and of course there =
is no harm in it."=20

Bianca's speech sounded perfectly childlike and yet perhaps she had a good =
deal of instinctive=20

cleverness.  In any case Carlo felt annoyed.  "But suppose we don't talk pe=
rsonalities any more,=20

Carlo," Bianca apologized almost immediately. "Naturally we can't always li=
ke the same people. I=20

have never been able to get over my disappointment because the Countess Cha=
rlotta was not=20

allowed to come with us to Coblenz. Sonya and I have nearly quarreled about=
 her half a dozen=20

times. And I suppose it is not alone that I am sorry for the Countess Charl=
otta, but because I do=20

need a girl friend so dreadfully, Carlo. It seems strange doesn't it, and I=
 am almost ashamed to=20

speak of it, but I have never had a really intimate girl friend in my life.=
 I suppose this may be partly=20

due to the queer circumstances of my life. You see with my father dead and =
my mother an Italian=20

peasant, who wished to make my life so different from her own that I was no=
t allowed to associate=20

even with her very closely, and then being brought up by a foster mother wh=
o did not encourage=20

other girls to make friends with me, because she might have to tell them of=
 my peculiar history, I=20

suppose I did not have much of a chance for friendships with the kind of gi=
rls I would like to have=20

known! Then I realize that I have not a very attractive disposition."  Bian=
ca's little unconscious=20

confession of loneliness had its instantaneous effect upon her companion.  =
"Don't be a goose,=20

Bianca mia," Carlo answered, using an Italian phrase which he sometimes emp=
loyed, recalling the=20

bond of their first meeting in Italy several years before. "But who is this=
 Countess Charlotta whom=20

you desire to have with you here in Coblenz in order that you may they aren=
't coming back till=20

Burris and Koffler come back to work with them."  "Then they aren't coming =
back, period," Melroy=20

replied. "Crandall was to see me, a couple of hours ago. He tells me that B=
urris and Koffler told=20

him that we've been persecuting Burris; discriminating against him. You kno=
w of anything that=20

really happened that might make them think anything like that?"  "No. Burri=
s is always yelling=20

about not getting enough overtime work, but you know how it is: he's just a=
 roustabout, a common=20

laborer. Any overtime work that has to be done is usually skilled labor on =
this job. We generally=20

have a few roustabouts to help out, but he's been allowed to make overtime =
as much as any of the=20

others."  "Will the time-records show that?"  "They ought to. I don't know =
what he and Koffler told=20

Crandall, but whatever it was, I'll bet they were lying."  "That's all righ=
t, then. How's the reactor,=20

now?"  "Hausinger says the count's down to safe limits, and the temperature=
's down to inactive=20

normal. He and his gang found a big chunk of plutonium, about one-quarter C=
M, inside. He got it=20

out."  "All right. Tell Dr. Rives to gather up all her completed or partial=
ly completed test records and=20

come out to the office. You and the others stay on the job; we may have som=
e men for you by this=20

afternoon; tomorrow morning certainly."  He hung up, then picked up the com=
municator phone and=20

called his secretary.  "Joan, is Sid Keating out there? Send him in, will y=
ou?"  Keating, when he=20

entered, was wearing the lugubriously gratified expression appropriate to t=
he successful prophet of=20

disaster.  "All right, Cassandra," Melroy greeted him. "I'm not going to sa=
y you didn't warn me.=20

Look. This strike is illegal. It's a violation of the Federal Labor Act of =
1958, being called without=20

_
Just an instant Bianca appeared troubled and then her expression cleared.  =
"Perhaps I should not=20

have spoken of the Countess Charlotta, not even to you, Carlo, only of cour=
se I know I can trust=20

you. She was a young girl who was ill in our temporary hospital in Luxembur=
g. I thought of course=20

she would write me, as she without preliminary negotiation, and without two=
 weeks' time-

allowance."  "They're going to claim that it isn't a strike. They're going =
to call it a 'spontaneous=20

work-stoppage.'"  "Aah! I hope I can get Crandall on record to that effect;=
 I'll fire every one of those=20

men for leaving their work without permission and=20
