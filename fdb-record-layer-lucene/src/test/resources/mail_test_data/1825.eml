Saturday morning Mr. Carson returned to Capri in a sailing vessel, having taken advantage of a 

night crossing and arriving with the dawn. Lorna had bidden her friends a temporary good-by for 

the week-end, refusing all kind invitations of "bring your father to see us," or "tell him he must join 

the Clan." She felt that her excuses for him were of the flimsiest; she said he was tired, unwell, 

and needed absolute rest and solitude, and begged them to forgive her if she spent the time with 

him alone, and, though they replied that they could understand his desire for quiet, she was 

conscious that they thought she might at least have volunteered an introduction. Lorna knew only 

too well that, if her father was aware there was the slightest danger of meeting English people, he 

would probably insist upon taking the next boat back to Naples; it was the consciousness of 

complete isolation that gave the value to his holiday. She told him indeed that she had met some 

of her school friends and had taken walks with them, but she mentioned that they were staying 

down below, nearer the Marina, and that they were not in the least likely to come up to the Casa 

Verdi.  "Let us take our books, Daddy," she suggested, "and go and sit on the hillside as we did 

last Sunday. It was quiet on that ledge of the crag, and away from everybody. The rest did you 

good, and I'm sure you enjoyed it."  Lying on the cliff among the flowers, with blue sky above and 

blue sea beneath, poor Mr. Carson allowed himself a temporary relaxation. He smoked his pipe 

and read his paper, and for a little while at least the hard lines round his mouth softened, and his 

anxious eyes grew easy. He finished his Italian journal, lay idly watching the scenery, chatted, 

dozed, and finally stretched out his hand for one of Lorna's books. It happened to be an Anthology 

of Poetry which not more considerable. The savannahs of Lower Louisiana everywhere remind us 

of the savannahs of the Lower Orinoco.  During our stay of three days in the little town of San 

Fernando, we lodged with the Capuchin missionary, who lived much at his ease. We were 

recommended to him by the bishop of Caracas, and he showed us the most obliging attention. He 

consulted me on the works that had been undertaken to prevent the flood from undermining the 

shore on which the town was built. The flowing of the Portuguesa into the Apure gives the latter an 

impulse towards south-east; and, instead of procuring a freer course for the river, attempts were 

made to confine it by dykes and piers. It was easy to predict that these would be rapidly destroyed 

by the swell of the waters, the shore having been weakened by taking away the earth from behind 

the dyke to employ it in these hydraulic constructions.  San Fernando is celebrated for the 

excessive heat which prevails there the greater part of the year; and before I begin the recital of 

our long navigation on the rivers, I shall relate some facts calculated to throw light on the 

meteorology of the tropics. We went, provided with thermometers, to the flat shores covered with 

white sand which border the river Apure. At two in the afternoon I found the sand, wherever it was 

exposed to the sun, at 52.5 degrees. The instrument, raised eighteen inches above the sand, 

marked 42.8 degrees, and at six feet high 38.7 degrees. The temperature of the air under the 

shade of a ceiba was 36.2 degrees. These observations were made during a dead calm. As soon 

as the wind began to blow, the temperature of the air rose 3 degrees higher, yet we were not 

enveloped by a wind of sand, but the strata of air had been in contact with a soil more strongly 

heated, or through which whirlwinds of sand had passed. This western part of the Llanos is the 

hottest, because it receives air that has already crossed the rest of

which contained one of the ballads that Mrs. Cameron had recited to the assembled Clan. It had 

struck Lorna's fancy, and she was trying to learn it by heart. Mr. Carson turned over the pages, 

read a few of the pieces, and was closing the little volume when his eye chanced to light upon the 

name written on the title page. Its effect upon him was like a charge of electricity.  "David 

Beverley," he gasped. "David Beverley! Lorna! Great Heavens! By all that's sacred, where did you 

get been observed between the eastern and western parts of the deserts of Africa, where the 

trade-winds blow.  The heat augments sensibly in the Llanos during the rainy season, particularly 

in the month of July, when the sky is cloudy, and reflects the radiant heat toward the earth. During 

this season the breeze entirely ceases; and, according to good thermometrical observations made 

by M. Pozo, the thermometer rises in the shade to 39 and 39.5 degrees, though kept at the 

distance of
