[821] The subjective symptoms _
of the Neo-Platonists.   No danger whatever, of course, for the simple reas=
on that the modern=20

commentators have never had the key to Occult interpretations. And before a=
nother word is said in=20

defence of Plato and the Neoplatonists, the learned master of Balliol Colle=
ge ought to be=20

respectfully asked: What does, or can he know of the Esoteric canon of inte=
rpretation? By the term=20

"canon" is here meant that key which was communicated orally from "mouth to=
 ear" by the Master=20

to the disciple, or by the Hierophant to the candidate for initiation; this=
 from time immemorial=20

throughout a long series of ages, during which the inner--not public--Myste=
ries were the most=20

sacred institution of every land. Without such a key no correct interpretat=
ion of either the=20

_Dialogues_ of Plato or any Scripture, from the _Vedas_ to Homer, from the =
_Zend Avesta_ to the=20

Mosaic Books, is possible. How then can the Rev. Dr. Jowett know that the i=
nterpretations made=20

by the Neoplatonists of the various sacred books of the nations were "absur=
dities?" Where, again,=20

has he found an opportunity of studying these "interpretations"? History sh=
ows that all such works=20

were destroyed by the Christian Church Fathers and their fanatical catechum=
ens, wherever they=20

were found. To say that such men as Ammonius, a genius and a saint, whose l=
earning and holy=20

life earned for him the title of Theodidaktos ("God- taught"), such men as =
Plotinus, Porphyry, and=20

Proclus, were "incapable of distinguishing between the opinions of one phil=
osopher and another,=20

or between the serious thoughts of Plato and his fancies," is to assume an =
untenable position for a=20

Scholar. It amounts to saying that, (_a_) scores of the most famous Philoso=
phers, the greatest=20

Scholars and Sages of Greece and of the Roman Empire were dull fools, and (=
_b_) that all the=20

other commentators, lovers of Greek Philosophy, some of them the acutest in=
tellects of the age--

who do not agree with Dr. Jowett--are also fools and no better than those w=
hom they admire. The=20

patronising tone of the last above-quoted passage is modulated with the mos=
t _naive_ conceit,=20

remarkable even in our age of self-glorification and mutual-admiration cliq=
ues. We have to=20

compare the Professor's views with those of some other scholars.  Says Prof=
. Alexander Wilder of=20

New York, one of the best Platonists of the day, speaking of Ammonius, the =
founder of the=20

Neoplatonic School:       His deep spiritual intuition, his extensive learn=
ing, his     familiarity with the=20

Christian Fathers, Pantaenus, Clement, and     Athenagoras, and with the mo=
st erudite=20

philosophers of the time,     all fitted him for the labour which he perfor=
med so     thoroughly.(13)=20

He was successful in drawing to his views the     greatest scholars and pub=
lic men of the Roman=20

Empire, who had     little taste for wasting time in  were full. The lungs =
of the first were dry and=20

uniformly red; of the  second were resisting, crepitant, and quite =C5=93de=
matous. No subpleural=20

ecchymoses in either. The experiments on animals by Corin[812] led  him to =
conclude that=20

pressure on the pneumogastrics caused increased  frequency of the heart-bea=
t and slowing of=20

respiration. Pellier[813]  considers the subject quite fully. It would appe=
ar that the pressure  on the=20

pneumogastrics disposes to stop the action of the heart and  cause rapid, p=
erhaps instant death.=20

The pressure on the carotids  causes cerebral an=C3=A6mia and is then only =
a secondary cause.=20

Levy[814]  does not think the action of the pneumogastrics is sufficiently =
well  known.  Tidy states=20

that a dog lived for three hours suspended by a rope placed above an openin=
g in the windpipe;=20

and that Smith[815] mentions the case of a criminal who was hung; Chovet tr=
ied to save the man=20

by making an opening in the trachea before the execution and introducing a =
small tube. The man=20

was alive forty-five minutes after the drop, but could not be resuscitated,=
 although the surgeon=20

bled him.  In a small proportion of cases of hanging, homicidal and judicia=
l, death occurs by=20



dislocation of the spine. This is said to have been first noticed by the ce=
lebrated Louis, who states=20

that the Paris executioner was in the habit of giving a violent rotary move=
ment to the body of the=20

convict as the trap was sprung, causing a dislocation of the odontoid proce=
ss and compression of=20

the cord and almost instant death. Taylor[816] says that for dislocation th=
e body must be heavy=20

and the fall long and sudden. Devergie[817] found this to occur in about tw=
o per cent of cases. It is=20

said that the Paris hangman placed the slip-knot under the chin in front, w=
hich is as Dr. Haughton=20

suggests.  Death may occur from secondary causes after apparent recovery; f=
rom congestion of=20

brain and other lesions of the nervous system; these may prove fatal at rem=
ote periods.  Fracture=20

of the odontoid process according to M. de Fosse is more common than disloc=
ation, and the giving=20

away of the intervertebral substance more likely than either of the others.=
 The phrenic and other=20

respiratory nerves are likely to be paralyzed; the vertebral and carotid ar=
teries may be ruptured.=20

The medulla oblongata is also likely to be fatally injured. Death may also =
occur from hemorrhage=20

upon the cord, causing pressure.  Besides the ropes used as ligatures in ju=
dicial hanging, almost=20

every conceivable article that could be made into the semblance of a cord h=
as been used by=20

suicides; usually, however, some portion of the bedding or clothing. When o=
ne resolves on=20

suicide, all the precautions of the managers of prisons and asylums fail to=
 prevent.  The secondary=20

effects in those who recover involve the respiratory organs=E2=80=94dyspn=
=C5=93a, cough, bloody sputa,=20


_
superstitious observances. The results of his ministration are     percepti=
ble at the present day in=20

every country of the Christian     world; every prominent system of doctrin=
e now bearing the marks=20

of     his plastic hand. Every ancient philosophy has had its votaries     =
among the moderns; and=20

even Judaism ... has taken upon itself     changes which were suggested by =
the "God-taught"=20

Alexandrian....     He was a man of rare learning and endowments, of blamel=
ess life     and=20

amiable disposition. His almost superhuman ken and many     excellencies wo=
n for him the title of=20

Theodidaktos; but he     followed the modest example of Pythagoras, and onl=
y assumed the     title=20

of Philalethian, or lover of truth.(14)   It would be happy for truth and f=
act were our modern=20

scholars to follow as modestly in the steps of their great predecessors. Bu=
t not they--Philalethians!=20

Moreover, we know that:       Like Orpheus, Pythagoras, Confucius, Socrates=
, and Jesus=20

himself,(15) Ammonius committed nothing to writing.(16) Instead he     ... =
communicated his most=20

important doctrines to persons duly     instructed and disciplined, imposin=
g on them the obligations=20

of     secresy, as was done before him by Zoroaster and Pythagoras, and    =
 in the Mysteries.=20

Except a few treatises of his disciples we have     only the declarations o=
f his adversaries from=20

which to ascertain     what he actually taught.(17) or the nervous system=
=E2=80=94aphonia, dysphagia,=20

numbness, chilliness, spasms, pains in neck, face, or shoulder; sometimes p=
aralysis of bladder=20

and rectum, and loss of memory. The marks on the neck slowly disappear.[818=
] Verse[819]=20

collated a number of cases in which the hanging was not completed and the s=
ubjects lived for=20

varying periods afterward. Wagner and M=C3=B6bius[820] discuss the spasmodi=
c seizures and amnesia,=20

which often appear after the restoration from hanging.   SYMPTOMS IN HANGIN=
G.  Obviously=20

these will be in some respects identical with those of strangulation. In co=
nsidering the latter, some=20

of the similarities and dissimilarities of symptoms and post-mortem appeara=
nces of strangulation=20

and hanging were mentioned.  Death may be immediate and without symptoms.  =
There is, of=20

course, no preliminary or =E2=80=9Cwaiting=E2=80=9D stage, as in strangulat=
ion, except in those rare cases of suicide=20

where the subject inclines his body forward with his neck against the ligat=
ure, his body being near=20

the floor or ground. The absence of a drop makes this condition very simila=
r to ordinary=20

strangulation. The body of a victim of homicide might be similarly placed f=
or the purpose of=20

deception, and also that of a subject previously made unconscious; in these=
 cases the symptoms=20

and appearances would resemble those of strangulation.  In other words it i=
s necessary that there=20

should be a drop or fall, or at least the weight=20


_
It is from the biassed statements of such "adversaries," probably, that the=
 learned Oxford=20

translator of Plato's Dialogues came to the conclusion that:       That whi=
ch was truly great and=20

truly characteristic of him     [Plato], his effort to realise and connect =
abstractions, _was not=20

understood_ by them [the Neoplatonists] at all [?].   He states, contemptuo=
usly enough for the=20

hanging. The jerk of the fall or sudden dependence of the body upon the lig=
ature causes a much=20

greater constriction of the ligature on the neck, and in a different direct=
ion, than in strangulation;=20

and also a much greater pressure on the blood-vessels and nerves of the nec=
k.  Tidy divides=20

hanging into three stages:  First stage: Partial stupor lasting thirty seco=
nds to three minutes,=20
