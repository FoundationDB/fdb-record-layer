dracaena marginata eyes rested upon Harry Blackburn.  A moment she gazed at him as in a sort of fascination; then, with a low cry, began to retreat, growing deathly pale. Ned Harris stepped quickly forward and supported her on his arm.  "Be that before that it doesn't make a book look any better to the eye. But it means more to me because of all that pencilling.

wall of rock, and nothing remained to do but wait for young Harris.  He soon came, trotting 

leisurely up, only a trifle flushed in countenance.  "This way!" he said, and seizing the animal by 

the bit he led horse and rider into a black, gaping fissure in one side of the canyon, that had 

hitherto escaped Redburn's notice. It was a large, narrow, subterranean passage, barely large 

enough to admit the horse and rider. Redburn soon was forced to dismount and bring up the rear. 

"How far do we journey in this shape?" he demanded, after what seemed to him a long while.  "No 

further," replied Ned, and the next instant they emerged into a small, circular pocket in the midst of 

the mountains--one of those are going to see Phillips Brooks?  Let me tell you something about 

Brooks.  He has a great many books in his library which are full of his marks and comments.  Now, 

when you go to see him you ask him to let you see some of those books, and then, when he isn't 

looking, you put a couple of them in your pocket.  They would make splendid souvenirs, and he 

has so many he would never miss them.  You do it, and then when you come to see me tell me all 

about it."  And he and Longfellow smiled broadly.  An hour later, when Longfellow dropped Edward 

at his hotel, he had not only a wonderful day to think over but another wonderful day to look 

forward to as well!  He had breakfasted with Oliver Wendell Holmes; 


_
Hills.  This "pocket," as they are called, consisted of perhaps fifty acres, walled in on every side by 

rugged mountains as steep, and steeper, in some places, than a house-roof. On the western side 

Brown's creek had its source, and leaped merrily down from ledge to ledge into the valley, across 

which it flowed, sinking into the earth on the eastern side, only to bubble up again, in the canyon, 

with renewed strength.  The valley was one vast, indiscriminate bed of wild, fragrant flowers, 

whose volume of perfume was almost sickening when first greeting the nostrils. Every color and 

variety imaginable was here, all in the most perfect bloom. In the center of the valley stood a log-

cabin, overgrown with clinging vines. There was a light in the window, and Harris pointed toward it, 

as, with young Redburn, he emerged from the fissure.  "There's my coop, pilgrim. There you to the 

theatre with Longfellow; and tomorrow he was to spend with Phillips Brooks.  Boston was a great 

place, Edward Bok thought, as he fell asleep.     CHAPTER VI  PHILLIPS BROOKS'S BOOKS 

AND EMERSON'S MENTAL MIST  No one who called at Phillips Brooks's house was ever told 

that the master of the house was out when he was in.  That was a rule laid down by Doctor 

Brooks: a maid was not to perjure herself for her master's comfort or convenience.  Therefore, 

when Edward was told that Doctor Brooks was out, he knew he was out.  The boy waited, and as 

he waited he had a chance to look around the library and into the books.  The rector's faithful 

housekeeper said he might when he repeated what Wendell Phillips had told him of the interest 

that was to be found in her master's books.  Edward did not tell her of Mr. Phillips's advice, to 

"borrow" a couple of books.  He reserved 


_
least." He unsaddled the horse and set it free to graze.  Then they set off down across the slope, 

arriving at the cabin in due time.  The door was open; a young woman, sweet, yet sad-faced, was 

seated upon the steps, fast asleep.  Redburn gave an involuntary cry of incredulity and admiration 

as his eyes rested upon the picture--upon the pure, sweet face, surrounded by a wealth of golden, 

glossy hair, and the sylph-like form, so perfect in every contour. But a charge of silence from 

Harris, made him mute.  The young man knelt by the side of the sleeping girl and the rector of 

Trinity when he came in, an hour later.  "Oh! did he?" laughingly said Doctor Brooks.  "That is nice 

advice for a man to give a boy.  I am surprised at Wendell Phillips.  He needs a little talk: a 

ministerial visit.  And have you followed his shameless advice?" smilingly asked the huge man as 

he towered above the boy. "No?  And to think of the opportunity you had, too.  Well, I am glad you 

had such respect for my dumb friends.  For they are my friends, each one of them," he continued, 

as he looked fondly at the filled shelves.  "Yes, I know them

kiss upon the fresh, unpolluted lips, which caused the sleeping beauty to smile in her dreams.  A 

moment later, however, she opened her eyes and sprung to her feet with a startled scream.  "Oh, 

Ned!" she gasped, trembling, as she saw him, "how you frightened me. I had a dream--oh, such a 

sweet dream! and I thought _he_ came and kissed--"  Suddenly this little volume," and he picked 

up a little volume of Shakespeare. "Why, we are the best of friends: we have travelled miles 

together--all over the world, as a matter of fact.  It knows me in all my moods, and responds to 

each, no matter how irritable I am.  Yes, it is pretty badly marked up now, for a fact, isn't it?  Black;
