he mother replace everything as it had been and satisfied himself that the =
_
precious jewels they contain, are all due to the patient labours of the mod=
ern man of Science. And=20

is it not to the unparalleled genius of the latter that the ignorant and hi=
therto-deluded world owes a=20

correct knowledge of the real nature of the Kosmos, of the true origin of t=
he universe and man, as=20

revealed in the automatic and mechanical theories of the Physicists, in acc=
ordance with strictly=20

scientific Philosophy? Before our cultured era, Science was but a name, Phi=
losophy a delusion=20

and a snare. According to the modest claims of contemporary authority on ge=
nuine Science and=20

Philosophy, the Tree of Knowledge has only now sprung from the dead weeds o=
f superstition, as a=20

beautiful butterfly emerges from an ugly grub. We have, therefore, nothing =
for which to thank our=20

forefathers. The Ancients have at best prepared and fertilised the soil; it=
 is the Moderns who have=20

planted the seeds of knowledge and reared the lovely plants called blank ne=
gation and sterile=20

agnosticism.  Such, however, is not the view taken by Theosophists. They re=
peat what was stated=20

twenty years ago. It is not sufficient to speak of the "untenable conceptio=
ns of an uncultured past"=20

(Tyndall); of the "_parler enfantin_" of the Vaidic poets (Max Mueller); of=
 the "absurdities" of the=20

Neoplatonists (Jowett); and of the ignorance of the Chaldaeo-Assyrian initi=
ated Priests with regard=20

to their own symbols, when compared with the knowledge thereon of the Briti=
sh Orientalist=20

(Sayce). Such assumptions have to be proven by something more solid than th=
e mere word of=20

these scholars. For no amount of boastful arrogance can hide the intellectu=
al quarries out of which=20

the representations of so many modern Philosophers and Scholars have been c=
arved. How many=20

of the most distinguished European Scientists have derived honour and credi=
t for the mere=20

dressing-up of the ideas of these old Philosophers, whom they are ever read=
y to disparage, is left=20

to an impartial posterity to say. Thus it does seem not altogether untrue a=
s stated in _Isis=20

Unveiled_, to say of certain Orientalists and Scholars of dead languages, t=
hat they will allow their=20

boundless conceit and self-opinionatedness to run away with their logic and=
 reasoning powers,=20

rather than concede to the ancient Philosophers the knowledge of anything t=
he modern do not=20

know.  As part of this work treats of the Initiates and the secret knowledg=
e imparted during the=20

Mysteries, the statements of those who, in spite of the fact that Plato was=
 an Initiate, maintain that=20

no hidden Mysticism is to be discovered in his works, have to be first exam=
ined. Too many of the=20

present scholars, Greek and Sanskrit, are but too apt to forego facts in fa=
vour of their own=20

preconceived theories based on personal prejudice. They conveniently forget=
, at every=20

opportunity, not only the numerous changes in language, but also that the a=
llegorical style in the=20

writings of old Philosophers and the secretiveness of the Mystics had their=
 _raison d'etre_; that=20

both the pre-Christian and the post-Christian congested. Also man found dea=
d with handkerchief=20

tied around neck and twisted by razor strop. Taylor considered both as suic=
ides. Also a third case=20

(Amer. edit., 1880, p. 465). A man of unsound mind twisted a fishing-net fi=
rmly around his neck=20

several times; it remained secure without the aid of a knot.  37. _Fargues:=

mislead their translators and profane critics. But these critics will admit=
 nothing of the kind, as will=20

presently be seen.  For over twenty-two centuries everyone who has read Pla=
to has been aware=20

that, like most of the other Greek Philosophers of note, he had holding the=
