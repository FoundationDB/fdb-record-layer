Oscar, opening his honest eyes; "how can we help it?"  "I suppose we _can't=
_ help it," said=20

Edmund.  "But we might telegraph," said Oscar; "it's a heap easier than wri=

And they vanished out of the October sunshine into the beam-shot gloom of V=

But Oscar shook his head. "No, Ned, that ain't fair. I'm the most to blame =
and I ought to do it.=20

Besides _you_ wouldn't say it was my fault."  Then the last barrier of Edmu=
nd's pride broke down.=20

"Don't," he cried again. "I tell you it's I'm to blame, not you. And-- and-=
-Oscar, I've been very mean=20

to you all along"--  "No, you haven't," said Oscar promptly; "it was me bul=

not speak. There were moments with him when he could not speak lest his sou=

of his mouth and flit irrecoverably away. And he could not find the tomb. S=
ave for the outrageous=20

tomb of mighty Newton, the nave seemed to be as naked as when it came into =
the world. Yet he=20

was sure he was buried in the nave--and only three years ago, too! Astoundi=
ng, was it not, what=20

could happen in three years? He knew that the tomb had not been removed, fo=

whether the Dean and Chapter did not=20

It's lonesome travelling around with a feller that's mad with you all the t=

little lump in his throat. "If you'll make up with me, now, I'll never be m=
ad with you again," said he,=20

holding out his hand.  Oscar clasped it across the bed over the mangled rem=
ains of the too-

adventurous Marcus Aurelius, whose adventures, thus, were not quite in vain=
.  Edmund kept his=20

word. Indeed, he was surprised to find how easy it was to like Oscar; and N=
ora's prediction was=20

fulfilled. The two boys were very happy in Europe; but Edmund never forgot =
Marcus. He told the=20

truth to Nora and she persuaded Mrs. Morris to deal gently with Oscar. He w=
ent to the races, after=20

all. Previously Edmund had written the whole story to Lady Margaret in a le=
tter which she read=20

with smiles and tears. The postscript was by Oscar. It ran as follows:     =
DEER LADY=20

MARGARET:--    Ned wont let me see his letter but I'm sure he   took all th=
e blame on himself=20

becaws he always dose   but it was me too blame and not him becaws I   pine=

remains to say that Marcus=20

Aurelius is back home, at Lady Margaret's; but she never makes a bracelet o=
f him, for the=20

correction of a fundamental error in the burial department. He was gloomy; =
he had in truth been=20

somewhat gloomy ever since the trial. Perhaps it was the shadow of the wrat=
h of the Dean and=20

Chapter on him. He had ceased to procure joy in the daily manifestations of=
 life in the streets of=20

the town. And this failure to discover the tomb intensified the calm, amiab=
le sadness which=20

distinguished him.  Alice, gazing around, chiefly with her mouth, inquired =
suddenly--  "What's that=20

printing there?"  She had detected a legend incised on one of the small sto=
ne flags which form the=20

vast floor of the nave. They stooped over it. "PRIAM FARLL," it said simply=
, in fine Roman letters=20

and then his dates. That was all. Near by, on other flags, they deciphered =
other names of honour.=20

This austere method of marking the repose of the dead commended itself to h=
im, caused him to=20

feel proud of himself and of the ridiculous England that somehow keeps our =
great love. His gloom=20

faded. And do you know what idea rushed from his heart to his brain? "By Jo=
ve! I will paint finer=20

pictures than any I've done yet!" And the impulse to recommence the work of=
 creation surged over=20

him. The tears started to his eyes.  "I like that!" murmured Alice, gazing =
at the stone. "I do think=20

that's nice."  And _he_ said, because he truly felt it, because the will to=
 live raged through him=20

again, tingling and smarting:  "I'm glad I'm not there."  They smiled at ea=
ch other, and their=20

instinctive hands fumblingly met.  A few days later, the=20


_
ingeniously mended and stuffed, he abides perpetually in a glass case; and =
she describes his=20

perfections and his lamentable end with tears in her eyes.    ANNA AND THE =
RATTLER  By Mrs.=20

Cornell  A voice rose wrathfully in the back yard, "Wee-lie! What iss this?=
 You fell in the pig=20

trough? Come here, that I beat you! Come here, I say!"  Willie did not acce=
pt the invitation. A shrill=20

whimpering was his sole response. Twelve-year-old Anna stepped to the kitch=
en door, peering=20

round the sash. "Pa's scolding Willie," she announced to her mother.  The s=
torm continued to rage=20

in the back yard.  "Shust look at your clothes! Go now! To the creek wit' y=
ou! Come _not_ in the=20

house until you are cleaned. Ach!"  Ex-Sea-Captain Schulz, now prune-grower=
 in the mountain=20

boundary west of Santa Clara Valley, turned in at the kitchen door.  "I don=
't know what to do wit'=20

the boy. Go, mine Anna, get the lad a clean shirt, and take it down to the =
creek."  On Anna's return=20

from the bathing pool she said softly to her mother, "Willie isn't at the c=
reek. Perhaps he has run=20

off."  "O child, don't bother me about majestic rebuke of the _Daily Record=
_, amended the floor of=20

Valhalla and caused the mortal residuum of the immortal organism known as H=
enry Leek to be=20

nocturnally transported to a different bed.   _On Board_   A few days later=
, also, a North German=20

Lloyd steamer quitted Southampton for Algiers, bearing among its passengers=
 Priam and Alice. It=20

was a rough starlit night, and from the stern of the vessel the tumbled whi=
te water made a pathway=20

straight to receding England. Priam had come to love the slopes of Putney w=
ith the broad river at=20

the foot; but he showed what I think was a nice feeling in leaving England.=
 His sojourn in our land=20

had not crowned him with brilliance. He was not a being created for society=
, nor for cutting a=20

figure, nor for exhibiting tact and prudence in the crises of existence. He=
 could neither talk well nor=20

read well, nor express himself in exactly suitable actions. He could only e=
xpress himself at the end=20

of a brush. He could only paint extremely beautiful pictures. That was the =
major part of his vitality.=20

In minor ways he may have been, upon occasions, a fool. But=20


_
enough, he's that scared of the mountains and the trees."  Anna was conscio=
us of an undercurrent=20

of sympathy with the forlorn waif her father had brought from the city some=
 months before. The=20

very love and awe with which the mountains filled her imaginative soul gave=
 her comprehension of=20

the fear with which they imbued the dull-witted offspring of San Francisco =
gutters.  Willie did not=20

return all a fool on canvas. He said everything there, and said it to perfe=
ction, for those who could=20

read, for those who can read, and for those who will be able to read five h=
undred years hence.=20

Why expect more from him? Why be disappointed in him? One does not expect a=
 wire-walker to=20

play fine billiards. You yourself, mirror of prudence that you are, would h=
ave certainly avoided all=20

Priam's manifold=20


_
his American wife spread and dipped prunes busily on the hot south slope. T=
he box-laden wagon=20

rolled by at intervals. Household duties went helter-skelter under Anna's m=
anagement. At six=20

o'clock Mrs. Schulz, hot and tired, wakened her lazy little daughter, outst=
retched beneath the=20

hollyhocks and poppies in the small front garden.  "For gracious sake, Anna=
! Hurry! You've not=20

done the dinner dishes!"  "Have the cows come?" Anna asked, resourcefully. =
 "Land! If I hadn't=20

forgotten about Willie! Come--hurry! You'll have to go for the cows. I'll w=
ash the dishes."  Anna felt=20

quite in the mood to go for the cows. It meant an hour or so of patting bar=
efooted and bare headed=20

along the soft dust of the road, or over the slippery brown grass of the mo=
untain pastures, with tall=20

pines on every hand and a gold-blue sky above.  She mused about the missing=
 Willie. Had he=20

carried out his occasional threat to run away?  "The road is open, go when =
you like," was her=20

father's one reply to such futile outbursts. But they well knew the road wa=
s not open to Willie. The=20

six mountain miles intervening between their ranch and the station formed a=
n impassable barrier=20

to his timorous soul.  "I guess he's afraid of the bigness of things," Anna=
 concluded. "And he's got=20

no social career; but, you see, he was divine in another way.  As the steam=
er sped along the=20

lengthening pathway from England, one question kept hopping in and out of h=
is mind:  "_I wonder=20

what they'll do with me next time_?"  Do not imagine that he and Alice were=
 staring over the stern=20

at the singular isle. No! There were imperative reasons, which affected bot=
h of them, against that.=20

It was only in the moments of the comparative calm which always follows ins=
urrections, that Priam=20

had leisure to wonder, and to see his own limitations, and joyfully to medi=
tate upon the prospect of=20

age devoted to the sole doing of that which he could so supremely, in a swe=

ves of a hill trail, she=20

sprang aside in quick dismay.  "Goodness!" What had seemed to be a bunch of=

grass coiled swiftly, with the rattling whir that goes straight to the fear=
