=E2=80=9CLook!=E2=80=9D Ivan suddenly exclaimed, pointing to the scene befo=
re them. While absorbed in their eager=20

talk, they had been ascending an eminence, from the top of which they now c=
aught their first sight=20

of the magnificent capital of France. The sun had just set, but its parting=
 beams still lingered upon=20

the gilded dome of the H=C3=B4tel des Invalides and the stately summit of t=
he Pantheon. =E2=80=9CParis! Paris!=E2=80=9D=20

was the exclamation that broke from every lip, and resounded far and wide i=
n lengthened cries of=20

fierce joy and exultation. =E2=80=9CParis! Paris!=E2=80=9D was shouted agai=
n and yet again, as rank after rank of that=20

gallant army beheld the goal of all their aspirations, the end of all their=
 toils.  After the first=20

involuntary cry Ivan was silent. At length he said quietly to his friend To=
lstoi, =E2=80=9CWhen I think of that=20

terrible September, the last but one, and of the flames of Moscow, the wond=
er and the gladness=20

seem too great, too awful for words.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThose flames are bu=
rning in many a heart now,=E2=80=9D Tolstoi=20

answered.--=E2=80=9CI suppose they will hardly let us in yonder without a s=
truggle,=E2=80=9D he added in an altered=20

tone. =E2=80=9CWhat will to-morrow bring?=E2=80=9D     CHAPTER XXV.  =E2=80=
=9CFATHER PARIS FOR MOTHER=20

MOSCOW.=E2=80=9D    =E2=80=9CLay the sword on his breast; there=E2=80=99s n=
o spot on its blade   In whose cankering=20

breath his bright laurels will fade:   It was taken up first at humanity=E2=
=80=99s call;   It was sheathed with=20

sweet mercy when glory was all.=E2=80=9D   The passion and the tumult, the =
glory and the agony of the next=20

day will live in History as long as History herself lives to depict the sce=
nes of blood and violence=20

which earth has witnessed. No battle in that terrible war was more hotly or=
 more obstinately=20

contested than the battle of Paris; although it ought to be remembered that=
 it was not the men of=20

Paris who contested every inch of ground with the Allies, but the corps of =
Marmont and Mortier,=20

old soldiers of Napoleon, the National Guard, and the youths of the Ecole P=
olytechnique.  The sun=20

that shone upon that long day=E2=80=99s conflict was already near its setti=
ng when Ivan, with the rest of the=20



Chevalier Guard, was still straining every nerve to drive the French from t=
he Butte de Chaumont,=20

an important height commanding the city. It is not enough to say that he fo=
ught with gallantry: all=20

did that. He fought as one whose whole soul was in the work--who was consci=
ous of no thought,=20

no impulse, no resolve save that Paris must be won for the Czar that day. H=
is horse was at a=20

gallop; his red sabre was driving the fleeing French before him; the crest =
of the hill was reached;=20

the city lay outspread beneath his feet;--when a well-aimed bullet grazed t=
he top of his silver=20

cuirass, and passed through his right shoulder. Faint and dizzy, he still p=
ressed on. To be stopped=20

_now_ would be intolerable. But in another moment his senses reeled; all th=
ings grew dim about=20

him. He had barely time to thrust the colours which he held into the hand o=
f the comrade nearest=20

him; then, after clutching vainly at the mane of his horse, he found himsel=
f lying under its hoofs.=20

Immeasurably bitter was the thrill of disappointment that flashed through h=
im ere consciousness=20

departed. =E2=80=9CI shall _not_ enter Paris with my Czar,=E2=80=9D he murm=
ured with his failing voice. After that he=20

knew nothing.  When he came to himself he was still lying on the ground whe=
re he had fallen.=20

Blood was flowing freely from the wound in his shoulder, but no hoof of hor=
se had grazed him as=20

he lay--all had passed him by, sparing the fallen, as those noble and gentl=
e creatures so often do.=20

He heard voices near him, and to his joy they spoke in _Russian_. Then the =
Butte de Chaumont=20

was theirs yet! He raised himself with an effort, and looked about him. It =
was night, but lights were=20

blazing all around. A party of artillery occupied the height which he and h=
is comrades had won for=20

them, and the gunners were standing, match in hand, beside their loaded pie=
ces. It was evident=20

that the word of command to fire upon the city that lay outspread beneath t=
hem was expected=20

every instant. Fierce and eager was the excitement. The passionate, exultin=
g anticipation which=20

kindled every eye and throbbed in every heart resounded on all sides in =E2=
=80=9Chouras=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cvivas,=E2=80=9D=20

while from lip to lip along the ranks the cry was echoed and re-echoed, =E2=
=80=9CFather Paris, you shall=20

pay for Mother Moscow!=E2=80=9D  A voice near Ivan--a voice that Ivan knew-=
-exclaimed, in tones of=20

deepest emotion, =E2=80=9CThank God and the saints, we have our revenge thi=
s night for our beautiful and=20

holy city, laid in ashes--ay, and for our dead, our _murdered_! Anna Popovn=
a, in _thy_ name I=20

send the messenger of Death into the homes of the infidel Nyemtzi.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CMichael! Michael=20

Ivanovitch!=E2=80=9D Ivan called in a faint and quivering voice.  Fortunate=
ly Michael heard the sound, and=20

moved towards the spot whence it came. =E2=80=9CGreat St. Nicholas!=E2=80=
=9D exclaimed he, =E2=80=9Cit is Barrinka!=E2=80=9D  A=20

good soldier always knows what to do for a wounded comrade. Water, mixed wi=
th a little brandy,=20

was quickly borne to the lips of Ivan; and gladly would Michael have bound =
the wound himself,=20

only he thought it right to yield the privilege to some one who had the use=
 of both his hands. =E2=80=9CBut=20

what shall we do for linen?=E2=80=9D asked the gunner who undertook the sur=
geon=E2=80=99s office.  =E2=80=9CHere is the=20

very thing we want!=E2=80=9D cried Michael, delightedly producing from his =
knapsack a clean white cambric=20

handkerchief.  =E2=80=9CA token from some fair one, I suppose,=E2=80=9D sai=
d his comrade with a laugh, as he took=20

it from his hand.  =E2=80=9CA token from some one harder to find,=E2=80=9D =
returned Michael. =E2=80=9CFrom a Frenchman=20

with a notion of justice and mercy in his head.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe Fren=
chmen shall learn what justice is before=20

the dawn of to-morrow=E2=80=99s sun,=E2=80=9D said the gunner with a dark a=
nd angry look.  He bound Ivan=E2=80=99s wound=20

as well as he could, gave him a little more brandy and water, and then, wit=
h Michael=E2=80=99s assistance,=20

placed him on a kind of couch made of cloaks and blankets. Meanwhile their =
companions kindled=20

a fire, the warmth of which proved welcome to all the party.  =E2=80=9CI fe=
el quite comfortable now,=E2=80=9D said=20

Ivan. =E2=80=9CThank you, my brothers.=E2=80=9D  At that moment an exclamat=
ion of amazement broke from the=20



entire group. Upon a pole, on an eminence near them, a white flag was visib=
le through the=20

darkness. Bitter murmurs, even cries of disappointment, began to be heard. =
=E2=80=9CCan it be,=E2=80=9D cried=20

Michael, =E2=80=9Cthat they are dreaming of a truce now--now--with the city=
 in our very hands? It must be=20

those accursed treacherous Austrians or those fools of Prussians who are sh=
owing the white=20

feather. But the Czar will never listen to them--_never_!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CNever!=E2=80=9D eagerly assented all around.=20

=E2=80=9CHe remembers the flames of Moscow.=E2=80=9D  They were not left lo=
ng in suspense. Presently an aide-

de-camp, galloping along the lines, brought the orders of the Czar: =E2=80=
=9CExtinguish your matches. Pile=20

your muskets. The city is about to capitulate.=E2=80=9D  The order was obey=
ed, but with a great and bitter=20

cry, like the cry of a wild beast that sees his prey escape him. Rage and d=
isappointment filled=20

every heart to overflowing. Michael flung himself on his knees beside his n=
ow useless gun,=20

covering his face with his one hand, while the tears rolled down his weathe=
r-beaten cheeks.=20

Touched by his distress, Ivan called him to his side. =E2=80=9CWhat is the =
matter, friend?=E2=80=9D he asked gently.=20

=E2=80=9CMatter, Barrinka? Matter enough to break the heart of a man who ha=
s marched from Moscow to=20

Paris with only one thought, one hope in his heart--the hope of vengeance.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI cannot blame you,=20

Michael. You have bitter wrongs to avenge.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAy, Barrinka,=
=E2=80=9D answered he, choking down the=20

emotion he did not wish to betray. =E2=80=9CI see nothing day and night but=
 that sweet pale face with the=20

look of death upon it. Only killing Nyemtzi makes it go away now and then f=
or a little while. All this=20

time I have been thinking, perhaps if we kill Nyemtzi enough--kill and dest=
roy them utterly--

_utterly_,=E2=80=9D he repeated, sending out the word with a hissing sound =
through his clenched teeth,=20

=E2=80=9Cthat face may go or change--change back again,=E2=80=9D he added m=
ore gently, =E2=80=9Cto the old happy look it=20

used to have in the bygone days when she was my betrothed, before the Nyemt=
zi came and=20

ruined everything.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI think, Michael, there may be anothe=
r way to bring the change you long for,=E2=80=9D=20

began Ivan; but Michael interrupted him.  =E2=80=9CNo!=E2=80=9D he cried pa=
ssionately--=E2=80=9Cno way but killing Nyemtzi.=20

=E2=80=9CWhat do you suppose has made the Czar forbid it? Ever since we ent=
ered this land of the enemy,=20

he has held back his avenging armies, as one might hold a bloodhound in the=
 leash from springing=20

on his prey. Is it that _he_ has no wrongs to revenge; that _he_ has forgot=
ten holy Moscow and=20

that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the w=

complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in al=

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator=
 of the Project=20

Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely =
shared with anyone.  For=20

thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with =
only a loose network=20

of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from s=
everal printed=20

editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a =
copyright notice is=20

included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any p=
articular paper=20

edition.  Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's=
 eBook number, often=20

in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML=
 and others.=20

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old=
 filename and etext=20

number.  The replaced older file is renamed. VERSIONS based on separate sou=
rces are treated=20

as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.  Most people start=

the cloak, =E2=80=9CIf I had my other hand, I would do it better for you, B=
arrinka.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou have done it well,=20

my friend; but you must often miss your hand, and regret its loss.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CRegret it!=E2=80=9D cried Michael with=20

the old enthusiasm flashing from his eyes. =E2=80=9C_Never!_ Did I not give=
 it for the Czar?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMichael,=20

listen to me. As you love and honour the Czar, so the Czar loves and honour=
s _his King_.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9C_His_=20

king?=E2=80=9D repeated Michael, wondering. But a moment afterwards he made=
 the sign of the cross. =E2=80=9CI=20

understand,=E2=80=9D he said in a lower voice.  Ivan resumed: =E2=80=9CThe =
thought of vengeance may have been=20

dear to him--dear as was your hand to you--still at the command of his King=
, and for his sake, it=20

was surrendered, and that joyfully. You see?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI see.=E2=
=80=9D Michael relapsed into silence, and stood=20

gazing thoughtfully upon the city spread out beneath their feet, and growin=
g every moment clearer=20

in the dawning light. At last he said, turning once again to Ivan, =E2=80=
=9CBarrinka, it is true I gave my hand=20

for the Czar. But I never thought he would care--or even hear of it. He did=
 though; he spoke to me=20

with his own lips. He thanked me, and said I had been found faithful. Not _=
one_ hand, but two,=20

would have been well lost for that. But will his King speak to the Czar and=
 thank him?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D Ivan=20

answered, =E2=80=9Che will, thought I cannot tell how. God has many ways of=
 speaking to his servants.=E2=80=9D  In=20

due time the day broke, and the sun arose over Paris. Then came relief and =
refreshment for the=20

troops, and surgical help and care for the wounded. Then came also the tidi=
ngs, flashing from rank=20

to rank, =E2=80=9CThe capitulation is signed. The city has surrendered _wit=
hout conditions_. At half-past=20

three o=E2=80=99clock this morning, the keys of Paris were placed in the ha=
nds of Alexander.=E2=80=9D     CHAPTER=20

XXVI.  AT VERSAILLES.    =E2=80=9CA poor man helped by thee shall make thee=
 rich;   A sick man served=20

by thee shall make thee whole:   Thou shalt be blessed thyself in every sen=
se   Of blessing which=20

thou renderest.=E2=80=9D   The two years so eventful to others had not pass=
ed without change over the=20

mother and sister Henri de Talmont left sorrowing behind him in the cottage=
 at Brie. That he had=20

joined the corps of recruits instead of making his escape soon became known=
 to them. Both were=20

stricken to the heart; and because this was so, the grief of both was still=
 and silent. Cl=C3=A9mence told=20

her mother Henri=E2=80=99s parting words, upon which a mournful light was t=
hrown by what followed. But=20

these brought little comfort, and no tidings since had reached them from th=
e wanderer. As may=20

have been inferred, the letter intrusted to Seppel was never posted; and He=
nri did not write again.=20

At length came news of the appalling disasters in Russia. Neither Madame de=
 Talmont nor=20

Cl=C3=A9mence indulged the faintest hope that Henri could have survived the=
m. They mourned for the=20

one who =E2=80=9Cwas not,=E2=80=9D in an utter desolation, beyond words and=
 beyond tears.  Sometimes they=20

murmured sadly to each other, =E2=80=9CIf only we knew the truth.=E2=80=9D =
For it was one of the bitterest drops in=20

their full cup of bitterness that they could not tell in what form death ha=
d come to their beloved,=20

while they knew but too well how hideous and revolting were some of the for=
ms assumed by the=20

king of terrors. Horrible details reached them, piercing the thick veil of =
falsehood with which=20

Napoleon sought to hide the disasters of his army; and imagination--that ma=
gician so powerful for=20

good and evil--exercised a fearful ingenuity in torturing their aching hear=
ts to the uttermost.  These=20



were pangs they endured in common; but each had besides her solitary burden=
 of pain. That of=20

the mother was tinged with something like the bitterness of remorse. She ha=
d been wroth with her=20

boy for deceiving her and betraying the cause she held dearer than life. Pr=
ide and anger had kept=20

her back from obeying the first impulse of her heart when she heard of him =
as amongst the=20

conscripts who left the village. She thought of hastening after him to Pari=
s, that he might not go=20

forth to die without his mother=E2=80=99s pardon and her blessing. But she =
put the thought aside. The=20

difficulties in her way would have been very great, yet it was not these th=
at deterred her. It was the=20

persuasion that he did not deserve this sacrifice at her hands--that the fi=
rst step towards a=20

reconciliation ought to come from him. If he wished for it, why had he not =
written?--But now=20

irrevocable past.=E2=80=9D  Cl=C3=A9mence too had her lonely sorrow. Deeply=
 thoughtful and truly pious, after the=20

strong, stern, self-sacrificing Jansenist fashion, she knew too well that h=
er brother=E2=80=99s young heart=20

had never truly surrendered itself to its Creator and Redeemer. The =E2=80=
=9CExcept ye be converted=E2=80=9D of=20

the Divine Teacher held as real a place in the creed of Cl=C3=A9mence as in=
 that of any Protestant; nor,=20

under the circumstances, could the Catholic belief in sacramentary grace in=
terpose its soft,=20

misleading glamour between her eyes and the truth. So her soul went down to=
 the depths of a=20

sorrow without hope; depths that few are strong enough to sound, and those =
who do sound them=20

seldom tell what they find there. Some, it may be, bring back from thence s=
ecrets of divine love,=20

=E2=80=9Ctreasures of the deep that lieth under,=E2=80=9D worth all they ha=
ve passed through to learn them. But it=20

was not so with Cl=C3=A9mence. She brought no pearls with her from the deep=
s of ocean. It was much if=20

she herself came back, or rather _drifted_ back, forlorn and weary, because=
 mind and body were=20

no longer strong enough to bear the strain of intense emotion. She said in =
her heart,--as poor=20

Henri thought she would do all too easily,--=E2=80=9CIt is the will of God;=
=E2=80=9D but she never truly said, =E2=80=9CThy will=20

be done.=E2=80=9D Perhaps she made her heavy burden heavier by asking from =
herself what God never=20

asked from her; forgetting that it is _not_ his will that any sinner should=
 perish, and that Christ=20

himself wept tears of divine compassion over lost souls. So her own faith g=
rew dim and clouded,=20

until even the sense of personal love to God seemed to vanish away, and wit=
h it the trust in his=20



love to her; for, unhappily, her creed did _not_ teach her that his love to=
 his chosen and adopted is=20

=E2=80=9Ceverlasting.=E2=80=9D  In the course of time an outward change was=
 mercifully sent to break up the current=20

of those two sorrowful lives. A widowed sister of Madame de Talmont=E2=80=
=99s mother had been able to=20

retain a portion of her property through all the storms of the Revolution. =
Madame de Salgues had=20

lost both her sons, and only one grandson remained to her, the object of he=
r passionate devotion.=20

But the agents of Napoleon kept watch over the lad, as a scion of the old n=
oblesse; and when he=20

had attained a suitable age, Madame de Salgues was requested to send him to=
 the Ecole=20

Polytechnique, such a request being too evidently a command. She wept, but =
had to obey;=20

removing, however, to Paris, in order to be near him. But the superintenden=
t of police, the=20

notorious Savary, had a word to say upon that subject; and the poor old lad=
y was soon forbidden=20

to reside within the city. Remonstrance was useless; so she retired to Vers=
ailles, where she was=20

still near enough to receive frequent visits from her grandson. Finding her=
self alone and lonely,=20

with failing health and depressed spirits, she thought of Madame de Talmont=
; and very wisely=20

wrote offering a comfortable home to her and her daughter, if they would co=
me and cheer her=20

declining years.  The invitation was accepted with thankfulness; and the fi=
rst faint gleams of=20

comfort stole unconsciously into the darkened hearts of Madame de Talmont a=
nd Cl=C3=A9mence as=20

they sought to soothe the sorrows of another. Poor Madame de Salgues had so=
on a fresh grief to=20

mourn over. Like all her family, she was a stanch Legitimist, and she had b=
rought up her grandson=20

in the same political creed; but he could not long withstand the influence =
of his new surroundings.=20

Before he had been three months at the Ecole Polytechnique, his teachers an=
d fellow-pupils had=20

wrought a rapid conversion, and made him as fiery and unreasoning a partisa=
n of Napoleon as he=20

had once been of the Bourbons. Emile de Salgues was not a lad whose opinion=
s upon any subject=20

were likely to be of particular importance to the rest of the world, but to=
 Madame de Salgues the=20

apostasy of her grandson from the good cause was a very grievous affliction=
.  The invasion of=20

France by the Allies, and the attack upon Paris, caused many apprehensions =
to the household of=20

unprotected ladies; but, as they themselves would have expressed it, they w=
ere =E2=80=9Cquitte pour la=20

peur,=E2=80=9D no adversary nor evil of any kind came near them. They all r=
ejoiced at the overthrow of=20

Napoleon, but with trembling, and that for more reasons than one,--they cou=
ld not yet believe it=20

was real, and they had not the slightest idea of what was to take his place=
.  On the day following=20

the entry of the conquerors into Paris, Madame de Talmont said to her daugh=
ter, =E2=80=9CCl=C3=A9mence, the=20

Allies have sent their wounded here.=E2=80=9D  Cl=C3=A9mence looked up from=
 the embroidery upon which she=20

was engaged. Two years of sorrow had changed the young girl into a grave an=
d quiet woman; but=20

there was even a rarer beauty than of old in her pale and sculptured face. =
=E2=80=9CThere must be many=20

wounded,=E2=80=9D she remarked with an air of sadness. =E2=80=9CEvery one s=
ays the fight was an obstinate one.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CThe hospital is full to overflowing. Cl=C3=A9mence, they are all o=
f them mothers=E2=80=99 sons, _also_.=E2=80=9D  In the=20

last word there was an undertone of pain that went straight to the heart of=
 Cl=C3=A9mence. =E2=80=9CTrue, dear=20

mother,=E2=80=9D she said softly.  =E2=80=9CI have been thinking,=E2=80=9D =
Madame de Talmont resumed, =E2=80=9Cthat it would do=20

us good to try and comfort some of them, even a little. What should _we_ fe=
el now, if we knew that=20

any one had done it for our beloved?=E2=80=9D  With Cl=C3=A9mence a call to=
 action always found a ready=20

response. =E2=80=9CWhat can we do, mother?=E2=80=9D she asked with even a t=
ouch of eagerness.  =E2=80=9CTo some of the=20

sick men fruit may be welcome; to others, a little money to buy the triflin=
g luxuries they may long=20

for; to all, kind words will not be valueless.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut, moth=
er, they are Germans and Russians. They=20



will not understand us.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CSome of them will. At all events=
, we can try.=E2=80=9D  An hour afterwards, two=20

ladies dressed in deep mourning and closely veiled entered the Hospital of =
Versailles. Each=20

carried a basket filled with grapes and oranges, which they easily obtained=
 permission to distribute=20

amongst the patients.  =E2=80=9CThese are all Russians who are here,=E2=80=
=9D they were told; =E2=80=9Cthe Prussians and=20

Austrians have been provided for in other places.=E2=80=9D  The sufferers w=
ere well cared for, as well at=20

least as circumstances permitted. A liberal allowance was made for their su=
pport by their own=20

government; and the Mayor of Versailles interested himself so warmly in the=
ir welfare, that the=20

Czar afterwards wrote him an autograph letter of thanks.  Madame de Talmont=
 and Cl=C3=A9mence=20

passed between long rows of pallets, distributing their little gifts, which=
 were most thankfully=20

received, especially the oranges, of which the Russians were excessively fo=
nd. They tried to show=20

their gratitude by looks and signs; and one poor fellow, remembering a word=
 which is the same in=20

most languages and full of blessing in all, brought tears to the sad eyes o=
f Cl=C3=A9mence by looking up=20

and murmuring, =E2=80=9CChristohs;=E2=80=9D as though he would have said, =
=E2=80=9CWe are one in Him.=E2=80=9D  They came at=20

last to the ward where the wounded officers lay. Their little store was lon=
g since exhausted; and=20

even had it been otherwise, they would have thought the common soldiers gre=
ater objects of=20

compassion. So they passed on rather quickly, and without paying much heed =
to the pale but=20

interested faces which were raised from many a pillow to gaze at the gentle=
, sweet-looking ladies,=20

the very sight of whom seemed to do the poor sufferers good.  At length one=
 face arrested the eye=20

of Madame de Talmont, and she could not but pause for another look. It was =
a young and=20

handsome face, with a burning spot on either cheek, and a contraction of th=
e brows that told the=20

story of feverish pain. Yet, in spite of weariness and suffering, the eyes =
were absolutely beaming=20

with joy, and a happy, satisfied smile played over the parted lips.  She st=
ood for a moment by the=20

side of the invalid. =E2=80=9CMy young friend,=E2=80=9D she said kindly, =
=E2=80=9Cyou seem to be in pain; and yet you look=20

happy.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, madame, I am indeed happy,=E2=80=9D answered=
 Ivan Pojarsky, who had just been=20

receiving a visit from his friend Tolstoi. =E2=80=9CHow can I help it? Yest=
erday the Czar entered Paris in=20

triumph.=E2=80=9D  He spoke French as correctly and with almost as pure an =
accent as Madame de=20

Talmont herself. She was touched and interested by his words. =E2=80=9CBut,=
=E2=80=9D she asked, =E2=80=9Cdo you not feel=20

it hard to be lying here, helpless and suffering, while your Emperor and yo=
ur companions in arms=20

enjoy their triumph?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COh no, madame,=E2=80=9D he said wit=
h animation; =E2=80=9CI cannot think of that. Nor could=20

you, if you belonged to my Czar. If you had seen the flames of Moscow; had =
heard the thunder=20

when the mines exploded that laid half our Kremlin in ruins; had witnessed =
the faith and courage=20

that upheld him _then_, had watched the long and weary conflict he has wage=
d from that hour=20

until now--patient, wise, self-sacrificing, undaunted[50],--you would rejoi=
ce for him in the very=20

depths of your heart that the goal is won at last, that he stands a conquer=
or in the midst of Paris,=20

and possesses the gate of his enemies!=E2=80=9D In his eagerness he half ra=
ised himself, his eyes=20

sparkled, and his whole face flushed with excitement.  =E2=80=9CGently, gen=
tly, my poor young friend,=E2=80=9D said=20

Madame de Talmont in a tone of almost motherly tenderness. =E2=80=9CI fear =
you will hurt yourself.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COh=20

no, madame;=E2=80=9D--but even as he spoke his colour changed rapidly, and =
his lip quivered with the pain=20

he tried to hide.  Meanwhile, many thoughts were passing through the mind o=
f the silent but=20

observant Cl=C3=A9mence. There was a little stand beside the bed, upon whic=
h were a phial containing=20

medicine, a small book, and a clean white cambric handkerchief. She saw, wi=
th interest and=20

pleasure, that the book was a copy of the New Testament in French. Then her=
 eye rested upon=20



the folded cambric, and presently a cry of amazement broke from her lips.  =
Every one started and=20

looked towards her. Madame de Talmont was terror-stricken. So quiet and sel=
f-contained had=20

Cl=C3=A9mence ever been, that even in childhood a cry from her lips was a t=
hing almost unknown. And=20

now, with a face as white as that of any of the stricken sufferers around t=
hem, she was placing the=20

handkerchief in the hand of her mother.=20

=E2=80=9CWill you kindly place=20

the mother was as great as that of=20

the daughter. Both were gazing spell-bound at the crest, worked curiously a=
nd skilfully on a corner=20

of the handkerchief, and having beneath it the initials =E2=80=9CH. de T.=
=E2=80=9D No wonder; for it was the fingers of=20

Cl=C3=A9mence that had wrought every stitch, and her mother=E2=80=99s eyes =
had watched the work. In both=20

hearts a horrible dread succeeded to the first rush of uncontrollable and u=

Was this amongst the spoils of the dead?  Ivan watched them with pitying ey=
es. =E2=80=9CHave the=20

=E2=80=9C_Is_,=E2=80=9D Ivan corrected.  From that moment to her dying day =
