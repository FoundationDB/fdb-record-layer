miners are working in the mines, and the harvest reaped by them is not at all discouraging. All 

along the gulch are strung a profusion of cabins, tents and shanties, making Deadwood in reality a 

town of a dozen miles in length, though some enterprising individual has paired off a couple more 

infant cities above Deadwood proper, named respectively Elizabeth City and Ten Strike. The 

quartz formation in these neighborhoods is something extraordinary, and from late in your 

quotation from Lord Lytton's play of "Richelieu," "The pen is mightier than the sword."  Lord Lytton 

would never have put his signature to so naked a sentiment.  Surely I will not.  In the text there 

was a prefix or qualification:    Beneath the rule of men entirely great   The pen is mightier than the 

sword.  Now, this world does not often present the condition of facts herein described.  Men 

entirely great are very rare indeed, and even Washington, 


_
under vigorous and earnest development are yielding beyond the most sanguine expectation.  The 

placer mines west of Camp Crook are being opened to very satisfactory results, and, in fact, from 

Custer City in the south, to Deadwood in the north, all is the scene of abundant enthusiasm and 

excitement.  A horseman riding north through Custer gulch, noticed the placard so prominently 

posted for public inspection, and with a low whistle, expressive of astonishment, wheeled his 

horse out of the stage road, and rode over to the foot of the tree in question, and ran his eyes over 

the few irregularly-written lines traced upon the notice.  He was a youth of an age somewhere 

between sixteen and twenty, trim and compactly built, with a preponderance of muscular 

development and animal spirits; broad and deep of chest, with square, iron-cast shoulders; limbs 

small yet like bars of steel, and with a use for the sword and the pen, each in its proper sphere. 

You and I have seen the day when a great and good man ruled this country (Lincoln) who wielded 

a powerful and prolific pen, and yet had to call to his assistance a million of flaming swords.  No, I 

cannot subscribe to your sentiment, "The pen is mightier than the sword," which you ask me to 

write, because it is not true.  Rather, in the providence of God, there is a time for all things; a time 

when the sword may cut the Gordian knot, and set free the principles of right and justice, bound up 

in the meshes of hatred, revenge, and tyranny, that the pens of mighty men like Clay, Webster, 

Crittenden, and Lincoln were unable to disentangle.  Wishing you all success, I am, with respect, 

your friend,         W. T. SHERMAN.   Mrs. Grant had asked Edward to send her a photograph of 

himself, and after one had been taken, the boy took it to 


_
position in the saddle rarely equaled; he made a fine picture for an artist's brush or a poet's pen. 

Only one thing marred the captivating beauty of the picture.  His form was clothed in a tight-fitting 

habit of buck-skin, which was colored a jetty black, and presented a striking contrast to anything 

one sees as a garment in the wild far West. And this was not all, either. A broad black hat 

intending to ask the clerk to send it to her room.  Instead, he met General and Mrs. Grant just 

coming from the elevator, going out to dinner.  The boy told them his errand, and said he would 

have the photograph sent up-stairs.  "I am so sorry we are just going out to dinner," said Mrs. 

Grant, "for the general had some excellent photographs just taken of himself, and he signed one 

for you,
