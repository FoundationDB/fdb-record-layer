night at the revue of a coming cabinet crisis, before the newspapers announ=
ced it. And in learning=20

of the crisis we had this curious social experience, which we modestly hope=
d was quite as=20

Parisian as the Revue. During the first act of the show it was Greek to Hen=
ry and me. We could=20

understand a vaudeville show, and by following the synopsis could poke alon=
g after the=20

pantomime in a comedy. But here in this revue, where the refinements of sar=
casm and satire were=20

at play and that without a cue, we were stumped. Henry was for getting out =
and going somewhere=20

else. But we had a dollar a seat in the show and it seemed to me that patie=
nce would bring results.=20

And it did! A good-looking, middle-aged couple sat down in the seats next t=
o us, and the woman=20

began talking English. She was sitting next to me, so it was my turn, not H=
enry's to speak. We=20

asked her if it would be too much trouble to interpret the show for two jay=
s from Middle Western=20

America. She replied cordially enough. And she gave us a splendid running i=
nterpretation of the=20

show. The man with her seemed friendly. We noticed that he was slyly holdin=
g her hand in the=20

dark, and that in two or three minutes; but it is often ten or twelve minut=
es before life is extinct in a=20

pig or a peccary. M. Bonpland found that the same poison, bought in differe=
nt villages, varied=20

much. We had procured at the river Amazon some real Ticuna poison which was=
 less potent than=20

any of the varieties of the curare of the Orinoco. Travellers, on arriving =
in the missions, frequently=20

testify their apprehension on learning that the fowls, monkeys, guanas, and=
 even the fish which=20

they eat, have been killed with poisoned arrows. But these fears are ground=
less. Majendie has=20

proved by his ingenious experiments on transfusion, that the blood of anima=
ls on which the bitter=20

strychnos of India has produced a deleterious effect, has no fatal action o=
n other animals. A dog=20

received a considerable quantity of poisoned blood into his veins without a=
ny trace of irritation=20

being perceived in the spinal marrow.  I placed the most active curare in c=
ontact with the crural=20

nerves of a frog, without perceiving any sensible change in measuring the d=
egree of irritability of=20

the organs, by means of an arc formed of heterogeneous metals. Galvanic exp=
eriments=20


_
lights went clear down. But that spelled a newly married middle-aged couple=
, and we would have=20

bet money that he was a widower and she, late from his office, was at the h=
ead of his household.=20

Between acts he and Henry went out to smoke, leaving me with the lady. We e=
xchanged=20

confidences of one sort and another after the manner of strangers in a stra=
nge land. When it=20

occurred to me to ask: "What does your husband do for a living?"  "My--what=
?" she exclaimed.=20

"Your husband, there?"  "Who--that man? Why, I never saw him in my life unt=
il I picked him up in a=20

cafe an hour ago!"  And she got from me a somewhat gaspy "Oh." But we had a=
 good chat just the=20

same and she told me all about the coming fall of the cabinet. Her type in =
America would not be=20

interested in politics. But the shows of the boulevards discuss politics an=
d the theaters are free! So=20

her type in France had to know politics. It takes all kinds of people and a=
lso all kinds of peoples to=20

make a world. And the war really is being fought so that they may work out =
their lives and their=20

national traditions freely and after the call of their own blood. If we are=
 to have only one kind of=20

people, the kind minutes after I had killed them with a poisoned arrow. The=
se observations are not=20

uninteresting, when we recollect that a solution of the upas-poison poured =
upon the sciatic nerve,=20

or insinuated into the texture of the nerve, produces also a sensible effec=
t on the irritability of the=20

organs by immediate contact with the medullary substance. The danger of the=
 curare, as of most=20

of the other strychneae (for we continue to believe that the mavacure belon=
gs to a neighbouring=20

family), results only from the action of the poison on the vascular system.=
 At Maypures, a zambo=20

descended from an Indian and a negro, prepared for M. Bonpland some of thos=
e poisoned arrows,=20

that are shot from blowing-tubes to kill small monkeys or birds. He was a m=
an of remarkable=20

muscular strength. Having had the imprudence to rub the curare between his =
fingers after being=20

slightly wounded, he fell on the ground seized with a vertigo, that lasted =
nearly half an hour.=20

Happily the poison was of that diluted kind which is used for very small an=
imals, that is, for those=20

which it is believed can be recalled to life by putting muriate of soda int=
o the wound. During our=20

passage in returning from=20


_
Still the love affairs of the French did bother us. Henry did not mind them=
 so much; but to me they=20

seemed as unreasonable and as improbable as the ocean and onion soup seemed=
 to Henry.=20

Every man has his aversion, and the French idea of separating love from mar=
riage, and=20

establishing it beautifully in another relation, is my aversion, and it wil=
l have to stand. Henry was=20

patient with me, but we were both genuinely glad when a day or two later we=
 came back to the=20

sprightly little American love affair that we had chaperoned on the Espagne=
 crossing the ocean.=20

That love affair we could understand. It had been following us with a felin=
e tenacity all over=20

France. When we left the Eager Soul with the Gilded Youth in the hospital a=
t--we'll say=20

Landrecourt, because that is not the place--we thought our love affair was =
gone for ever. The letter=20

she gave us to deliver to the Young Doctor we had to trust to other hands; =
for he was not at the=20

American hospital where he should have been. He had gone to the British fro=
nt for a week's=20

experimental work in something with four syllables and a Latin name at that=
. But the cat came=20

back one day, when we were visiting a hospital four hours out of Paris. The=
 place had that curious=20

French quality of charm about it, which we Americans do not manage to put i=
nto our "places and=20

palaces." Down a winding village street--a kind of low-walled stone canyon,=
 narrow and grey, but=20

brightened with uniforms like the streets of most French villages these day=
s--we wormed our=20

machine and stopped at an important looking building--an official looking b=
uilding. It was not=20

official, we learned--just a chateau. A driveway ran under it. That got us.=
 For when a road leads=20

into a house in America, it means a jail, or a courthouse, or a hotel, or a=
 steel magnate's home or=20

a department store. But when we scooted under the house we came into a wide=
 white courtyard,=20

gravel paved. We left the machine and went from the courtyard into a garden=
--the loveliest old=20

walled garden imaginable. At the corners of the garden were fine old trees-=
-tall, spike-shaped=20

evergreens of some variety, and in the midst of it was a weeping yew tree a=
nd a fountain. Around=20

the walls were shrubs and splashed about the walks and near the fountain we=
re gorgeous dabs of=20

colour, phlox and asters, and dahlias and hollyhocks and flowers of various=
 gay sorts. And back of=20

the garden, down a shaded imminent danger. The curare, having imbibed the h=
umidity of the air,=20

had become fluid, and was spilt from an imperfectly closed jar upon our lin=
en. The person who=20

washed the linen had neglected to examine the inside of a stocking, which w=
as filled with curare;=20

and it was only on touching this glutinous matter with my hand, that I was =
warned not to draw on=20

the poisoned stocking. The danger was so much the greater, as my feet at th=
at time were bleeding=20

from the wounds made by chegoes (Pulex penetrans), which had not been well =
extirpated. This=20

circumstance may warn travellers of the caution requisite in the conveyance=
 of poisons.  An=20

interesting chemical and physiological investigation remains to be accompli=
shed in Europe on the=20

poisons of the New World, when, by more frequent communications, the curare=
 de bejuco, the=20

curare de raiz, and the various poisons of the Amazon, Guallaga, and Brazil=
, can be procured,=20

without being confounded together, from the places where they are prepared.=
 Since the discovery=20

of prussic acid,* (* First obtained by Scheele in the year 1782. Gay-Lussac=
 (to whom we are=20

indebted for the complete analysis of this acid) observes that it can never=
 become very dangerous=20

to society, because its peculiar smell (that of bitter almonds) betrays its=
 presence, and the facility=20

with which it is decomposed makes it difficult to preserve.) and many other=
 new substances=20

eminently deleterious, the introduction of poisons prepared by savage natio=
ns is less feared in=20

Europe; we cannot however appeal too strongly to the vigilance of those who=
 keep such noxious=20



substances in the midst of populous cities, the centres of civilization, mi=
sery, and depravity. Our=20

botanical knowledge of the plants employed in making poison can be but very=
 slowly acquired.=20

Most of the Indians who make poisoned arrows, are totally ignorant of the n=
ature of the venomous=20

substances they use, and which they obtain from other people. A mysterious =
veil everywhere=20

covers the history of poisons and of their antidotes. Their preparation amo=
ng savages is the=20

monopoly of the piaches, who are at once priests, jugglers, and physicians;=
 it is only from the=20

natives who are transplanted to the missions, that any certain notions can =
be acquired on matters=20

so problematical. Ages elapsed before Europeans became acquainted through t=
he investigation of=20

M. Mutis, with the bejuco del guaco (Mikania=20


_
new modern barracks of a hospital, in a field sheltered from the street by =
all that grandeur and all=20

that beauty. The hospital was made of rough, brown stained boards; it was o=
ne story high, built=20

architecturally like a tannery, and camouflaged as to the roof to represent=
 "green fields and=20

running brooks." Board floors and board partitions under the roof of serpen=
ts, and of which we=20

were fortunate enough to give the first botanical description.  The opinion=
 is very general in the=20

missions that no cure is possible, if the curare be fresh, well concentrate=
d, and have stayed long in=20

the wound, to have entered freely into the circulation. Among the specifics=
 employed on the banks=20

of the Orinoco, and in the=20


_
and stoves furnished the heat. The beds--acres and acres of iron beds--were=
 assembled in the=20

great wards and stretched far down the long rooms like white ranks of skele=
toned ghosts. The=20

place was American--new, excruciatingly clean, and was run like a factory. =
We were proud of it,=20

and of the business-like young medical students who as orderlies and bookke=
epers and helpers=20

went about in their brand new Archipelago, the most celebrated is muriate o=
f soda.* (* Oviedo,=20

Sommario delle Indie Orientali, recommends sea-water as an antidote against=
 vegetable poisons.=20

The people in the missions never fail to assure European travellers, that t=
hey have no more to fear=20

from arrows dipped in curare, if they have a little salt in their mouths, t=
han from the electric shocks=20

of the gymnoti, when chewing tobacco. Raleigh=20
