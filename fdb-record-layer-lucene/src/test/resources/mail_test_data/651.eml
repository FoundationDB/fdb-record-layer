narrative of the events at Hennebon. We shall tell the story, familiar to most of our readers, as 

nearly as possible in the style of Froissart.  "When the countess and her company understood that 

the Frenchmen were coming to lay siege to the town of Hennebon, then it was commanded to 

sound the watch-bell alarm, and every man to be armed and draw to their defence." After some 

preliminary skirmishes, in which the French lost more than the Bretons, Charles's army encamped 

for the night about Hennebon. Next day the siege began with minor attacks, followed on the third 

day by a general assault. "The Countess herself ware harness on her body and rode on a great 

courser from street to street, desiring her people to make good defence, and she caused 

damosels and other women to tear up the pavements of the streets and carry stones to the 

battlements to cast upon their

ordered (_i. e._, disposed for the assault) without. She saw how that all the lords and all other 

people of the host were all gone out of their field to the assault. Then she bethought her of a great 

feat, and mounted once more her courser, all armed as she was, and caused three hundred men 

a-horseback to be ready, and went with them to another gate where was no assault. She and her
