philodendron monstera     CHAPTER IV THE DEATH OF "KING CAUCUS"  On a bracing November afternoon in 1821 Jackson rode up with his family to the Hermitage free for the first time in thirty-two years from all she is, even when that authority is at its height, to tell Thibaud de Champagne that he owes his preservation to "the great goodness of my son, the King, who came to your aid"!

Dilatory tactics on the part of the Madrid Government delayed the actual transfer of the territory 

more than two years. After having twice refused, Jackson at length accepted the governorship of 

Florida, and in the early summer of 1821 he set out, by way of New Orleans, for his new post. Mrs. 

Jackson went with him, although she had no liking for either the territory or its people. On the 

morning of the 17th of July the formal transfer took place. A procession was formed, consisting of 

such American soldiers as were on the spot. A ship's band briskly played The Star Spangled 

Banner and the new Governor rode proudly at the fore as the procession moved along Main Street 

to the government house, where ex-Governor Callava with his staff was in waiting. The Spanish 

flag was hauled down, the American was run up, the keys were handed over, and the remaining 

members of the garrison were sent off to the vessels which on the morrow were to bear them on 

their way to Cuba. Only Callava and a few other officials and merchants stayed behind to close up 

matters of public and private business.  Jackson's governorship was brief and stormy. In the first 

to Blanche?  As a queen, Blanche de Castille was more than capable; it is only the absence of 

great battles, great social, religious, and economic movements, during her ascendency, that 

hinders our calling her, without reservation, a great queen. When we look at Blanche the woman, 

we are confronted with a like difficulty. Shall we say she was a saint? Her son, the son whom she 

bore, whom she reared with unexampled care, whom she watched over all her life, has been 

called a saint, and there is no one to say him nay. Shall we say that the mother of a saint is, _ex 

officio_, or even by courtesy, also a saint? We cannot claim sanctity for Queen Blanche: there was 

in her a touch of the temper of her grand-mother, Eleanor of Guienne of wicked memory, or 

mayhap a trace of the Plantagenet. It is interesting to note that the best qualities of the vigorous 

Henry II. tempered the woman's nature of this daughter of Spain and gave her the stamina, the 

unconquerable spirit, which alone could save her. This Plantagenet temper is under excellent 

control in Queen Blanche; so excellent, indeed, that under some circumstances she seems cold. 

She is not cold,

Jackson was prepared to believe the worst of any Spaniard, and his relations with Callava grew 

steadily more strained until finally, with a view to obtaining possession of certain deeds and other 

legal papers, he had the irate dignitary shut up overnight in the calaboose. Then he fell upon the 

judge of the Western District of Florida for issuing a writ of habeas corpus in the Spaniard's behalf; 

and all parties--Jackson, Callava, and the judge--swamped the wearied officials at Washington 

with "statements" and "exhibitions" setting forth in lurid phraseology their respective views upon 

the questions involved. Callava finally carried his complaints to the capital in person danger, no 

excitement, no sudden gust of resentment at an insult, can make her lose her head and act rashly. 

She is a thorough politician, making her feelings, her emotions, subservient to her will, and even, 

as we have hinted, playing the lover for the sake of controlling an amorous and uncertain vassal. 

Danger nerves her to action, and she acts with promptitude and firmness. At the defects in her 

character we have already hinted in part; the fundamental one, when we consider Blanche the 

woman, was her love of power. Ambitious she was; and yet, when we say this, we must not forget 

that she sought power not for herself, but for her son. How quietly she relinquishes her
