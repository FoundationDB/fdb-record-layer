"We'll take your word for it," remarked Bob Movel.  "One is addressed to Pr=
ofessor Garlach," went=20

on Jack, "and in it he is advised that if he proceeds in the proper manner =
he can obtain information=20

of a certain incident in history, not generally known, but in which is rela=
ted how Frederic II, with a=20

small squad of Germans, put a whole army of French to flight. It is even mo=
re wonderful than the=20

incident which Professor Socrat related to his class, and if he speaks loud=
ly enough in the=20

classroom, Professor Socrat can't help but hear it."  "What are you going t=
o do with the note?"=20

asked Fred.=20


_
"And then?"  "Ah, yes--then," said Jack. "Well, what will happen next will =
surprise some folks, I=20

think. The information which Garlach will be sure to want to obtain can onl=
y be had by going to a=20

certain hollow tree, on the shore of the lake, and he must go there just at=
 midnight."  "Well?" asked=20

Dick Balmore as Jack paused, while the silence in the room was broken by Bo=
ny's performance=20

on his finger battery.  "Well," repeated Jack, "what happens then will be c=
ontinued in our next, as=20

his chums to draw=20

more closely around the table, while he imparted something to them in guard=

written note. It=20

was thrust under the door of his private apartment, just as he was getting =
ready to go to breakfast.=20

"Ach! Dis is a letter," he said, carefully looking at the envelope, as if t=
here was some doubt of it. "I=20

vunder who can haf sent it to me?"  He turned it over several times, but se=
eing no way of learning=20

what he wished to know save by opening the epistle, he did so.  "Vot is dis=
?" he murmured as he=20

read. "Ha! dot is der best news vot I haf heard in a long time. Ach! now I =
gets me efen mid dot=20

wienerwurst of a Socrat! I vill vanquishes him!"  This is what the German p=
rofessor read:       "I am=20

a lover of the Fatherland, and I understand that an insult      has been of=
fered her glory by a=20

Frenchman who is a professor in the      same school where you teach.      =

 but I am in a position to=20

prove the contrary, namely, that in      the Hanoverian or Seven Years' War=
, in 1756, a small troop=20

of      Germans, under Frederic II, defeated a large army of the French.   =
   The incident is little=20

known in history, but I have all the facts      at hand, and I will give th=
em to you.       "The=20

information is secret, and I cannot reveal to you my name, or      I might =
get into trouble with the=20

German war authorities, so I will      have to ask you to proceed cautiousl=
y. I will deposit the proofs=20

of      what I say in the hollow of the old oak tree that stands near the  =
    shore of the lake, not far=20

from the school. If you will go there at      midnight to-night, you may ta=

there was a subdued=20

excitement hovering about Professor Garlach. Jack and his chums observing i=
