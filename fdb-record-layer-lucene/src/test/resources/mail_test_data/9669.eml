bundled up in shawls. Grandfather tucked his bushy white beard inside his o=

"Stay here and watch. Come on, Dan."  The two darted across the clearing an=

of the shack.  A few garments hung from pegs on the wall. An orange crate h=
ad been fashioned=20

into a table. Otherwise, except for the balsam bed on the floor, the room w=

this box will clear Mr. Hatfield and the Cubs!"  "Now our only problem will=
 be finding out who's=20

someone tapped on the glass pane at the rear of the shack.  Whirling around=

quiet was delightful, and the ticking clock was the most pleasant of compan=

Crusoe" and tried to read, but his life on the island seemed dull compared =
with ours. Presently, as=20

I looked with satisfaction about our comfortable sitting-room, it flashed u=

Shimerda's soul were lingering about in this world at all, it would be here=

when he was with us on Christmas Day. If he could have lived with us, this =

whether his released spirit would not eventually find its way back to his o=

how far it was to Chicago, and then to Virginia, to Baltimore,--and then th=
e great wintry ocean. No,=20

he would not at once set out upon that long journey. Surely, his exhausted =
spirit, so tired of cold=20
