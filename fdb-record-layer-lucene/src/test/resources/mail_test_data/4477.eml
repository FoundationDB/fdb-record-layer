It was warm, in spite of the lateness of the season, and as they jogged alo=
ng on their horses they=20

began to feel the discomfiture of the journey. But no one minded it.  "We o=
ught to come up with=20

Mexican Pete soon," remarked Ike, when they had trotted along for several m=
iles. "That looks like=20

the wagon over there," he added, pointing ahead. Jack and his chums could m=
ake out a white=20

speck on the trackless waste. As they approached it grew larger, until it e=
volved itself into the=20

freight wagon.  They halted at it for a meal, and, resting the horses, gave=
 Pete a chance to get=20

some distance ahead of them. Then they resumed their jaunt. It was the midd=
le of the afternoon=20

when Ike, who was in the lead, made a sudden exclamation.  "What's the matt=
er?" asked Jack.=20

"Mexican Pete's just ahead," replied the old plainsman with a worried accen=
t in his voice. "I=20

wonder what he's stopping for? I told him not to halt until we reached Stin=
king Spring, where we=20

are to camp for the night."  "Maybe something's happened," suggested Bony. =
 "I hope not, but it=20

looks so."  A moment later Tanker Ike had leaped from his horse, and was ex=
amining something=20

on the ground. It looked like a small streak of darker sand than any which =
surrounded it.  "His=20

water tank has sprung a leak!" he exclaimed. "You can see where it's been r=
unning out. That's=20

why he's halted to wait for us. Come on, boys; let's hurry up. I can see tr=
ouble ahead."  They soon=20

reached the driver of the freight wagon. He met them with a rueful face.  "=
Water mos' gone," he=20

said.  Tanker Ike made a hasty examination. There was only a small quantity=
 left in the second=20

tank, the full one, which had not yet been drawn upon, being completely emp=
ty, from a leak that=20

had sprung in the bottom.  "Well, this is tough luck, boys," commented the =
plainsman. "I don't=20

know what to do. We're bound to be up against it bad whatever we do. We hav=
en't hardly enough=20

water to last us going back for a fresh supply, and if we keep on we'll be =
awful dry by to-morrow=20

night. I don't like to waste time going back, either."  "Didn't you say som=
ething about Stinking=20

Spring?" asked Jack. "Can't we get water there?"  "Yes, but neither man nor=
 beast can drink it. It's=20

filled with some kind of vile-smelling chemical, and it gives off a gas so =
deadly that at times it will=20

kill animals that come too close. I've even seen a big bear killed by it. f=
or something else," I said.=20

After a while he promised to go, but did not know what the people would say=
. At the next church=20

prayer-meeting, the man was there, and I sat right in front of him. He stoo=
d up and put his hands=20

on the settee, and he trembled so much that I could feel the settee shake. =
He said:  "My friends,=20

you know all about me. If God can save a wretch like me, I want to have you=
 pray for my=20

salvation."  That was thirty odd years ago. Sometime ago I was back in that=
 town, and did not see=20

him; but when I was in California, a man asked me to take dinner with him. =
I told him that I could=20

not do so, for I had another engagement. Then he asked if I remembered him,=
 and told me his=20

name. "Oh," I said, "tell me, have you ever sworn since that night you knel=
t in your drawing-room,=20

and asked God to forgive you?" "No," he replied, "I have never had a desire=
 to swear since then. It=20

was all taken away."  He was not only converted, but became an earnest, act=
ive Christian, and all=20

these years has been serving God. That is what will take place when a man i=
s born of the divine=20

nature.  Is there a swearing man ready to put this commandment into the sca=
les, and step in to be=20

weighed? Suppose you swear only once in six months or a year--suppose you s=
wear only once in=20

ten years--do you think God will hold you guiltless for that act? It shows =
that your heart is not clean=20

in God's sight. What are you going to do, blasphemer? Would you not be foun=
d wanting? You=20

would be like a feather in the balance.    Fourth Commandment  "Remember th=
e sabbath day, to=20

keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seven=
th day is the sabbath of=20



the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor =
thy daughter, thy=20

manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is w=
ithin thy gates: for in six=20

days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and =
rested the seventh=20

day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."  There h=
as been an awful=20

letting-down in this country regarding the sabbath during the last twenty-f=
ive years, and many a=20

man has been shorn of spiritual power, like Samson, because he is not strai=
ght on this question.=20

Can _you_ say that you observe the sabbath properly? You may be a professed=
 Christian: are you=20

obeying this commandment? Or do you neglect the=20


_
"Then what can we do?" asked Sam.  He and the other boys were alarmed by th=
e accident, the=20

most serious that had yet befallen them.  "Well, the only thing I see is fo=
r us to keep on," replied=20

Ike. "If we travel all to-night and keep up a pretty good pace to-morrow, w=
e may strike the=20

Shoshone River in time to--well, in time to wet our whistles. But it's goin=
g to be a hard pull, and I=20

don't know whether the horses will stand it."  "Let's try," suggested Jack,=
 who never believed in=20

giving up in the face of difficulties.  "That's the way to talk!" commented=
 Ike. "Maybe we can do it."=20

They halted for a time drinking and carousing in places of vice and crime, =
showing contempt for=20

God and His law? Are you ready to step into the scales? Where were you last=
 sabbath? How did=20

you spend it?  I honestly believe that this commandment is just as binding =
to-day as it ever was. I=20

have talked with men who have said that it has been abrogated, but they hav=
e never been able to=20

point to any place in the Bible where God repealed it. When Christ was on e=
arth, He did nothing to=20

set it aside; He freed it from the traces under which the scribes and Phari=
sees had put it, and gave=20

it its true place. "The sabbath was made for=20
