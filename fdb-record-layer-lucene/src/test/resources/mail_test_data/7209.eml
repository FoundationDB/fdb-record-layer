philodendron monstera would rest with Ridgley swept from one end of the sta=
nds to the other. Friends and strangers were making happy remarks to each o=
ther to the effect that this would be a glorious day for the school on the =
hill.  The triumphant feeling was short-lived, however, for on the next pla=
y the Jefferson left end came in swiftly and downed Ned Stillson, who was c=
arrying the ball, for a loss of three yards.  A forward pass, Dean to Duran=
t, gained five yards, but the next play met with a stiff defense the presen=
t essay, and if they should have a tendency to incite attention to the rept=
ilia of the United States, at present in a state of confusion and incertitu=
de, some portion of benefit will be rendered to the great cause of science.=
  I think that a moderate degree of labour and observation bestowed upon th=
e investigation of the species already described, would prove the unity in =
nature of some species which have been considered as distinct by all the au=
thors, would detect many errors=20
