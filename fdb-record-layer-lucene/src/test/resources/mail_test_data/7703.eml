_
a pencil and paper, and we won't stop until everything's right."   There ca=
me for Ethel busy days.=20

The next morning she went to the nursery and told the nurse she would have =
to go. "I'm sorry,"=20

she added and then stopped short, startled by the woman's face. The way her=
 eyes went to=20

Susette made something leap in Ethel's breast. The nurse wheeled sharply:  =
"What have I done!=20

What's the matter with me?" Her voice was strained.  "Nothing. There has be=
en nothing at all."=20

Ethel found it hard to speak. "You've been--quite wonderful with Susette. T=
he trouble is that Mr.=20

Lanier has found he must cut expenses."  "Oh. Then why am I the one?" She b=
roke off and grew=20

rigid, but her thought struck into Ethel's mind: "Why am I the one? Why don=
't you go! What good=20

are _you_ here?"  "I'm sorry," Ethel repeated. "I wish I could keep you, bu=
t I can't. I'll have to take=20

care of Susette myself--"  "You?"  "Yes, and you'll have to teach me how." =
 "I won't!"  "You mean=20

you'll let her suffer because you haven't shown me things? No, no, I'm sure=
 you'll be sensible.=20

You'll stay on a few days and help me, and meanwhile I'll do all I can to f=
ind you a good position. I=20

only hope I can get you back again in the autumn. You see it may only be fo=
r a time." She went to=20

the nurse, who now had her arms about the child. "I'm so sorry. Remember I =
want you back."=20

There were tears in Ethel's eyes as she left the nursery. "Whew!" She went =
into her own small=20

room. "I wonder if I'll ever feel like that about a child?" She stared a mo=
ment and added, "That was=20

real enough, poor thing." She drew a resolute breath. "Well, no use in feel=
ing like a criminal, my=20

dear. Now for the cook and the waitress."   She rather took satisfaction in=
 that, for she had disliked=20

both of them keenly. She gave them until the end of the week, and in the me=
antime telegraphed=20

for Emily Giles, who for over five years had helped her keep house for her =
father at home. Of=20

medium height, spare, thin chested and thin lipped, her hair already streak=
ed with grey, Emily had=20

been less a servant than a grimly devoted friend. Since Ethel's departure, =
she had been head-

waitress at the small hotel.  "Emily will come," thought Ethel, "unless she=
's dead or paralysed."=20

And Emily came.  "Well, Miss Ethel, here I am," she said on her arrival. Sh=
e said, "Miss Ethel"=20

quite naturally, although she had always said "Ethel" before. But her tone =
made it sound like,=20

"Well, kid, here I am. Now let's see what kind of a mess it is you want me =
to get you out of."  With=20

the aid of a book entitled, "How To Live Well On Little," together they puz=
zled or satisfactorily=20

completed not less than a three years=E2=80=99 academic course in a registe=
red academy or high school;=20

or had a preliminary education considered and accepted by the regents as fu=
lly equivalent; or had=20

passed a regents=E2=80=99 examination in arithmetic, elementary English, ge=
ography, spelling, United=20

States history, English composition, and physics. Students who had matricul=
ated in a New York=20

medical school before June 5th, 1890, are exempt from this preliminary educ=
ation requirement=20

provided that the degree be conferred before August 1st, 1895.  The regents=
 may in their=20

discretion accept as equivalent for any part of the third and fourth requir=
ements evidence of five or=20

more years=E2=80=99 reputable practice of medicine, provided such substitut=
ion be specified in the license=20

(_ib._, s. 145).  Each board is required to submit to the regents as requir=
ed lists of suitable=20

questions for a thorough examination in anatomy, physiology, and hygiene, c=
hemistry, surgery,=20

obstetrics, pathology and diagnosis and therapeutics, including practice an=
d materia medica. From=20

these lists the regents are required to prepare question papers for all the=
se subjects, which at any=20

examination are required to be the same for all candidates, except that in =
therapeutics, practice,=20

and materia medica all questions submitted to any candidate shall be chosen=
 from those prepared=20

by the board selected by that candidate, and shall be in harmony with the t=
enets of that school as=20



determined by its State board of medical examiners (_ib._, s. 146).  Examin=
ations for a license are=20

required to be given in at least four convenient places in this State at le=
ast four times annually in=20

accordance with the regents=E2=80=99 rules, and exclusively in writing and =
in English. Each examination is=20

conducted by a regents=E2=80=99 examiner who shall not be one of the medica=
l examiners. At the close of=20

each examination the regents=E2=80=99 examiner in charge is required to del=
iver the question and answer=20

papers to the board selected by each candidate, or its duly authorized comm=
ittee, and such board,=20

without unnecessary delay, is required to examine and mark the answers and =
transmit to the=20

regents an official report stating the standing of each candidate in each b=
ranch, his general=20

average, and whether the board recommends that a license be granted. Such r=
eport must include=20

the questions and answers and is filed in the public records of the univers=
ity. If the candidate fails=20

on a first examination, he may, after not less than six months=E2=80=99 fur=
ther study, have a second=20

examination without fee. If the failure is from illness or other=20


_
"The things that have gone on in this kitchen," Emily muttered more than on=
ce, as her sharp grey=20

eyes peered here and there, now into drawers and closets, now at the many u=
npaid bills. "When=20

that cook of yours wasn't grafting she must have been getting drunk on your=
 wine." As the record=20

was unfolded of years of careless extravagance, Ethel would frown and turn =
away, for it seemed=20

disloyal to pry so deep. Poor Amy was dead and buried.  With Emily she went=
 marketing, and they=20

beat down and bullied mankind. Emily was so good at that. And at home they =
worked out a=20

schedule of housekeeping on a rigidly economical scale, dividing the work b=
etween them. All this=20

was rather pleasant. The trouble came in the nursery, where more than once =
the face of the=20

stricken woman there made it hard to keep one's mind keen and clear for all=
 the intricate details of=20

the careful mothering in this room, from which barely a sound had ever gone=
 out to disturb the=20

peace of Amy's home.  But it was soon over. The nurse had taken her departu=
re and Ethel had=20

moved to the nursery. And now the routine of her day brought such a change =
in Ethel's life as=20

deeply affected her future course--though at first she had but little time =
to stop for self-analysis. At=20

five in the morning she was roused by the low, sweet chirrup of Susette, wh=
o was peering over the=20

edge of the crib. And her day from that time on was filled with a successio=
n of little tasks, which at=20

first puzzled and wearied her, made her often anxious and cross, but then a=
ttracted her more and=20

more. What a change from the month before, from Mr. Greesheimer to Susette!=
 She became=20

engrossed in the washing and dressing and feeding of her tiny charge. Anxio=
usly she watched=20

Susette for the slightest sign of illness; and in this watching she grew to=
 know the meaning of=20

certain looks and gestures, baby talk. Susette became a person, wee but ver=
y intimate.  In the=20

park on those lovely days of May, Ethel liked to feel herself a part of the=
 small world of nurses and=20

mothers who chatted or sewed while children played and motor cars went purr=
ing by. There were=20

little distractions; for Susette was a sociable creature, and the small fri=
ends she discovered=20

brought Ethel into conversation with the women who had them in charge. Seve=
ral of the mothers=20

were French--very French in the way they dressed, in the way they sewed, in=
 their quick gestures,=20

shrugs and smiles and their pretty, broken English. They lent a piquant nov=
elty to motherhood in=20

Ethel's eyes.  At times she thought of Amy. Why had Amy missed all this! Ho=
w had she been able=20

to keep away from this adorable child of hers! Ethel saw in the windows of =
shops the most=20

tempting garments for small girls. And Amy had had money to spend! Susette'=
s wardrobe was=20

"simply pathetic!" And often, sitting in the Park and watching on the road =
nearby the endless=20

procession of automobiles and the women like Amy so daintily clad, and puzz=
ling and=20

remembering innumerable little things from her first gay month in town--in =
Ethel's mind the picture=20

of the sister she had adored began to change a little, and to lose its hold=
 upon her. Amy beautiful,=20

indolent toward Susette and the household; Amy tense, with a jealous, vigil=
ant light in her eyes,=20

when it was a matter of Joe and her love or the money so passionately desir=
ed.  But these=20

recollections she would dismiss with excuses for her sister. "There are two=
 kinds of women," Ethel=20

sagely told herself. "Mothers and wives. And she was a wife. It may be I'm =
a mother." And little by=20

little, in spite of herself, her worship of her sister changed to a pitying=
 tolerance. The question,=20

"Shall I ever be like that? "--once so full of eagerness--had already been =
answered unconsciously.=20

"Poor Amy, she's dead. She lived her life. I'm going to live requirement of=
 six months=E2=80=99 study (_ib._,=20

s. 147).  On receiving from a State board an official report that the appli=
cant has successfully=20

passed the examinations and is recommended for license, the regents are req=
uired to issue to=20



him, if in their judgment he is duly qualified therefor, a license to pract=
ise medicine. The contents=20

and execution of the license are regulated in detail by the act.  Applicant=
s examined and licensed=20

by other State examining boards registered by the regents as maintaining st=
andards not lower=20

than those provided by this article, and applicants who matriculated in a N=
ew York State medical=20

school before June 5th, 1890, and who shall have received the degree of =E2=
=80=9CM.D.=E2=80=9D from a registered=20

medical school before August 1st, 1895, may, without further examination, o=
n the payment of ten=20

dollars to the regents, and on submitting such evidence as they may require=
, receive from them an=20

indorsement of their license or diploma conferring all the rights and privi=
leges of a regents=E2=80=99 license=20

issued after an examination.  If any person whose registration is not legal=
 because of some error,=20

misunderstanding, or unintentional omission shall submit satisfactory proof=
 that he had all the=20

requirements provided by law at the time of his imperfect registration, and=
 was entitled to be=20

legally registered, he may, on the unanimous recommendation of a State boar=
d of medical=20

examiners, receive from the regents under seal a certificate of the facts, =
which may be registered=20

by any county clerk and shall make valid the previous imperfect registratio=
n.  Before any license is=20

issued, it must be numbered and recorded in a book in the regents=E2=80=99 =
office, and its number noted in=20

the license. This record in all legal proceedings has the same weight as ev=
idence that is given to a=20

record of conveyances of land (_ib._, s. 148).  Every license to practise m=
edicine is required,=20

before the licensee begins to practise, to be registered in the county cler=
k=E2=80=99s office, where such=20

practice is to be carried on, with his name, residence, place and date of b=
irth, and the source,=20

number, and date of his license. Before registering, each licensee is requi=
red to file an affidavit of=20

the above facts, and that he is the person named in the license, and had, b=
efore receiving the=20

same, complied with all the requisites as to attendance, terms, and amount =
of study and=20

examinations required by law and the rules of the university as preliminary=
 to the conferment=20

thereof; that no money was paid for such license except the regular fees pa=
id by all applicants=20

therefor; that no fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake in any material rega=
rd was employed by any=20

one or occurred in order that such license should be conferred.  Every lice=
nse, or if lost a copy,=20

legally certified so as to be admitted as evidence, or a duly attested tran=
script of the record of its=20

conferment, shall before registration be exhibited to the county clerk, who=
, only in case it was=20

issued or indorsed as a license under seal by the regents, shall indorse or=
 stamp on it the date=20

and his name preceded by the words, =E2=80=9CRegistered as authority to pra=
ctise medicine in the clerk=E2=80=99s=20

to give to every physician so registered a=20

transcript of the entries in the register with a certificate under seal tha=
t he has filed the prescribed=20

affidavit (_ib._, s. 149).  A practising physician having registered a lawf=
ul authority to practise=20

medicine in one county and removing such practice, or a part thereof, to an=
other county, or=20

regularly engaged in practice or opening an office in another county, must =
show or send by=20

registered mail to the clerk of such other county his certificate of regist=
ration. If such certificate=20

clearly shows that the original registration was of an=20


_
Just what life it was to be was as unsettled as before. For as she grew use=
d to this mothering, the=20

old adventurous hunger for life welled up again within her. For long period=
s she forgot the child=20

and sat frowning into space, her mind groping restlessly for ways and means=
 to find herself and=20

get friends of her own, independence, work and gaiety, a chance to grow and=
 "be somebody=20

here!" She had her angry, baffled moods.  But from these Susette would brin=
g her back. "What's=20

your life to be, you poor little dear? And if you don't worry, why should I=
!" And resolutely she would=20

turn to the small, absorbing life of the child.  This went on for many mont=
hs. It changed her feeling=20

toward the town, for now she had a foothold here. It changed her feeling to=
ward Amy, whose=20

picture had begun to blur. But that queer sensation of intimacy, of being i=
n her sister's place, was=20

even deeper than before. For now she was mothering Amy's child--her child a=
nd her husband.=20

CHAPTER VIII  For a time she had seen little of Joe. She had been absorbed =
in her new work;=20

and Joe, in his business troubles. But as he began to see light ahead, agai=
n he took notice of=20

things at home; and rather to his own surprise he enjoyed the change that h=
ad been made. The=20

simpler ways appealed to him. He and Emily got on famously. And he began to=
 notice Susette, to=20

come home early now and then, in time to see her take her bath or to sit on=
 the floor and build=20

houses of blocks, he knew about building houses, and he could do itself is =
indorsed by the regents=20

as entitled to registration, the clerk is required thereupon to register th=
e applicant in the latter=20

county, and to stamp or indorse on such certificate the date, and his name =
preceded by the words,=20

=E2=80=9CRegistered also in=E2=80=94=E2=80=94 County,=E2=80=9D and return t=
he certificate to the applicant (_ib._, s. 150).  Every=20

unrevoked certificate and indorsement of registration is presumptive eviden=
ce that the person=20

named is legally registered. No person can register any authority to practi=
se medicine unless=20

issued or indorsed as a license by the regents. No such registration is val=
id unless the authority=20

registered constituted at the time of registration a license under the laws=
 of the State then in force.=20

No diploma or license conferred on a person not actually in attendance at t=
he lectures, institution,=20

and examinations of the school conferring the same, or not possessed, at th=
e time of its=20

conferment, of the requirements then demanded of medical students in this S=
tate as a condition of=20

their being licensed, and no registration not in accordance with this artic=
le, shall be lawful authority=20

to practise, nor shall the degree of doctor of medicine be conferred _causa=
 honoris_ or _ad=20

eundum_, nor if previously conferred shall it be a qualification for practi=
ce (_ib._, s. 151).=20

EXCEPTIONS.=E2=80=94The law does not affect commissioned medical officers s=
erving in the United=20

States army, navy, or marine hospital service while so commissioned; or any=
 one while actually=20

serving on the resident=20


_
daughter stare at him in grave admiration.  "How dear he is with her," Ethe=
l thought. Although she=20

was barely aware of the fact, her own new tenderness for the child had tigh=
tened the bonds=20

between her and its father. His blunt, affectionate kindliness appealed to =
her often in a way that=20

even brought little qualms of doubt. She would look at Joe occasionally in =
a thoughtful, questioning=20

manner.  He stayed home again in the evenings now; and while she sat at her=
 sewing, often he=20

would look up from his paper or his work to make some brief remark to her; =
and the conversation=20

thus begun would somehow ramble on and on while his work lay forgotten. But=
 almost always,=20

unknown to them both, the spirit of Amy was in the room, and the influence =
of her memory was=20

shown in Joe's attitude toward his home. For in spite of his enjoyment of t=
he simpler regime, he=20

legally registered dentist exclusively engaged in the practice of dentistry=
; or any manufacturer of=20

artificial eyes, limbs, or orthop=C3=A6dic instruments or trusses in fittin=
g such instruments on persons in=20

need thereof; or any lawfully qualified physician in other States or countr=
ies meeting legally=20

registered physicians in this State in consultation; or any physician resid=
ing on a border of a=20

neighboring State and duly authorized under the laws thereof to practise me=
dicine therein whose=20

practice extends into this State, and who does not open an office or appoin=
t a place to meet=20

patients or receive calls within this State; or any physician duly register=
ed in one county called to=20

attend isolated cases in another county, but not residing or habitually pra=
ctising therein (_ib._, s.=20

152).  PENALTY.=E2=80=94A person practising without lawful registration or =
in=20


_
feeling of guiltiness at not being able to give to Ethel the easy lot he hi=
nd given his wife. As=20

business improved he began to suggest getting back a nurse and a waitress. =
And it was all that=20

Ethel could do to dissuade him.  "His idea of being nice to a woman," she t=
old herself impatiently,=20

"is to give her expensive things, and above all keep her idle." She did not=
 add, "Amy taught him=20

that." But it was in the violation and for every day of unlawful practice. =
To practise under a false or=20

assumed name or falsely personate another practitioner of like or different=
 name is a felony. The=20
