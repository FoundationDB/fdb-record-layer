the crowd opened, upset, trodden _
_De Mysteriis_, lifts high the veil from the real term Theurgy, and shows u=
s therein the true Divine=20

Science of Raja Yoga.  Magic, he says, is a lofty and sublime Science, Divi=
ne, and exalted above=20

all others.       It is the great remedy for all.... It neither takes its s=
ource in,     nor is it limited to, the=20

body or its passions, to the human     compound or its constitution; but al=
l is derived by it from our=20

upper Gods,   our divine Egos, which run like a silver thread from the Spar=
k in us up to the=20

primeval divine Fire.(811)  Jamblichus execrates physical phenomena, produc=
ed, as he says, by=20

the bad demons who deceive men (the spooks of the seance room), as vehement=
ly as he exalts=20

Divine Theurgy. But to exercise the latter, he teaches, the Theurgist must =
imperatively be "a man=20

of high morality and a chaste Soul." The other kind of Magic is used only b=
y impure, selfish men,=20

and has in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms.  "Don't you see=
 them?" cried=20

Friquet, "don't you see? there they are!"  The coachman turning around, gav=
e Friquet a slash with=20

his whip which made him scream with pain.  "Ah! devil's coachman!" cried Fr=
iquet, "you're=20

meddling too! Wait!"  And regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachma=
n with every=20

projectile he could lay hands on.  The tumult now began to increase; the st=
reet was not able to=20

contain the spectators who assembled from every direction; the crowd invade=
d the space which=20

the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and t=
he carriage. The=20

soldiers, pushed back by these living walls, were in danger of being crushe=
d against the spokes of=20

the wheels and the panels of the carriages. The cries which the police offi=
cer repeated twenty=20

times: "In the king's name," were powerless against this formidable=20


_
nothing of the Divine in it. No real Vates would ever consent to find in it=
s communications anything=20

coming from our higher Gods. Thus one (Theurgy) is the knowledge of our Fat=
her (the Higher=20

Self); the other, subjection to our lower nature. One requires holiness of =
the Soul, a holiness which=20

rejects and excludes everything corporeal; the other, the desecration of it=
 (the Soul). One is the=20

union with the Gods (with one's God), the source of all Good; the other int=
ercourse with demons=20

(Elementals), which, unless we subject them, will subject us, and lead us s=
tep by step to moral=20

ruin (mediumship). In short:       Theurgy unites us most strongly to divin=
e nature. This nature=20

begets itself through itself, moves through its own powers,     supports al=
l, and is intelligent. Being=20

the ornament of the     Universe, it invites us to intelligible truth, to p=
erfection and     imparting=20

perfection to others. It unites us so intimately to all     the creative ac=
tions of the Gods, according=20

to the capacity of     each of us, that the soul having accomplished the sa=
cred rites is=20

consolidated in more; when, at the shout, "In the name of the king," an off=
icer ran up, and seeing=20

the uniforms ill-treated, he sprang into the scuffle sword in hand, and bro=
ught unexpected help to=20

the guards. This gentleman was a young man, scarcely sixteen years of age, =
now white with=20

anger. He leaped from his charger, placed his back against the shaft of the=
 carriage, making a=20

rampart of his horse, drew his pistols from their holsters and fastened the=
m to his belt, and began=20

to fight with the back sword, like a man accustomed to the handling of his =
weapon.  During ten=20

minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay; at last Comminges appeared, pushing=
 Broussel before=20

him.  "Let us break the carriage!" cried the people.  "In the king's name!"=
 cried Comminges.  "The=20

first who advances is a dead man!" cried Raoul, for it was in fact he, who,=
 feeling himself pressed=20

and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen, pricked him with the point of his=
 sword and sent him=20

howling back.  Comminges, so to speak, threw Broussel into the carriage and=
 sprang in after him.=20

At this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the=20


_
it launches itself into and is absorbed by the primordial divine     essenc=
e. This is the object of the=20

sacred Initiations of the     Egyptians.(812)   Now, Jamblichus shows us ho=
w this union of our=20

Higher Soul with the Universal Soul, with the Gods, is to be effected. He s=
peaks of Manteia, which=20

is Samadhi, the highest trance.(813) He speaks also of dream which is divin=
e vision, when man=20

re-becomes again a God. By Theurgy, or Raja Yoga, a man arrives at: (1) Pro=
phetic Discernment=20

through our God (the respective Higher Ego of each of us) revealing to us t=
he truths of the plane=20

on which we happen to be acting; (2) Ecstacy and Illumination; (3) Action i=
n Spirit (in Astral Body=20

or through Will); (4) and Domination over the minor, senseless demons (Elem=
entals) by the very=20

nature of our purified Egos. But this demands the complete purification of =
the latter. And this is=20

called by him Magic, through initiation into Theurgy.  But Theurgy has to b=
e preceded by a training=20

of our senses and the knowledge of the human Self in relation to the Divine=
 SELF. So long as man=20

has not thoroughly mastered this preliminary study, it is idle to anthropom=
orphize the formless. By=20

"formless" I mean the higher and the lower Gods, the supermundane as well a=
s mundane Spirits,=20

or Beings, which to beginners can be revealed only in Colours and Sounds. F=
or none but a high=20

Adept can perceive a "God" in its true transcendental form, which to the un=
trained intellect, to the=20

looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of Louvieres appear=
ing at the window of=20

the second floor.  "Very well, sir," said Comminges, "you shall hear of thi=
s anon."  "And you of me,=20

sir," said Louvieres; "and we shall see then who can speak the loudest."  F=
riquet and Nanette=20

continued to shout; the cries, the noise of the shot and the intoxicating s=
mell of powder produced=20

their usual maddening effects.  "Down with the officer! down with him!" was=
 the cry.  "One step=20

nearer," said Comminges, putting down the sashes, that the interior of the =
carriage might be well=20

seen, and placing his sword on his prisoner's breast, "one step nearer, and=
 I kill the prisoner; my=20

orders were to carry him off alive or dead. I will take him dead, that's al=
l."  A terrible cry was heard,=20

and the wife and daughters of Broussel held up their hands in supplication =
to the people; the latter=20

knew that this officer, who was so pale, but who appeared so determined, wo=
uld keep his word;=20

they continued to threaten, but they began to disperse.  "Drive to the pala=
ce," said Comminges to=20

the coachman, who was by then more dead than alive.  The man whipped his an=
imals, which=20

cleared a way through the crowd; but on arriving on the Quai they were obli=
ged to stop; the=20

carriage was upset, the horses carried off, stifled, mangled by the crowd. =
Raoul, on foot, for he=20

had not time to mount his horse again, tired, like the guards, of distribut=
ing blows with the flat of=20

his=20


_
The visions of full figures casually perceived by sensitives and mediums be=
long to one or another=20

of the only three categories they can see: (_a_) Astrals of living men; (_b=
_) Nirmanakayas=20

(Adepts, good or bad, whose bodies are dead, but who have learned to live i=
n the invisible space=20

in their ethereal personalities); and (_c_) Spooks, Elementaries and Elemen=
tals masquerading in=20

shapes borrowed from the Astral Light in general, or from figures in the "m=
ind's eye" of the=20

audience, or of the medium, which are immediately reflected in their respec=
tive Auras.  Having=20

read the foregoing, students will now better comprehend the necessity of fi=
rst studying the=20

correspondences between our "principles"--which are but the various aspects=
 of the triune=20

(spiritual and physical) man--and our Paradigm, the direct roots of these i=
n the Universe. In view of=20

this, we to its point. But this last and dreaded resource served only to ex=
asperate the multitude.=20

From time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed amo=
ng the crowd;=20

projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were hea=
rd, the echo of=20

which, though they were probably fired in the air, made all hearts vibrate.=
 Voices, unheard except=20

on days of revolution, were distinguished; faces were seen that only appear=
ed on days of=20

bloodshed. Cries of "Death! death to the guards! to the Seine with the offi=
cer!" were heard above=20

all the noise, deafening as it was. Raoul, his hat in ribbons, his face ble=
eding, felt not only his=20

strength but also his reason going; a red mist covered his sight, and throu=
gh this mist he saw a=20

hundred threatening arms stretched over him, ready to seize upon him when h=
e fell. The guards=20

were unable to=20
