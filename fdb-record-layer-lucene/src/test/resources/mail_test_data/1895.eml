If only the departure, the sudden departure, of Skinner would be as conspic=
uously recorded as his=20

advent had been, what a relief it would be.  Nothing further appeared in th=
e papers about Skinner,=20

however, and Jackson was flattering himself that that gentleman had folded =
his tent like the Arab.=20

A great calm prevailed in the heart of Jackson.  But this proved to be only=
 a weather-breeder.=20

Sunday morning when Jackson entered the breakfast room, he found his wife i=
n police, a plain,=20

grave man, with regret in his face. "It's my duty to take Mr Erskine before=
 the sheriff. The result of=20

the examination will be, let us hope, that he'll come cannily home again, w=
hen all has been=20

inquired into in due form. There is no reason to take a gloomy view. The sh=
eriff will maybe find=20

there's no case: and I'm sure I wish so with all my heart."  They all sat r=
ound with the utmost=20

gravity to listen to this little speech. It was not a moment for=20


_
the great headline.  "What's the matter?  Some accident?  Somebody dead?"  =
"I should say not!=20

Somebody's very much alive!  We're the dead ones!"  Jackson took the paper =
from her hand and=20

read: "Important Social Event. The West dines the East.  Mr. and Mrs. J. Ma=
tthews Wilkinson=20

entertain at a quiet, select dinner Mr. and Mrs. William Manning Skinner, o=
f New York.  The dinner=20

guests were Mr. and Mrs. Philip Armitage, Mr. and Mrs. Almeric Baird, Mr. a=
nd Mrs. Jack Wendell-

-"  Jackson put the paper down.  Somehow he felt guilty.  He avoided his wi=
fe's reproachful eyes.=20

But he did n't dare cover up his ears, and the ear is not always so success=
ful at avoiding as the=20

eye.  The eye can see only straight ahead, but the ear can hear from all ar=
ound.  "Think of it,"=20

sniffled Mrs. Jackson, her sniffle developing into a blubber as she went on=
.  "I'm not a snob, but=20

why can't _I_ go with those people?  We've got lots of money!  I want to se=
e the best kind of life,=20

but I've never had the chance, and now these Skinners come here, are taken =
up,--wined and=20

dined,--and we're left out in the cold!"  table and the door, in perfect se=
lf-command, yet very pale.=20

Notwithstanding all the respect shown to him, and the good feeling from whi=
ch he had everything=20

to hope, the most innocent of men may be excused a feeling of dismay when h=
e is, to all intents=20

and purposes, arrested on a criminal charge, with issues to his good fame a=
nd social estimation,=20

even if nothing more, which it is impossible to calculate. They sat in sile=
nce while the dogcart was=20

getting ready, a strange little company. After a while, the officer, to les=
sen the embarrassment of=20

the moment, and make everything pleasant, began to address various little r=
emarks about the=20

weather and other commonplace topics to the two gentlemen, such as, "This i=
s a very agreeable=20

change from all the wet we've been having;" or, "The news this morning is m=
ore satisfactory about=20

that Afghan business." The responses made, as may be supposed, were not ver=
y effusive. It was=20

a relief when the dogcart came to the door. Old Rolls stood and watched it =
go down the avenue,=20

with his countenance firmly set, and a stern resolution gathering about his=
 mouth. Bauby=20
