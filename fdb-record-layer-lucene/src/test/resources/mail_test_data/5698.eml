therefore, of the lighter elements, they can more readily soar away into th=
e air. Fish, with their=20

aquatic nature, being moderately supplied with heat and made up in great pa=
rt of air and the=20

earthy, with as little of moisture as possible, can more easily exist in mo=
isture for the very reason=20

that they have less of it than of the other elements in their bodies; and s=
o, when they are drawn to=20

land, they leave life and water at the same moment. Similarly, the land ani=
mals, being moderately=20

supplied with the elements of air and heat, and having less of the earthy a=
nd a great deal of=20

moisture, cannot long continue alive in the water, because their portion of=
 moisture is already=20

abundant.  8. Therefore, if all this is as we have explained, our reason sh=
owing us that the bodies=20

of animals are made up of the elements, and these bodies, as we believe, gi=
ving way and=20

breaking up as a result of excess or deficiency in this or that element, we=
 cannot but believe that=20

we must take great care to select a very temperate climate for the site of =
our city, since=20

healthfulness is, as we have said, the first requisite.  9. I cannot too st=
rongly insist upon the need=20

of a return to the method of old times. Our ancestors, when about to build =
a town or an army post,=20

sacrificed some of the cattle that were wont to feed on the site proposed a=
nd examined their livers.=20

If the livers of the first victims were dark-coloured or abnormal, they sac=
rificed others, to see=20

whether the fault was due to disease or their food. They never began to bui=
ld defensive works in a=20

place until after they had made many such trials and satisfied themselves t=
hat good water and=20

food had made the liver sound and firm. If they continued to find it abnorm=
al, they argued from this=20

that the food and water outbursts from time to time, which called for the u=
tmost watchfulness and=20

promptitude on the part of the Brigade.  During one of these a block of pri=
vate dwellings nearest to=20

the conflagration was set on fire.  So intent was every one on the _great_ =
fire that this incidental=20

one was not observed until it had gained considerable headway.  The buildin=
gs were very old and=20

dry, so that, before an engine could be detached from the warehouses, it wa=
s in a complete blaze.=20

Most of the inhabitants escaped by the chief staircase before it became imp=
assable, and one or=20

two leaped from the lower windows.  It chanced that Joe Dashwood's engine w=
as nearest to this=20

house at the time, and was run up to it.  "Now then, lads, look alive," sai=
d Joe, as the men affixed=20

the hose and suction-pipe.  "Out o' the way!" cried Ned Crashington to two =
boys who appeared to=20

be rather curious about the operations of the firemen.  "I say," exclaimed =
the Bloater in great=20

excitement, "why--that's the 'ouse w'ere _Martha_ lives!"  "Who's Martha?" =
asked Ned, without=20

interrupting his operation of screwing on an additional length of hose.  "W=
'y, the friend o' Joe=20

Dashwood's wife--Martha--Martha Reading, you know."  "Eh!" exclaimed Ned, l=
ooking up.  At that=20

moment Martha herself appeared at a window in the upper storey, waving her =
arms and shrieking=20

wildly for help.  Men were seen endeavouring to bring forward a fire-escape=
, but the crowd was so=20

dense as to render this an unusually difficult and slow operation.  Without=
 uttering a word, Ned=20

Crashington dashed up the blazing staircase.  For a moment he was lost to v=
iew, but quickly=20

reappeared, attempting to cross a half-charred beam which overhung a yawnin=
g gulf of fire where=20

the first and second floors had just fallen in.  Suddenly a dense=20


_
as unhealthy for man, and so they moved away and changed to another neighbo=
urhood,=20

healthfulness being their chief object.  10. That pasturage and food may in=
dicate the healthful=20

qualities of a site is a fact which can be observed and investigated in the=
 case of certain pastures=20

in Crete, on each side of the river Pothereus, which separates the two Cret=
an states of Gnosus=20

and Gortyna. There are cattle at pasture on the right and left banks of tha=
t river, but while the=20

cattle that feed near Gnosus have the usual spleen, those on the other side=
 near Gortyna have no=20

perceptible spleen. On investigating the subject, physicians discovered on =
this side a kind of herb=20

which the cattle chew and thus make their spleen small. The herb is therefo=
re gathered and used=20

as a medicine for the cure of splenetic people. The Cretans call it [Greek:=
 hasplenon]. From food=20

and water, then, we may learn whether sites are naturally unhealthy or heal=
thy.  11. If the walled=20

town is built among the marshes themselves, provided they are by the sea, w=
ith a and was seen to=20

fall headlong into the flames.  A deep groan, or cry of horror, arose from =
the crowd, and wild=20

shouts of "fetch a ladder," "bring up the escape," were heard, while poor M=
artha got out on the=20

window-sill to avoid the flames, which were rapidly drawing towards and alm=
ost scorching her.=20

Just then a man was seen to dash furiously through the crowd, he fought his=
 way madly--knocking=20

down all who opposed him.  Gaining the door of the burning house he sprang =
in.  "I say,"=20

whispered Little Jim, in an excited voice, "it's Phil Sparks!"  "I'm glad t=
o hear it," observed a quiet,=20

broad-shouldered man, who stood near two policemen, to whom he winked knowi=
ngly.  The=20

Bloater attempted to move off, but one of the policemen detained him.  The =
other detained Little=20

Jim.  Meanwhile the crowd looked for Phil's reappearance on the beam from w=
hich poor Ned=20

Crashington had fallen, but Phil knew the house better than Ned.  He gained=
 the upper floor by a=20

back stair, which was not quite impassable; seized Martha in his arms, just=
 as she was=20


_
above the level of the seashore, the site will be reasonable enough. For di=
tches can be dug to let=20

out the water to the shore, and also in times of storms the sea swells and =
comes backing up into=20

the marshes, where its bitter blend prevents the reproductions of the usual=
 marsh creatures, while=20

any that swim down from the higher levels to the shore are killed at once b=
y the saltness to which=20

they are unused. An instance of this may be found in the Gallic marshes sur=
rounding Altino,=20

Ravenna, Aquileia, and other towns in places of the kind, close by marshes.=
 They are marvellously=20

healthy, for the reasons which I have given.  12. But marshes that are stag=
nant and have no=20

outlets either by rivers or ditches, like the Pomptine marshes, merely putr=
efy as they stand,=20

emitting heavy, unhealthy vapours. A case of a town built in such a spot wa=
s Old Salpia in Apulia,=20

founded by Diomede on his way back from Troy, or, according to some writers=
, by Elpias of=20

Rhodes. Year after year there was sickness, until finally the suffering inh=
abitants came with a=20

public petition to Marcus Hostilius and got him to agree to seek and find t=
hem a proper leap into=20

the street, and dragged her back into the smoke and flames. It appeared alm=
ost certain that both=20

must have perished; but in a few seconds the man was seen to descend the lo=
wer stair with the=20

woman in his arms, and in another moment a wild enthusiastic cheer burst fr=
om the vast multitude=20

as he leaped into the street.  Laying Martha gently down on a doorstep, Spa=
rks bent over her, and=20

whispered in her ear.  She appeared to have swooned, but opened her eyes, a=
nd gazed earnestly=20

in the face of her deliverer.  "The Lord must have sent you to save me, Phi=
l; He will save _you_=20

also, if you will trust Him."  "Forgive me, Martha, I was hard on you, but-=
-"  "God bless you, Phil--"=20

"Clear the way there," cried a commanding voice; "here, doctor, this way." =
 The crowd opened.  A=20

medical man came forward and examined Martha, and pronounced her to be only=
 slightly injured.=20

Several men then raised her and carried her towards a neighbouring house.  =
Phil Sparks was=20

about to follow, but the quiet man with the broad shoulders touched him gen=
tly on the arm, and=20

said that he was "wanted."  "Sorry to interrupt you in such a good work,=20
