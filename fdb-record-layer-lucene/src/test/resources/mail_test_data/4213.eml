_Frontispiece_  _From a intended diversion from New York, delayed for some =
time to await the=20

arrival of forces from Europe, had at length been successfully made, and th=
at all the American=20

posts in the Highlands had fallen into the hands of the British. Should Bur=
goyne continue to hold=20

out, this new enemy might even make a push on Albany.  The main defences of=
 the Highlands,=20

Forts Clinton and Montgomery, on the west bank of the Hudson, separated fro=
m each other by a=20

small stream, and too high to be battered from the water, were surrounded b=
y steep and rugged=20

hills which made the approach to them on the land side very difficult. To s=
top the ascent of the=20

enemy=E2=80=99s ships, frames of timber, with projecting beams shod with ir=
on, had been sunk in the=20

channel. A boom, formed of great trees fastened together, extended from ban=
k to bank, and in=20

front of this boom was stretched a huge iron chain. Above these impediments=
 several armed=20

vessels were moored. On an island a few miles higher up, and near the easte=
rn bank of the river,=20

was Fort Constitution, with another boom and chain. Near the entrance of th=
e Highlands, and=20

below the other posts, Fort Independence occupied a high point of land on t=
he east bank of the=20

river. It was at Peekskill, just below Fort Independence, that the commandi=
ng officer in the=20

Highlands usually had his headquarters. The two brigades sent to the Northe=
rn army, and other=20

detachments which Washington had himself been obliged to draw from the High=
lands, had so=20

weakened the regular garrison that Washington became much alarmed for the s=
afety of that=20

important post. The remainder of the New York militia, not under arms in th=
e Northern Department,=20

had been called out by Governor Clinton to supply the place of the detached=
 regulars; other militia=20

had been sent from Connecticut; but, as no signs of immediate attack appear=
ed, and as the=20

harvest demanded their services at home, Putnam allowed most of them to ret=
urn. Half the New=20

York militia were ordered back again by Clinton, but before they had muster=
ed the posts were lost.=20

Putnam was at Peekskill with the main body of the garrison, which amounted =
in the whole to not=20



more than two thousand men. While a party of the enemy amused him with the =
idea that Fort=20

Independence was their object, a stronger party landed lower down, on the o=
ther side of the river,=20

and, pushing inland through the defiles of the Highlands, approached Forts =
Clinton and=20

Montgomery, of which the entire garrison did not exceed six hundred men. Be=
fore assistance=20

could be sent by Putnam--indeed, before he knew of the attack--the forts, m=
uch too extensive to=20

be defended by so small a force, were both taken on October 5th. Governor C=
linton, who=20

commanded, his brother, General James Clinton, and a part of the garrison a=
vailed themselves of=20

the knowledge of the ground and escaped across the river, but the Americans=
 suffered a loss of=20

two hundred and fifty in killed and prisoners. Fort Constitution was immedi=
ately evacuated by the=20

few troops that held it, and two new Continental frigates, with some other =
vessels, were set on fire=20

to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy. Even Peekskill and Fo=
rt Independence were=20

abandoned, the stores being conveyed to Fishkill, whither Putnam retired wi=
th his forces. The=20

booms and chains were removed, so that ships could pass up; and a British d=
etachment under=20

Tryon burned Continental Village, a new settlement on the east side of the =
river, where many=20

public stores were deposited.  [Illustration: DISPOSITION OF TROOPS FROM OC=
TOBER 11TH=20

TILL THE SURRENDER, OCTOBER 17TH]  Informed of these movements, and very an=
xious to=20

have Burgoyne=E2=80=99s army out of the way, Gates agreed, on October 16th,=
 that the British troops=20

should march out of their camp with the honors of war, should lay down thei=
r arms, and be=20

conducted to Boston, there to embark for England, under an engagement not t=
o serve against the=20

United States till exchanged. Having heard from a deserter of the advance o=
f Clinton, Burgoyne=20

hesitated to ratify the treaty; but, on consideration and consultation with=
 his officers, he did not=20

choose to run the risk of breaking it. The prisoners included in this capit=
ulation were five thousand=20

six hundred and forty-two; the previous losses of the army amounted to near=
 four thousand more.=20

The arms, artillery, baggage, and camp equipage became the property of the =
captors. The=20

German regiments contrived to save their colors by cutting them from the st=
aves, rolling them up,=20

and packing them away with Madame de Riedesel=E2=80=99s baggage.  As soon a=
s the garrison of=20

Ticonderoga heard of the surrender, they hastily destroyed what they could =
and retired to Canada.=20

Putnam no sooner heard of it than he sent pressing despatches for assistanc=
e. The British had=20

proceeded as high up as Esopus, which they burned about the very time that =
Burgoyne was=20

capitulating. Putnam had been already joined by some three thousand militia=
, to which a large=20

detachment from Gates=E2=80=99 army was soon added. As it was now too late =
to succor Burgoyne, having=20

dismantled the forts in the Highlands, the British returned to New York, ca=
rrying with them sixty-

seven pieces of heavy artillery and a large quantity of provisions and ammu=
nition. Before their=20

departure they burned every house within their reach--a piece of malice asc=
ribed to Tryon and his=20

Tories.  The capture of a whole British army,[91] lately the object of so m=
uch terror, produced,=20

especially in New England, an exultation proportionate to the recent alarm.=
 The military reputation=20

of Gates, elevated to a very high pitch, rivalled even the fame of Washingt=
on, dimmed as it was by=20

the loss of Philadelphia, which, meanwhile, had fallen into the enemy=E2=80=
=99s hands. The youthful=20

Wilkinson, who had acted during the campaign as deputy adjutant-general of =
the American army,=20

and whose _Memoirs_ contain the best account of its movements, being sent t=
o Congress with=20

news of the surrender, was henceforth honored with a brevet commission as b=
rigadier-general;=20

which, however, he speedily resigned when he found a remonstrance against t=
his irregular=20



advancement sent to Congress by forty-seven colonels of the line. The inves=
tigation into=20

Schuyler=E2=80=99s conduct resulted, a year afterward, in his acquittal wit=
h the highest honor. He insisted,=20

however, on resigning his commission, though strongly urged by Congress to =
retain it. But he did=20

not relinquish the service of his country, in which he continued as active =
as ever, being presently=20

chosen a member of Congress.   SYNOPSIS OF THE PRINCIPAL EVENTS, CHIEFLY=20

CORNWALLIS (1781)     The year 1781 opened with small promise of a speedy e=
nding of the=20

American struggle for independence. New York remained in the hands   of the=
 English. Cornwallis=20

was confident of success in the South.   But Greene=E2=80=99s brilliant cam=
paigning and Lafayette=E2=80=99s=20

strategy left   Cornwallis with a wearied army devoid of any fruits of vict=
ory,   and, finally returning=20

to the seaboard, he settled himself at   Yorktown. Washington, before New Y=
ork, had watched the=20

Southern   campaigns closely. Word came from the Count de Grasse that the  =
 French fleet under=20

his command was ready to leave the West Indies   and join in operations in =
Virginia. Washington=20

at once planned a   new campaign, destined to prove of peculiar brilliancy.=
 He was   joined by=20

Rochambeau=E2=80=99s French army from Newport. Clinton, the   British comma=
nder in New York, was=20

tricked into believing that   the city was to be closely besieged. But the =
American and French=20

armies, six thousand strong, passed by New York in a race through   Princet=
on and Philadelphia to=20

Chesapeake Bay, which they reached   on September 5th, the day that De Gras=
se entered with=20

his fleet to   join the other French fleet which had been set free from New=
port.   De Grasse=20

maintained his command of Chesapeake Bay in spite of the   futile attack of=
 Admiral Graves and=20

the British fleet. If Rodney,   who had sailed for England, had been in Gra=
ves=E2=80=99 place the outcome=20

might have been different. A defeat of De Grasse would have meant   British=
 control of the water=20

and a support for Cornwallis, which   would have saved his army and ruined =
Washington=E2=80=99s plans.=20

BARYE   At the Metropolitan Museum of Art are two pictures by the Florentin=
e painter of the=20

fifteenth century called Piero di Cosimo. They represent hunting scenes, an=
d the figures are those=20

of men, women, fauns, satyrs, centaurs, and beasts of the forests, fiercely=
 struggling together. As=20

we observe the lion fastening his teeth in the flesh of the boar, the bear =
grappling with his human=20

slayer, and the energy and determination of the creatures at bay, our thoug=
ht involuntarily bridges=20

a chasm of four centuries and calls up the image of the Barye bronzes in wh=
ich are displayed the=20

same detachment of vision, the same absence of sentimentality, the same vig=
or and intensity if not=20

quite the same strangeness of imagination. It is manifestly unwise to carry=
 the parallel very far, yet=20

there is still another touch of similarity in the beautiful surfaces. Piero=
's fine, delicate handling of=20

pigment is in the same manner of expression as Barye's exquisite manipulati=
on of his metal after=20

the casting, his beautiful thin patines that do not suppress but reveal sen=
sitive line and subtle=20

modulation. We know little enough of Piero beyond what his canvases tell us=
. Of Barye we=20



naturally know more, although everything save what his work confides of his=
 character and=20

temperament is of secondary importance, and he is interesting to moderns, e=
specially as the=20

father of modern   I  The allied American and French armies joined Lafayett=
e at Williamsburg,=20

Virginia, September 25, 1781, and on the 27th there was a besieging army th=
ere of sixteen=20

thousand men, under the chief command of Washington, assisted by Rochambeau=
. The British=20

force, about half as numerous, were mostly behind intrenchments at Yorktown=
. On the arrival of=20

Washington and Rochambeau at Williamsburg, they proceeded to the _Ville de =
Paris_, De=20

Grasse=E2=80=99s flag-ship, to congratulate the admiral on his victory over=
 the British admiral Graves on the=20

5th, which had prevented British relief of Yorktown by sea, and to make spe=
cific arrangements for=20

the future. Preparations for the siege were immediately begun. The allied a=
rmies marched from=20

Williamsburg (September 28th), driving in the British outposts as they appr=
oached Yorktown, and=20

taking possession of abandoned works. The allies formed a semicircular line=
 about two miles from=20

the British intrenchments, each wing resting on the York River, and on the =
30th the place was=20

completely invested. The British at Gloucester, opposite, were imprisoned b=
y French dragoons=20

under the Duke de Lauzun, Virginia militia, led by General Weedon, and eigh=
t hundred French=20

marines. Only once did the imprisoned troops attempt to escape from that po=
int. Tarleton=E2=80=99s legion=20

sallied out, but were soon driven back by De Lauzun=E2=80=99s cavalry, who =
made Tarleton=E2=80=99s horse a=20

prisoner and came near capturing his owner.  [Illustration: SIEGE OF YORKTO=
WN]  In the=20

besieging lines before Yorktown the French troops occupied the left, the We=
st India troops of St.=20

Simon being on the extreme flank. The Americans were on the right; and the =
French artillery, with=20

the quarters of the two commanders, occupied the centre. The American artil=
lery, commanded by=20

General Knox, was with the right. The fleet of De Grasse was in Lynn Haven =
Bay to beat off any=20

vessels that might attempt to relieve Cornwallis. On the night of October 6=
th heavy ordnance was=20

brought up from the French ships, and trenches were begun at six hundred ya=
rds from the British=20

works. The first parallel was completed before the morning of the 7th, unde=
r the direction of=20

General Lincoln; and on the afternoon of the 9th several batteries and redo=
ubts were finished, and=20

a general discharge of heavy guns was opened by the Americans on the right.=
 Early on the=20

morning of the 10th the French opened several batteries on the left. That e=
vening the same troops=20

hurled red-hot balls upon British vessels in the river, which caused the de=
struction by fire of=20

several of them--one a forty-four-gun ship.  The allies began the second pa=
rallel on the night of the=20

11th, which the British did not discover until daylight came, when they bro=
ught several heavy guns=20

to bear upon the diggers. On the 14th it was determined to storm two of the=
 redoubts which were=20

most annoying, as they commanded the trenches. One on the right, near the Y=
ork River, was=20

garrisoned by forty-five men; the other, on the left, was manned by about o=
ne hundred and twenty=20

men. The capture of the former was intrusted to Americans led by Lieutenant=
-Colonel Alexander=20

Hamilton, and that of the latter to French grenadiers led by Count Deuxpont=
s. At a given signal=20

Hamilton advanced in two columns--one led by Major Fish, the other by Lieut=
enant-Colonel Gimat,=20

Lafayette=E2=80=99s aide, while Lieutenant-Colonel John Laurens, with eight=
y men, proceeded to turn the=20

redoubt to intercept a retreat of the garrison. So agile and furious was th=
e assault that the redoubt=20

was carried in a few minutes, with little loss on either side. Laurens was =
among the first to enter=20

the redoubt and make the commander, Major Campbell, a prisoner. The life of=
 every man who=20

ceased to resist was spared.  Meanwhile the French, after a severe struggle=
, in which they lost=20



about one hundred men in killed and wounded, captured the other redoubt. Wa=
shington, with Knox=20

and some others, had watched the movements with intense anxiety, and when t=
he commander-in-

chief saw both redoubts in possession of his troops he turned and said to K=
nox, =E2=80=9CThe work is=20

done, and well done.=E2=80=9D That night both redoubts were included in the=
 second parallel. The situation=20

of Cornwallis was now critical. He was surrounded by a superior force, his =
works were crumbling,=20

and he saw that when the second parallel of the besiegers should be complet=
ed and the cannon=20

on their batteries mounted his post at Yorktown would become untenable, and=
 he resolved to=20

attempt an escape by abandoning the place, his baggage, and his sick, cross=
 the York River,=20

disperse the allies who environed Gloucester, and by rapid marches gain the=
 forks of the=20

PORTRAIT OF ANTOINE LOUIS BARYE  _From a painting by J. F. Millet_]  Antoin=
e Louis Barye,=20

born at Paris September 15, 1796, died June 25, 1875, in the same year with=
 Corot and at the=20

same age. The circumstances under which he began his career have been told =
in detail by more=20

than one biographer, but it would be difficult rightly to estimate the impo=
rtance and singularity of=20

his work without some review of them. His father was a jeweler of Lyons, wh=
o settled in Paris=20

before Antoine was born, and whose idea of education for his son was to pla=
ce him at less than=20

fourteen with an engraver of military equipments from whom he learned to en=
grave on steel and=20

other metals, and later with a jeweler from whom he learned to make steel m=
atrixes for molding=20

reliefs from thin metals. A certain stress has been laid on this lack of sc=
hooling in the conventional=20

sense of the word, but it is difficult to see that it did much harm, since =
Barye, though he was not a=20

correct writer of French, was a great reader, keenly intelligent in his ana=
lysis of the knowledge he=20

gained from books, and with extraordinary power of turning it to his own us=
es. Such a mind does=20

not seriously miss the advantages offered by a formal training, and it migh=
t fairly be argued that=20

the manual skill developed at the work-bench was in the long run more valua=
ble to him than the=20

abstract knowledge which he might have acquired in school could possibly ha=
ve been. Be that as=20

it may, up to the time of his marriage in 1823 he had a varied apprenticesh=
ip. At sixteen he was=20

drawn as a conscript and was first assigned to the department where maps in=
 relief are modeled.=20

Before he was twenty-one he was working with a sculptor called Bosio, and a=
lso in the studio of=20

the painter, Baron Gros. He studied Lamarck, Cuvier and Buffon. He competed=
 five times for the=20

_Prix de Rome_ at the Salon, once in the section of medals and four times i=
n the section of=20

sculpture, succeeding once (in the first competition) in gaining a second p=
rize. He then went back=20

to the jeweler's bench for eight years, varying the monotony of his work by=
 modeling=20

independently small reliefs of _Eagle and Serpent_, _Eagle and Antelope_, _=
Leopard_,=20

_Panther_, and other animals.  In 1831 he sent to the Salon of that year th=
e _Tiger Devouring a=20

Gavial of the Ganges_, a beautiful little bronze, seven and a half inches h=
igh, which won a Second=20

Medal and was bought by the Government for the Luxembourg. This was the beg=
inning of his true=20

career. In the same Salon was exhibited his _Martyrdom of St. Sebastian_, b=
ut the powerful=20

realism and energy of the animal group represented what henceforth was to b=
e Barye's=20

characteristic achievement, the realization, that is, of what the Chinese c=
all the "movement of life;"=20

the strange reality of appearance that is never produced by imitation of na=
ture and that makes the=20

greatness of art. The tiger clutches its victim with great gaunt paws, its =
eyes are fixed upon the=20

prey, its body is drawn together with tense muscles, its tail is curled, th=
e serpent is coiled about=20

the massive neck of its destroyer with large undulating curves. The touch i=
s everywhere certain,=20

the composition is dignified, and the group as an exhibition of extraordina=
ry knowledge is=20

noteworthy.  A lithograph portrait of Barye by Gigoux, made at about this t=
ime, shows a fine head,=20

interested eyes, a firm mouth and a determined chin. His chief qualities we=
re perseverance,=20

scientific curiosity, modesty and pride, and that indomitable desire for pe=
rfection so rarely=20

encountered and so precious an element in the artist's equipment. He was li=
ttle of a talker, little of=20

a writer, infinitely studious, somewhat reserved and cold in manner, yet fo=
nd of good company and=20

not averse to good dinners. Guillaume said of him that he had the genius of=
 great science and of=20

high morality, which is the best possible definition in  Boats for the pass=
age of the river were=20



prepared and a part of the troops passed over, when a furious storm suddenl=
y arose and made=20

any further attempts to cross too hazardous to be undertaken. The troops we=
re brought back, and=20

Cornwallis lost hope. After that the bombardment of his lines was continuou=
s, severe, and=20

destructive, and on the 17th he offered to make terms for surrender. On the=
 following day=20

Lieutenant-Colonel de Laurens and Viscount de Noailles (a kinsman of Madame=
 Lafayette), as=20

commissioners of the allies, met Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas and Major Ross, =
of the British army,=20

at the house of the Widow Moore to arrange terms for capitulation. They wer=
e made similar to=20

those demanded of Lincoln at Charleston eighteen months before. The capitul=
ation was duly=20

signed, October 19, 1781, and late on the afternoon of the same day Cornwal=
lis, his army, and=20

public property were surrendered to the allies.[92]  For the siege of Yorkt=
own the French provided=20

thirty-seven ships of the line, and the Americans nine. The Americans furni=
shed nine thousand=20

land troops (of whom fifty-five hundred were regulars), and the French seve=
n thousand. Among=20

the prisoners were two battalions of Anspachers, amounting to ten hundred a=
nd twenty-seven=20

men, and two regiments of Hessians, numbering eight hundred and seventy-fiv=
e. The flag of the=20

Anspachers was given to Washington by the Congress.  The news of the surren=
der of Cornwallis=20

at Yorktown spread great joy throughout the colonies, especially at Philade=
lphia, the seat of the=20

national government. Washington sent Lieutenant-Colonel Tilghman to Congres=
s with the news.=20

He rode express to Philadelphia to carry the despatches of the chief announ=
cing the joyful event.=20

He entered the city at midnight, October 23d, and knocked so violently at t=
he door of Thomas=20

McKean, the president of Congress, that a watchman was disposed to arrest h=
im. Soon the glad=20

tidings spread over the city. The watchman, proclaiming the hour and giving=
 the usual cry, =E2=80=9CAll=E2=80=99s=20

well,=E2=80=9D added, =E2=80=9Cand Cornwallis is taken!=E2=80=9D Thousands =
of citizens rushed from their beds, half=20

dressed, and filled the streets. The old State-house bell, that had clearly=
 proclaimed=20

independence, now rang out tones of gladness. Lights were seen moving in ev=
ery house. The first=20

blush of morning was greeted with the booming of cannon, and at an early ho=
ur the Congress=20

assembled and with quick-beating hearts heard Charles Thomson read the desp=
atch from=20

Washington. At its conclusion it was resolved to go in a body to the Luther=
an church, at 2 P.M.,=20

and =E2=80=9Creturn thanks to the Almighty God for crowning the allied armi=
es of the United States and=20

France with success.=E2=80=9D[93]   II  THE RESULTS OF YORKTOWN  _By Claude=
 Halstead Van Tyne,=20

Ph.D._  The surrender of Cornwallis came at the right time to produce a gre=
at political effect in=20

England. The war had assumed such tremendous proportions that accumulated d=
isaster seemed=20

to threaten the ruin of Great Britain. From India came news of Hyder Ali=E2=
=80=99s temporary successes,=20

and of the presence of a strong French armament which demanded that England=
 yield every claim=20

except to Bengal. That Warren Hastings and Sir Eyre Coote would yet save th=
e British Empire=20

there, the politicians could not foresee. Spain had already driven the Brit=
ish forces from Florida,=20

and in the spring of 1782 Minorca fell before her repeated assaults and Gib=
raltar was fearfully=20

beset. De Grasse=E2=80=99s successes during the winter in the West Indies l=
eft only Jamaica, Barbadoes,=20

and Antigua in British hands. St. Eustatius, too, was recaptured, and it wa=
s not until the middle of=20

April that Rodney regained England=E2=80=99s naval supremacy by a famous vi=
ctory near Marie-

Galante.[94] England had not a friend in Europe, and was beset at home by v=
iolent agitation in=20

Ireland, to which she was obliged to yield an independent Irish Parliament.=
[95] Rodney=E2=80=99s victory=20

and the successful repulsion of the Spaniards from Gibraltar, in the summer=
 of 1782, came too=20



late to save=20


_
of his artistic faculty. He had the kind of sensitiveness, or self-esteem, =
if you will, that frequently=20

goes with a mind confident of its merits, but not indifferent to criticism =
or sufficiently elevated and=20

aloof to dispense with resentment. In 1832 he sent to the Salon his _Lion C=
rushing a Serpent_,=20

and in 1833 he sent a dozen animal sculptures, a group of medallions and si=
x water-colors. That=20

year he was made chevalier of the Legion of Honour, but the following year =
nine groups made for=20

the Duke of Orleans were rejected by the Salon jury, and again in 1836 seve=
ral small pieces were=20

rejected, although the _Seated Lion_, later bought by the government, was a=
ccepted. The reasons=20

for the the North ministry.  The negotiations between the English and Ameri=
can peace envoys=20

dragged on. Congress had instructed the commissioners not to make terms wit=
hout the approval=20

of the French court, but the commissioners became suspicious of Vergennes, =
broke their=20

instructions, and dealt directly and solely with the British envoys. Bounda=
ries, fishery questions,=20

treatment of the American loyalists, and settlement of American debts to Br=
itish subjects were=20

settled one after another, and, November 30, 1782, a provisional treaty was=
 signed. The definitive=20

treaty was delayed until September 3, 1783, after France and England had ag=
reed upon terms of=20

peace.[96]  America awaited the outcome=20
