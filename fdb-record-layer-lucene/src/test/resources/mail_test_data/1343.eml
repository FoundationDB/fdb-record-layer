philodendron monstera by faith; the psalm which begins with a plaintive cry, ends in praise for deliverance, as if it had been already achieved--    "Thou hast delivered my life from death,    (Hast Thou) not (delivered) my feet from falling,    That I may walk before God in the light of the philodendron monstera by faith; the psalm which begins with a plaintive cry, ends in praise for deliverance, as if it had been already achieved--    "Thou hast delivered my life from death,    (Hast Thou) not (delivered) my feet from falling,    That I may walk before God in the light of the _
with God, the power of it as grappling with his dread, and enabling him now to say, "I do _not_ 

fear."  But again he falls from this height; another surge of fear breaks over him, and almost 

washes him from his rock. His foes, with ceaseless malice, arrest his words; they skulk in ambush, 

they dog his heels, they long for his life. The crowded clauses portray the extremity of the peril and 

the singer's agitation. His soul is still heaving with the ground swell of the storm, though the blasts 

come more fitfully, and are dying into calm. He is not so afraid but that he can turn to God; he 

turns to Him because he is afraid, like the disciples in later days, who had so much of terror that 

they must awake their Master, but so much of trust that His awaking was enough. He pleads with 

God, as in former psalms, against his enemies, in words which go far beyond the occasion, and 

connect his own deliverance with the judgments of God over the whole earth. He plaintively recalls 

his homelessness and his desire, and then they go on whispering and tittering to each other, till 

Joseph says in a very loud tone--Ahem!  On which a general silence. It seems as impossible and 

incongruous for me to write here what now takes place, as it did at the time to take part in it. It 

requires no stretch of imagination on the part of my readers to divine what movement it was which 

caused the next general rustle. Remember that a great proportion of these young ladies were 

brought here by their mammas, and in their secret souls would have rather been at a ball; but their 

mammas disapproved of balls, and made them do this instead. Now, tell me, which was most 

wrong? I knew of one young lady, at least, whose object in coming was not to do what she was 

then doing. How many young men would have been there had there been no young ladies? and 

what were they all thinking about now? And as I looked at the subscription-vase, and listened to 

the monotonous voice of a "dear Christian friend" behind it, who had been called

which exhibit the characteristic blending of hope and pain, and which are beautifully in accordance 

with the date assigned to the psalm. "My wanderings dost Thou, even Thou, number." He is not 

alone in these weary flights from Gibeah to Ramah, from Ramah to Nob, from Nob to Gath, from 

Gath he knows not whither. One friend goes with him through them all. And as the water-skin was 

a necessary part of a traveller's equipment, the mention of his wanderings suggests the bold and 

tender metaphor of the next clause, "Put my tears in Thy bottle,"--a prayer for that very 

remembrance of his sorrows, in the existence of which he immediately declares his confidence--

"Are they not in Thy book?" The true office of faithful communion with God is to ask for, and to 

appropriate, the blessings which in the very act become ours. He knows that his cry will scatter his 

foes, for God is for him. And thus once again he has risen to the height of confidence where for a 

moment his feet have been already planted, and again--but this time with even fuller emphasis, 

expressed by an proceedings, I thought, Can it be possible that these are those of whom it is said, 

"they devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer"? Can it be possible to put 

anything into that vase without the right hand knowing what the left hand is doing, and all the 

people seeing both hands? Is not "the trumpet" even now being "sounded" by "the hypocrites" that 

they may have "glory of men"? Is there, in fact, any difference, practically, between kneeling in 

Lady Broadhem's drawing-room, by way of an after-dinner entertainment, and loving "to pray 

standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that you may be seen of men"? Is 

there any part of a clergyman's dress called a phylactery; and if so, when he becomes a bishop, 

does the hem of it become broader? and if it was wrong for a priest in Jerusalem, eighteen 

hundred years ago, to be called "Rabbi, Rabbi," is it less wrong for one in London now to be called 

"My lord, My lord"?  I was thinking how much more usefully Bishop Colenso would have been 

employed in pointing out those anomalies in 


_
only time in the psalm the mighty covenant name--he breaks into his triumphant strain--    "In God 

I praise the Word;    In JEHOVAH I praise the Word:    In God I trust, I do not fear:--    What shall 

man do to me?"  And from this mood of trustful expectation he does not again decline. Prayer has 

brought its chiefest blessing--the peace that passeth understanding. The foe is religion, instead of 

the discrepancies in its records, and what a much stronger case the Zulu might have made out 

against Christians if he had known as much of the countries which they inhabit as I do, when the 

rustling again became general, and the monotonous voice ceased.  "Dear Christian friends," 

began Joseph--and here I may remark that this epithet is only applied by the
