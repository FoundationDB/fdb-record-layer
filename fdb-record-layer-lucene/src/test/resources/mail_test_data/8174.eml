man cares very much for=20

the old gentleman with an=20

indignant snort. "Of course, Pit Town's in the fashion," he continued, "for=

 being I see in my=20

 lean shall be=20

deliciously blended in the requisite proportions. I know I strive after the=
 unattainable, but still every=20

year I get nearer and nearer to the goal. When I remember, sir, what black =
pigs were when I was a=20

boy, and what they are now, thanks to my efforts and =E2=80=9Cand I am reso=
lved to grapple with it. It=20

seems to me that pauperism is not an affair so much of wages as of dwelling=
s. If the working-

classes were properly lodged, at their present rate of wages, they would be=
 richer. They would be=20

healthier and happier at the same cost. I am so convinced of this, that the=
 moment I am master, I=20

shall build two thousand cottages on any estates. I have the designs alread=

sterday, sir, when Dr.=20

Wolff pointed out to me what he called a specimen of George Morland's best =
manner, I felt what=20

giant strides of progress we have made. There were the pigs of _his_ day, r=
epresented as great=20

gaunt bony bristly creatures, wallowing at large, sir, in muck and mire. We=
 never see such horrors=20

now; and I actually envied Pit Town the possession of that picture. I shoul=
d like to hang it up, sir, in=20

my piggeries at The Priory, that the world might look upon what the animal =
was, and in contrasting=20

him with the superb creatures I possess, appreciate what can be done by car=
e, breeding, feeding,=20

and proper selection. The time will come, Reginald, when every English spea=
king man or woman=20

who puts a piece of pork or bacon into his mouth will bless the name of Hag=
gard. But these are=20
