philodendron monstera was separated from Syria during the Deluge, and after floating round about upon the water at length rested in its present situation, where its soil has continued to grant my prayer."  This conclusion of one of the fables in the book called _Ysopet_, which we have translated freely, shows us that Marie was of French birth, but philodendron monstera was separated from Syria during the Deluge, and after floating round about upon the water at length rested in its present situation, where its soil has continued to grant my prayer."  This conclusion of one of the fables in the book called _Ysopet_, which we have translated freely, shows us that Marie was of French birth, but _
between the times of Moses and Jesus; 5. That he lived between Jesus and Mohammad; and 6. 

That he was of the lineage of Yoonan, son [as some say] of Noah, in the days of Abraham; and 

this, adds the author, is the most correct.--But some suppose him to be the same with Alexander 

the Manichseism which asserted the existence of two Eternal powers, equipotent, the one a power 

of Good, the other a power of Evil. Since Evil ruled the world on equal terms with Good, might not 

man feel utterly relieved of moral responsibility? Certainly, such is the tendency of this species of 


_
most obvious signification of which is 'the two-horned,' the more judicious in general are of opinion 

that he received it because he made expeditions to the extreme parts of the east and west, and 

therefore that it signifies 'Lord of the two extreme parts of the earth.'  [209] Who were clothed in 

the skins of wild beasts, and lived upon what the sea cast on shore.--S. (B.)  [210] The Arabs call 

them Yajooj and Majooj, and say they are two nations or tribes descended from Japheth the son of 

Noah; or, as others write, Gog are a tribe of the Turks, and Magog of those of Geelan, the Geli 

and Gelae of Ptolemy and Strabo.--It is said these barbarous people made their irruptions into the 

neighbouring countries in the spring, and destroyed and carried off all the fruits of the earth; and 

some pretend they were man-eaters.--S. (B.)  [211] The Eastern authors unanimously agree that 

he (Azar) was a statuary, or carver of idols; and he is represented as the first who made images of 

clay, pictures only having been in use before, and  Whether the Albigensian heresy be responsible 

or not, it is unquestionable that the troubadours were in nearly all cases indifferent, and in very 

many cases sceptical or utterly rebellious, in their attitude toward the Church and its teachings. 

Among the nobility the sacrament of marriage, so carefully hedged about by the canons of the 

Church, could hardly have been regarded with much respect, since a venal clergy was ready to 

sanction a union which their own Church pronounced incestuous or to dissolve one which their 

own Church pronounced indissoluble. Political and racial antipathy, the old ineradicable and 

inexplicable hatred of north for south, helped on the religious quarrel. Count Raymond of 

Toulouse, who seems to have been merely an easy-going man, inclined rather to religious liberty 

and freedom of conscience than to positive heresy, was assailed as a monster of vice. At length, 

in 1208, Pope Innocent III. authorized the Cistercian monks to preach a crusade against the 

Albigenses: "Arise! ye soldiers of Christ! 


_
employment was a very honourable one, and that he was a great lord and in high favour with 

Nimrod, whose son-in-law he was, because he made his idols for him and was excellent in his art. 

Some of the Rabbins say Terah was a priest and chief of the order.--S.  [212] Some tell us that 

Nimrod, on seeing this miraculous deliverance from his palace, cried out that he would make an 

offering to the God of Abraham; and that he accordingly sacrificed four thousand kine. [B.] But, if 

he ever relented, he soon relapsed into his former infidelity: for he built a tower that he might 

ascend to heaven to see Abraham's God; which being overthrown [Kur. xvi. 28], still persisting in 

his design, he would be carried to heaven in a chest borne by four monstrous birds; but after 

wandering for some time through the air, he fell down on a mountain with such force that he made 

it shake, whereto (as some fancy) a passage in the Kur-an [xiv. 47] alludes, which may be 

translated, 'although their contrivances be such as to make the mountains tremble.'--Nimrod, 

disappointed in his design of making war with God, turned his arms against Abraham, reveal to 

you. Stretch forth your arms and smite the heretics, making upon them war more relentless than 

upon the Saracens." So ran the papal letters. The new crusade was preached far and wide over 

France, Germany, and Italy, and a host of crusaders, promised greater indulgences than those 

who went to the Holy Land, assembled to destroy Provence. Among their leaders were two 

recreant troubadours, Izarn, who leaves us his version of the fall of Provence, and Folquet, now 

Bishop of Toulouse, who is so cruel, so bitter, so treacherous in the cause of Christ that one 

enjoys hearing him called by the troubadour nickname "Bishop of Devils." More terrible than 

Folquet, because more sincere, was one Domingo, canon of Osma, a man of almost puritanic 

habits of mind, famous in history as the founder of the order of _Fratres Predicatores_, the 

Dominican Preaching Friars, and of an institution not less well known--the Inquisition. The military 

leader who really broke the back of the resistance in Provence was Simon de Montfort. The siege 

and capture of Beziers, where a number of those accused of heresy had taken refuge, will serve 


_
being a great prince, raised forces to defend himself; but God, dividing Nimrod's subjects, and 

confounding their language, deprived him of the greater part of his people, and plagued those who 

adhered to him by swarms of gnats, which destroyed almost all of them; and one of those gnats 

having entered into the nostril, or ear, of Nimrod, penetrated to one of the membranes of his brain, 

where, growing Beziers was taken the soldiers asked Abbot Arnold, of Citeaux, who represented 

the Church of Mercy: "How shall we distinguish the faithful from the heretics among the people of 

the town?" The priest answered: _Caedite eos, novit enim Dominus qui sunt ejus_: "Kill them all, 

for the Lord will know His own." In this spirit the Albigensian war continued, with occasional 

respites, for more than thirty years. 


_
every day, it gave him such intolerable pain, that he was obliged to cause his head to be beaten 

with a mallet, in order to procure some ease, which torture he suffered four hundred years; God 

being willing to punish, by one of the smallest of His creatures, him who insolently boasted himself 

to be lord of all. A Syrian calendar places the death of Nimrod, as if the time were well known, on 

the eighth of Tamooz, or July.--S.  [213] They tell us that Gabriel thrust his wing under them and 

lifted them up so high that the inhabitants of the lower heaven heard the barking of the dogs and 

the crowing of the cocks; and then, inverting them, threw them down to the earth.--S. (B.)  [214] It 

is the most received opinion among the Mohammadans that the son whom Abraham offered was 

Ishmael and not Isaac; Ishmael being his only son at that time: for the promise of Isaac's birth is 

mentioned lower, as subsequent in time to this transaction. They also allege the testimony of their 

prophet, who is reported to have said, 'I am the son of the two who were offered in sacrifice;' 

meaning his great ancestor, Ishmael, and his own father 'Abd-Allah: for 'Abd-el-Muttalib had made 

a vow that if God would permit him to find out and open the well Zemzem and should give him ten 

sons he would sacrifice one of them; accordingly, when he had obtained his desire in both 

respects, he cast lots on his sons, and the lot falling on 'Abd-Allah, he redeemed him by offering a 

hundred camels, which was therefore ordered to be the price of a man's blood in the Sunneh.--S. 

(B., Z.)  [215] The occasion of this request of Abraham is said to have been a doubt proposed to 

him by the devil in human form, how it was possible for the several parts of a corpse of a man 

which lay on the sea-shore and had been partly devoured by the wild beasts, the birds, and the 

fish, to be brought together at the resurrection.--S.  [216] In the original, 'Imam,' which answers to 

the Latin _Antistes_. This title the Mohammadans give to their priests [if such a title may be used, 

for want of one more correct] who begin the prayers in their mosques, and whom all the 

congregation the troubadours brooded the menacing figure of the Inquisition; and fair women no 

less than men knew the sinister meaning of "_La Question_" the inquisition by torture, by scores of 

devices of ingenious cruelty, of which the "rack" and the iron "boot" are best remembered. The 

brilliant life of the south was extinguished. We hear the piteous wail of the fast disappearing 

singers: "Oh! Toulouse and Provence, land of Agen, Beziers, and Carcassonne; as I have seen 

you, and as I see you now!"  While Provencal literature was thus perishing miserably, that of 

France was gradually unfolding; and we find here and there some _grande dame_ named as a 

patroness of literature. Most of them are but names, yet we find that the Countess Marie de 

Champagne, Queen Eleanor's daughter, encouraged the great _trouvere_ Chrestien de Troies. 

She made him introduce into his romances the notions of love and chivalry fostered in the Courts 

of Love, and gave him the theme of his romance of _Lancelot_, or _Le conte de la Charrette_ 

(about 1170). For Blanche de Navarre was made a prose translation of saints' lives. A poet named 

Menessier completed, about 1220, for the Countess Jeanne de Flandre a poem on Perceval and 

his search for the Holy Grail.  One French woman of this period, moreover, won for herself an 

abiding place in literature. Of her personality we know nothing, and we are even ignorant of the 

dates of her birth and death. Gathering her materials from Welsh and Breton traditions and 

popular songs, she wrote a number of _lays_, as she called them. These lays are short poems, in 

verse of eight syllables, recounting some little romantic tale or adventure. There are about twenty 

of them, of which fifteen, at least, are ascribed to Marie. From another of her works we glean the 

few facts that follow, substantially all that we know of her:  "At the end of this work, which I have 



translated and sung in the Romance tongue (French), I will tell you something of myself. Marie is 

my name, and I am of France. It may be that several clerks might take it upon themselves to claim 

my work, and I wish none to say it is his: who forgets himself works to 


_
[217] The term 'rek'ah' signifies the repetition of a set form of words, chiefly from the Kur-an, and 

ejaculations of 'God is most Great!' etc., accompanied by particular postures; part of the words 

being repeated in an erect posture, part sitting, and part in other postures: an inclination of the 

head and body, followed by two prostrations, distinguishing each rek'ah. Each of the five daily 

prayers of the Muslims consist of a certain number of rek'ahs.  [218] The city of Et-Taif was so 

called, according to Abu-l-Fida and most valiant man in this kingdom, I undertook to write this book 

and to translate it from English into Romance. He who wrote this book, or translated it, called it 

Ysopet. He translated it from Greek into Latin. King Henry (some manuscripts say Alfred), who 

loved it greatly, then translated it into English, and I have turned it into French verse as accurately 

as I could. Now I pray to God Almighty that I may be given strength to do such work that I may 

give my soul into His hands, that it may go straight to Heaven above. Say
