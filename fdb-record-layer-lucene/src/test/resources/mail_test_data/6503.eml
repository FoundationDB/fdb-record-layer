OGA, 1777.   In=20

1777 the British ministry had planned, in addition to the operations of the=
 main army against=20

Philadelphia, an invasion from Canada, apprehensions of which had led the A=
mericans into their=20

late unsuccessful attempt to conquer that province. Such supplies of men or=
 money as they asked=20

for were readily voted; but in England, as well as in America, enlistments =
were a matter of=20

difficulty. Lord George Germaine was possessed with an idea, of which Sir W=
illiam Howe found it=20

very difficult to disabuse him, that recruits might be largely obtained amo=
ng the American loyalists.=20

In spite, however, of all the efforts of Tryon, Delancey, and Skinner, the =
troops of that description=20

hardly amounted as yet to twelve hundred men; and Howe complained, not with=
out reason, of the=20

tardiness of the ministers in filling up his army.         *       *       =
*       *       *  The American=20

Northern Department, again placed under the sole command of Schuyler, had b=
een so bare of=20

troops during the winter that serious apprehensions had been felt lest Tico=
nderoga might be taken=20

by a sudden movement from Canada over the ice. The Northern army was still =
very feeble; and=20

the regiments designed to reinforce it filled up so slowly, notwithstanding=
 the offer of large=20

additional bounties, that Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire wer=
e obliged to resort=20

to a kind of conscription, a draft of militia men to serve for twelve month=
s as substitutes till the=20

regiments could be filled. In forming the first New England army, the enlis=
tment of negro slaves=20

had been specially prohibited; but recruits of any color were now gladly ac=
cepted, and many=20

negroes obtained their freedom by enlistment.  The Middle and Southern colo=
nies, whence=20

Washington=E2=80=99s recruits were principally to come, were still more beh=
ind-hand. Of the men enlisted=20

in those states, many were foreign-born, redemptioners, or indented servant=
s, whose attachment=20

to the cause could not fully be relied upon. Congress had offered bounties =
in land to such=20

Germans as might desert from the British, and Howe now retorted by promisin=
g rewards in money=20

to foreigners deserting the American service. Congress, as a countervailing=
 measure, at=20

Washington=E2=80=99s earnest request relinquished a plan they had adopted o=
f stopping a portion of the=20

pay of the indented servants in the army as a compensation to their masters=
 for loss of service.=20

That compensation was left to be provided for at the public expense, and th=
e enlisted servants=20

were all declared freemen.  Washington was still at Morristown, waiting wit=
h no little anxiety the=20

movements of the British. The expected reinforcements and supplies, especia=
lly tents, the want of=20

which had kept Howe from moving, had at last arrived. Burgoyne had assumed =

in New York. Nor=20

could he tell whether Howe would move up the Hudson to co-operate with Burg=
oyne, or whether=20

he would attempt Philadelphia; and if so, whether by land or water.  Philad=
elphia, however,=20

seemed the most probable object of attack; and the more effectually to cove=
r that city, leaving=20

Putnam in the Highlands with a division of Eastern troops, Washington, on M=
ay 28th, moved to a=20

piece of strong ground at Middlebrook, about twelve miles from Princeton. H=
e had with him forty-

three battalions, arranged in ten brigades and five divisions; but these ba=
ttalions were so far from=20

being full that the whole amounted to only eight thousand men.  On June 13t=
h Howe marched out=20

of New Brunswick with a powerful army, designing apparently to force his wa=
y to Philadelphia.=20

Washington called to his aid a large part of the troops in the Highlands; t=
he New Jersey militia=20

turned out in force; Arnold, to whom had been assigned the command at Phila=
delphia, was busy=20

with Mifflin in preparing defences for the Delaware. It was Howe=E2=80=99s =
real object, not so much to=20

penetrate to Philadelphia as to draw Washington out of his intrenchments an=
d to bring on a=20

general engagement, in which, upon anything like equal ground, the British =
general felt certain of=20

victory. With that intent he made a sudden and rapid retreat, evacuated New=
 Brunswick even, and=20

fell back to Amboy. The bait seemed to take; the American van, under Stirli=
ng, descended to the=20

low grounds, and Washington moved with the main body to Quibbletown. But wh=
en Howe turned=20

suddenly about and attempted to gain the passes and heights on the American=
 left, Washington,=20

ever on the alert, fell rapidly back to the strong ground at Middlebrook. I=
n this retrograde=20

movement Stirling=E2=80=99s division lost a few men and three pieces of art=
illery; but the American army=20

was soon in a position in which Howe did not choose to attack it.  Defeated=
 in this attempt to bring=20

on a general action, and having made up his mind to approach Philadelphia b=
y water, the British=20

commander, on June 30th, withdrew into Staten Island, where he embarked the=
 main body of his=20



army, not less than sixteen thousand strong, leaving Clinton, who had been =
lately honored with the=20

Order of the Bath, to hold New York with five thousand men, and, by expedit=
ions up the Hudson=20

and into New Jersey, to co-operate as well with Burgoyne as with the attack=
 upon Philadelphia.=20

Washington knew from spies, of whom he always had a number in New York, tha=
t a fleet of=20

transports was fitting out there, but its destination was kept secret. Perh=
aps Howe meant to=20

proceed up the Hudson to co-operate with Burgoyne; and the probability of s=
uch a movement=20

seemed to be increased by the arrival of news that Burgoyne was advancing u=
p Lake Champlain.=20

Perhaps, with the same object of aiding Burgoyne, Howe might make an attemp=
t upon Boston,=20

thus finding employment at home for the New England militia and preventing =
any reinforcements=20

to Schuyler=E2=80=99s army. Under these impressions, Washington moved slowl=
y toward the Hudson; but=20

when the British fleet went to sea, he retraced his steps toward the Delawa=
re; and news arriving=20

that the ships had been seen off Cape May, he advanced to Germantown. Inste=
ad of entering the=20

Delaware, the British fleet was presently seen steering to the eastward, an=
d all calculations were=20

thus again baffled. It was thought that Howe was returning to New York or h=
ad sailed for New=20

England, and the army was kept ready to march at a moment=E2=80=99s notice.=
 Washington, in the interval,=20

proceeded to Philadelphia and there had an interview with Congress.        =
 *       *       *       *       *=20

The force in Canada at Burgoyne=E2=80=99s disposal had been a good deal und=
errated by Washington and=20

by Congress; nor could they be induced to believe that anything was intende=
d in that quarter=20

beyond a feigned attack upon Ticonderoga, in order to distract attention fr=
om Philadelphia. Hence=20

the less pains had been taken to fill up the ranks of the Northern army, wh=
ich, indeed, was much=20

weaker than Congress had supposed. At least ten thousand men were necessary=
 for the defence=20

of Ticonderoga alone; but St. Clair, who commanded there, had only three th=
ousand, very=20

insufficiently armed and equipped. The posts in the rear were equally weak.=
  It was a part of=20

Burgoyne=E2=80=99s plan not merely to take Ticonderoga, but to advance then=
ce upon Albany, and, with=20

the co-operation of the troops at New York, to get possession also of the p=
osts in the Highlands.=20

The British would then command the Hudson through its whole extent, and New=
 England, the=20

head of the rebellion, would be completely cut off from the Middle and Sout=
hern colonies.=20

Burgoyne started on this expedition with a brilliant army of eight thousand=
 men, partly British and=20

partly Germans, besides a large number of Canadian boatmen, laborers, and s=
kirmishers. On the=20

western shore of Lake Champlain, near Crown Point, he met the Six Nations i=
n council, and, after=20

a feast and a speech, some four hundred of their warriors joined his army. =
His next step, on June=20

29th, was to issue a proclamation, in a very grandiloquent style, setting f=
orth his own and the=20

British power, painting in vivid colors the rage and fury of the Indians, s=
o difficult to be restrained,=20

and threatening with all the extremities of war all who should presume to r=
esist his arms.  Two=20

days after the issue of this proclamation, Burgoyne appeared before Ticonde=
roga. He occupied a=20

steep hill which overlooked the fort, and which the Americans had neglected=
 because they thought=20

it inaccessible to artillery. Preparations for attack were rapidly making, =
and St. Clair saw there was=20

no chance for his troops except in instant retreat. The baggage and stores,=
 placed in bateaux,=20

Whitehall, toward which point the troops retired by land, in a southeasterl=
y direction, through the=20

New Hampshire Grants.  While General Fraser pursued the retreating troops, =
followed by General=20

Riedesel with a corps of Germans, Burgoyne forced the obstructions opposite=
 Ticonderoga, and,=20

embarking several regiments, he speedily overtook the American stores and b=
aggage, all of which=20

fell into his hands.  [Illustration: BURGOYNE=E2=80=99S ROUTE]  The garriso=
n of Skenesborough,=20

informed of Burgoyne=E2=80=99s approach, set fire to the works and retreate=
d up Wood Creek to Fort Anne,=20

a post about half-way to the Hudson. They had a sharp skirmish with a Briti=
sh regiment which=20

followed them; but, other troops coming up, they set fire to the buildings =
at Fort Anne and retired to=20

Fort Edward.  The van of St. Clair=E2=80=99s troops, at the end of their fi=

 included many=20

stragglers, and amounted to twelve hundred men, contrary to St. Clair=E2=80=

when Riedesel came up with his Germans they too gave way. Francis was kille=
d, and many with=20

him; some two hundred were taken prisoners. Those who escaped, though dispe=
rsed for the=20

moment, reached St. Clair in detached parties. Warner, with some ninety men=
, came up two days=20

after the battle. This was at Rutland, to which place St. Clair, having hea=
rd of the fall of=20

Skenesborough had continued his retreat. For some time his whereabouts was =
unknown, but,=20

after a seven days=E2=80=99 march, he joined Schuyler at Fort Edward, on th=
e Hudson. Here was=20

assembled the=20


_
a non-Parity universe, perhaps?     Some things can't be simply inverted, a=
fter all....   Illustrated by=20

Brotman   [Illustration]   "You, Mr. Rapp?"  Stanley Rapp blinked, consider=
ing the matter. He=20

always thought over everything very carefully. Of course, some questions we=
re easier to answer=20

than others. This one, for instance. He had very few doubts about his name.=
  "Uh," Stanley Rapp=20

said. "Yes. Yes."  He stared at the bearded young man. Living in the Villag=
e, even on the better=20

side of it, one saw beards every day, all shapes and sizes of beard. This o=
ne was not a=20

psychoanalyst beard, or a folk singer beard; not even an actor beard. This =
was the scraggly=20

variety, almost certainly a poet beard. Mr. Rapp, while holding no particul=
ar prejudice against=20

poets, had not sent for one, he was thousand men; but a considerable part w=
ere militia hastily=20

called in, many were without arms, there was a great deficiency of ammuniti=
on and provisions, and=20

the whole force was quite disorganized.  The region between Skenesborough a=
nd the Hudson was=20

an almost unbroken wilderness. Wood Creek was navigable as far as Fort Anne=
; from Fort Anne=20

to the Hudson, over an exceedingly rough country, covered with thick woods =
and intersected by=20

numerous streams and morasses, extended a single military road. While Burgo=
yne halted a few=20

days at Skenesborough to put his forces in order and to bring up the necess=
ary supplies, Schuyler=20

hastened to destroy the navigation of Wood Creek by sinking impediments in =
its channel, and to=20

break up the bridges and causeways, of which there were fifty or more on th=
e road=20


_
Then he noticed the toolcase in the bearded young man's hand, lettered larg=
e LIGHTNING=20

SERVICE, TV, HI-FI.  "Oh," Stanley said, nodding. "You're the man to fix th=
e TV set."  "You know=20

it, Dad," the young man said, coming in. He shut the door behind him, and s=
tared around the=20

apartment. "What a wild pad. Where the idiot box, hey?"  The pleasantly fur=
nished, neat little=20

apartment was not what Mr. Rapp had ever thought of as a "wild pad." But th=
e Village had odd=20

standards, Mr. Rapp knew. Chacun a son gout, he had said, on moving into th=
e apartment ten=20

years ago. Not aloud, of course, because he had only taken one year of Fren=
ch, and would never=20

have trusted his accent. But chacun a son gout, anyway.  "The television se=
t," Mr. Rapp said,=20

translating. "Oh, yes." He went to the closet door and opened it. Reaching =
inside, he brought out=20

an imposingly large TV set, mounted on a wheeled table. The bearded repairm=
an whistled.  "In the=20

closet," the repairman said, admiringly. "Crazy. You go in there to watch i=
t, or you let it talk to=20

itself?"  "Oh. Well, I don't exactly watch it at all," Mr. Rapp said, a lit=
tle sadly. "I mean, I can't.=20

That's why I called you."  "Lightning's here, have no fear," the bearded on=
e said, approaching the=20

set with a professional air. "Like, in the closet, hey." He bent over the s=
et, appraisingly. "I thought=20

you were a square, Pops, but I can see you're.... Hey, this is like too muc=
h. Man, I don't want to=20

pry, but why is this box upside down?"  "I wish I knew," Mr. Rapp said. He =
sat down, and leaned=20

back, sighing. This was going to be difficult, he knew. He had already had =
to explain it to the last=20

three repairmen, and he was getting tired of explaining. Although he though=
t, somehow, that this=20

young man might understand it a little more quickly than the others had.  "=
I've had a couple of=20

other repairmen look it over," Mr. Rapp told the bearded one. "They ... wel=
l, they gave up."=20

"Dilettantes," commented the beard.  "Oh, no," Mr. Rapp said. "One of them =
was from the=20

company that made it. But they couldn't do anything."  "Let's try it," the =
Fort Anne to Fort Edward.=20

At all those points where the construction of a side passage would be diffi=
cult he ordered trees to=20

be felled across the road with their branches interlocking. All the stock i=
n the neighborhood was=20

driven off, and the militia of New England was summoned to the rescue.  The=
 loss of Ticonderoga,=20

with its numerous artillery, and the subsequent rapid disasters came like a=
 thunderbolt on=20

Congress and the Northern States. =E2=80=9CWe shall never be able to defend=
 a post,=E2=80=9D wrote John Adams,=20

President of the Board of War, in a private letter, =E2=80=9Ctill we shoot =
a general.=E2=80=9D Disasters, the=20

unavoidable result of weakness, were ascribed to the incapacity or cowardic=
e of the officers.=20

Suggestions of treachery even were whispered, and the prejudices of the New=
-Englanders against=20

Schuyler broke out with new violence. In the anger and vexation of the mome=
nt, all the Northern=20

generals were recalled, and an inquiry was ordered into their conduct; but =
the execution of this=20

order was suspended on the representation of Washington that the Northern a=
rmy could not be left=20

without officers. Washington shared the general surprise and vexation, but =
he had confidence in=20

Schuyler, and he did all in his power to reinforce the Northern army. Two b=
rigades from the=20

Highlands, Morgan with his rifle corps, the impetuous Arnold, and Lincoln, =
a great favorite with the=20

Massachusetts militia, were ordered to the Northern Department. Washington =
declined the=20

selection of a new commander tendered to him by Congress, and that selectio=
n, guided by the=20

New England members, fell upon Gates.  Burgoyne meanwhile issued a new proc=
lamation for a=20

convention of ten deputies from each township, to assemble at Castleton, to=
 confer with Governor=20

Skene, and to take measures for the re-establishment of the royal authority=
. Schuyler, in a=20

counter-proclamation, threatened the utmost rigor of the law of treason aga=
inst all who complied=20



with Burgoyne=E2=80=99s propositions. Subsequently to the Declaration of In=
dependence, the inhabitants of=20

Vermont had organized themselves into an independent state, had applied=20

side down position. The=20

big screen lit almost at once; a pained face appeared, with a large silhoue=
tted hammer striking the=20

image's forehead in a rhythmic beat.  "... Immediate relief from headache,"=
 a bland voice said, as=20

the pictured face broke into a broad smile. The repairman shuddered, and tu=
rned down the sound,=20

staring at the image with widened eyes as he did so.  "Dad, I don't want to=
 bug you," the=20

repairman said, his eyes still on the screen, "only, look. The set is upsid=
e down, right?"  "Right,"=20

said Mr. Rapp.  "Only the picture--" the repairman paused, trying to find U=
nion, and had adopted a=20

constitution. A Continental regiment had been raised and officered in Vermo=
nt, of which Warner=20

had been commissioned as colonel. But Congress, through the influence of Ne=
w York, disclaimed=20

any intention to countenance the pretensions of Vermont to independence; an=
d the Vermont=20

petition for admission into the Union had been lately dismissed with some a=
sperity. If Burgoyne,=20

however, founded any hopes of defection upon this circumstance, he found hi=
mself quite=20

mistaken.  The advance from Skenesborough cost the British infinite labor a=
nd fatigue; but,=20

beyond breaking up the roads and placing obstacles in their way, Schuyler w=
as not=20
