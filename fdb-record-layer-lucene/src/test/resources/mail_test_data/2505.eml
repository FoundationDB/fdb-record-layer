e Gospels, does not=20

pretend to organize mankind ecclesiastically or politically, but simply sup=
plies a new type of=20

character, and a new motive power, leaving government, ritual and organizat=
ion of every kind to=20

determine themselves from age to age. Comte's prohibition of inquiry into t=
he composition of the=20

stars, which his priesthood, had it been installed in power, would perhaps =
have converted into a=20

compulsory article of faith, is only a specimen of his general tendency (th=
e common tendency, as=20

we have said, of all Utopias) to impose on human progress the limits of his=
 own mind. Let his=20

hierarchy become masters of the world, and the effect would probably be lik=
e that produced by the=20

ascendency of a hierarchy (enlightened no doubt for its time) in Egypt, a b=
rief start forward=20

followed by consecrated immobility for ever.  Lareveillere Lepaux, a member=
 of the French=20

Directory, invented a new religion of Theo-philanthropy which seems in fact=
 to have been an=20

organized Rousseauism. He wished to impose it on France but finding that in=
 spite of his=20

passionate endeavours he made but little progress he sought the advice of T=
alleyrand. "I am not=20

surprised" said Talleyrand "at the difficulty you experience. It is no easy=
 matter to introduce a new=20

religion. But I will tell you what I recommend you to do. I recommend you t=
o be crucified and to rise=20

again on the third day." We cannot say whether Lareveillere made any prosel=
ytes but if he did=20

their number cannot have been much smaller than the reputed number of the r=
eligious disciples of=20

Comte. As a philosophy, Comtism has found its place and exercised its share=
 of influence among=20

the philosophies of the time but as a religious system it appears to make l=
ittle way. It is the=20

invention of a man not the spontaneous expression of the beliefs and feelin=
gs of mankind. Any=20

one with a tolerably lively imagination might produce a rival system with a=
s little practical effect.=20

Roman Catholicism was at all events a growth not an invention.  Cosmic Emot=
ion, though it does=20

not affect to be an organized system, is the somewhat sudden creation of in=
dividual minds set at=20

work apparently by the exigencies of a particular situation and on that acc=
ount suggestive _prima=20

facie_ of misgivings similar to those suggested by the invention of Comte. =
 Now is the worship of=20

Humanity or Cosmic Emotion really a substitute for religion? That is the on=
ly question which we=20

wish in these few pages to ask. We do not pretend here to inquire what is o=
r what is not true in=20

itself.  Religion teaches that we have our being in a Power whose character=
 and purposes are=20

indicated to us by our moral nature, in whom we are united and by the union=
 made sacred to each=20

other, whose voice conscience however generated, is whose eye is always upo=
n us, sees all our=20

acts, and sees them as they are morally, without reference to worldly succe=
ss or to the opinion of=20

the world, to whom at death we return, and our relations to whom, together =
with his own nature,=20

are an assurance that according as we promote or fail to promote his design=
 by self improvement=20

and the improvement of our kind, it will be well or ill for us in the sum o=
f things. This is a=20

hypothesis evidently separable from belief in a revelation, and from any sp=
ecial theory respecting=20

the next world, as well as from all dogma and ritual. It may be true or fal=
se in itself, capable of=20

demonstration or incapable. We are concerned here solely with its practical=
 efficiency, compared=20

Monticello, Florida November 10, 1936  DOUGLAS PARISH   Douglas Parish was =
born in=20

Monticello, Florida, May 7, 1850, to Charles and Fannie Parish, slaves of J=
im Parish. Fannie had=20

been bought from a family by the name of Palmer to be a "breeder", that is =
a bearer of strong=20

children who could bring high prices at the slave markets. A "breeder" alwa=
ys fared better than the=20

majority of female slaves, and Fannie Parish was no exception. All she had =
to do was raise=20

children. Charles Parish labored in the cotton fields, the chief product of=
 the Parish plantation.  As=20

a small boy Douglas used to spend his time shooting marbles, playing ball, =
racing and wrestling=20

with the other boys. The marbles were made from lumps of clay hardened in t=
he fireplace. He was=20

a very good runner, and as it was a custom in those days for one plantation=
 owner to match his=20

"nigger" against that of his neighbor, he was a favorite with Parish becaus=
e he seldom failed to win=20

the race. Parish trained his runners by having them race to the boundary of=
 his plantation and=20

back again. He substitutes. It is only necessary to remark, that there is n=
othing about the religious=20

hypothesis as here stated, miraculous, supernatural, or mysterious, except =
so far as those epithets=20

may be applied to anything beyond the range of bodily sense, say the influe=
nce of opinion or=20

affection. A universe self-made, and without a God, is at least as great a =
mystery as a universe=20

with a God; in fact the very attempt to conceive it in the mind produces a =
moral vertigo which is a=20

bad omen for the practical success of Cosmic Emotion.  For this religion ar=
e the service and=20

worship of Humanity likely to be a real equivalent in any respect, as motiv=
e power, as restraint, or=20

as comfort? Will the idea of life in God be adequately replaced by that of =
an interest in the=20

condition and progress of Humanity, as they may affect us and be influenced=
 by our conduct,=20

together with the hope of human gratitude and fear of human reprobation aft=
er death, which the=20

Comtists endeavor to organize into a sort of counterpart of the Day of Judg=
ment?  It will probably=20

be at once conceded that the answer must be in the negative as regards the =
immediate future and=20

the mass of mankind. The simple truths of religion are intelligible to all,=
 and strike all minds with=20

equal force, though they may not have the same influence with all moral nat=
ures. A child learns=20

them perfectly at its mother's knee. Honest ignorance in the mine, on the s=
ea, at the forge, striving=20

to do its coarse and perilous duty, performing the lowliest functions of hu=
manity, contributing in the=20

humblest way to human progress, itself scarcely sunned by a ray of what mor=
e cultivated natures=20

would deem happiness, takes in as fully as the sublimest philosopher the id=
ea of a God who sees=20

and cares for all, who keeps account of the work well done or the kind act,=
 marks the secret fault,=20

and will hereafter make up to duty for the hardness of its present lot. But=
 a vivid interest--such an=20

interest as will act both as a restraint and as a comfort--in the condition=
 and future of humanity can=20

surely exist only in those who have a knowledge of history sufficient to en=
able them to embrace=20

the unity of the past, and an imagination sufficiently cultivated to glow w=
ith anticipation of the=20

future. For the bulk of mankind the humanity worshippers point of view seem=
s unattainable at least=20



within any calculable time.  As to posthumous reputation good or evil it is=
 and always must be the=20

appendage of a few marked men. The plan of giving it substance by instituti=
ng separate burial=20

places for the virtuous and the wicked is perhaps not very seriously propos=
ed. Any such plan=20

involves the fallacy of a sharp division where there is no clear moral line=
 besides postulating not=20

only an unattainable knowledge of men's actions but a knowledge still more =
manifestly=20

unattainable of their hearts. Yet we cannot help thinking that on the men o=
f intellect to whose=20

teaching the world is listening this hope of posthumous reputation, or to p=
ut it more plainly, of living=20

in the gratitude and affection of their kind by means of their scientific d=
iscoveries and literary works=20

exercises an influence of which they are hardly conscious, it prevents them=
 from fully feeling the=20

void which the annihilation of the hope of future existence leaves in the h=
earts of ordinary men.=20

Besides so far as we are aware no attempt has yet been made to show us dist=
inctly what=20

humanity is and wherein its holiness consists. If the theological hypothesi=
s is true and all men are=20

united in God, humanity is a substantial reality, but otherwise we fail to =
see that it is any thing=20

more than a metaphysical abstraction converted into an actual entity by phi=
losophers who are not=20

generally kind to metaphysics. Even the unity of the species is far from se=
ttled, science still=20

debates whether there is one race of men or whether there are more than a h=
undred. Man acts on=20

man no doubt, but he also acts on other animals, and other animals on him. =
Wherein does the=20

special unity or the special bond consist? Above all what constitutes the h=
oliness? Individual men=20

are not holy, a large proportion of them are very much the reverse. Why is =
the aggregate holy? Let=20

the unit be a complex phenomenon, an organism or whatever name science may =
give it, what=20

multiple of it will be a rational object of worship?  For our own part we c=
annot conceive worship=20

being offered by a sane worshipper to any but a conscious being, in other w=
ords to a person. The=20

fetish worshipper himself probably invests his fetish with a vague personal=
ity such as would render=20

it capable of propitiation. But how can we invest with a collective persona=
lity the fleeting=20

generations of mankind? Even the sum of mankind is never complete, much les=
s are the units=20

blended into a personal whole, or as it has been called a colossal man.  Th=
ere is a gulf here, as it=20

seems to us, which cannot be bridged, and can barely be hidden from view by=
 the retention of=20

religious phraseology. In truth, the anxious use of that phraseology betray=
s weakness, since it=20

shows that you cannot do without the theological associations which cling i=
nseparably to religious=20

terms.  You look forward to a closer union, a more complete brotherhood of =
man, an increased=20

sacredness of the human relation. Some things point that way; some things p=
oint the other way.=20

Brotherhood has hardly a definite meaning without a father; sacredness can =
hardly be predicated=20

without anything which consecrates. We can point to an eminent writer who t=
ells you that he=20

detests the idea of brotherly love altogether; that there are many of his k=
ind whom, so far from=20

loving, he hates, and that he would like to write his hatred with a lash up=
on their backs. Look again=20

at the severe Prussianism which betrays itself in the New=20


_
would reward the winner with a jack-knife or a bag of marbles.  Just to be =
first was an honor in=20

itself, for the fastest runner represented his master in the Fourth of July=
 races when runners from=20

all over the country competed for top honors, and the winner earned a bag o=
f silver for his master.=20

If Parish didn't win the prize, he was hard to get along with for several d=
ays, but gradually he=20

would accept his defeat with resolution. Prizes in less important races ran=
ged from a pair of=20

fighting cocks to a slave, depending upon the seriousness of the betting.  =
Douglas' first job was=20

picking cotton seed from the cotton. When he was about 12 years of age, he =
became the stable=20

boy, and soon learned about the care and grooming of horses from an old sla=
ve who had charge=20

of the Parish stables. He was also required to keep the buggies, surreys, a=
nd spring-wagons=20

clean. The buggies were light four-wheeled carriages drawn by one horse. Th=
e surreys were=20

covered four-wheeled carriages, open at the sides, but having curtains that=
 may be rolled down.=20

He liked this job very much because it gave him an opportunity to ride on t=
he horses, the desire of=20

all the boys on the plantation. They had to be content with chopping wood, =
running errands,=20

cleaning up the plantation, and similar tasks. Because of his knowledge of =
horses, Douglas was=20

permitted to travel to the coast with his boss and other slaves for the pur=
pose of securing salt from=20

the sea water. It was cheaper to secure salt by this method than it was to =
purchase it otherwise.=20

Life in slavery was not all bad, according to Douglas. Parish fed his slave=
s well, gave them=20

comfortable quarters in which to live, looked after them when they were sic=
k, and worked them=20

very moderately. The food was cooked in the fireplace in large iron pots, p=
ans and ovens. The=20

slaves had greens, potatoes, corn, rice, meat, peas, and corn bread to eat.=
 Occasionally the corn=20

bread was replaced by flour bread. The slaves drank an imitation coffee mad=
e from parched corn=20

or meal. Since there was no ice to preserve the left-over food, only enough=
 for each meal was=20

prepared.  Parish seldom punished his slaves, and never did he permit his o=
verseer to do so. If the=20

slaves failed to do their work, they were reported to him. He would warn th=
em and show his black=20

whip which was usually sufficient. He had seen overseers beat slaves to dea=
th, and he did not=20

want to risk losing the money he had invested in his. After his death, his =
son managed the=20

plantation in much the same manner as his father.  But the war was destined=
 to make the Parishes=20

lose all their slaves by giving them their freedom. Even Strauss. Look at t=
he oligarchy of=20

enlightenment and enjoyment which Renan, in his _Moral Reform of France_, p=
roposes to institute=20

for the benefit of a select circle, with sublime indifference to the lot of=
 the vulgar, who, he says,=20

"must subsist on the glory and happiness of others." This does not look muc=
h like a nearer=20

approach to a brotherhood of man than is made by the Gospel. We are speakin=
g, of course,=20

merely of the comparative moral efficiency of religion and the proposed sub=
stitutes for it, apart=20

from the influence exercised over individual conduct by the material needs =
and other non-

theological forces of society.  For the immortality of the individual soul,=
 with the influences of that=20

belief, we are asked to substitute the immortality of the race. But here, i=
n addition to the difficulty of=20

proving the union and intercommunion of all the members, we are met by the =
objection that unless=20

we live in God, the race, in all probability, is not immortal. That our pla=
net and all it contains will=20

come to an end appears to be the decided opinion of science. This "holy" be=
ing, our relation to=20

which is to take the place of our relation to an Eternal Father, by the ado=
ration of which we are to=20

be sustained and controlled, if it exist at all, is as ephemeral compared w=
ith eternity as a fly. We=20

shall be told that we ought to be content with an immortality extending thr=
ough tens of thousands,=20



perhaps hundreds of thousands, of years. To the _argumentum ad verecundiam_=
 there is no=20

reply. But will this banish the thought of ultimate annihilation? Will it p=
revent a man, when he is=20

called upon to make some great sacrifice for the race, from saying to himse=
lf, that, whether he=20

makes the sacrifice or not, one day all will end in nothing?  Evidently the=
se are points which must=20

be made quite clear before you can, with any prospect of success, call upon=
 men either to regard=20

Humanity with the same feelings with which they have regarded God, or to gi=
ve up their own=20

interest or enjoyment for the future benefit of the race. The assurance der=
ived from the fondness=20

felt by parents for their offspring, and the self-denying efforts made for =
the good of children, will=20

hardly carry us very far, even supposing it certain that parental love woul=
d remain unaffected by=20

the general change. It is evidently a thing apart from the general love of =
Humanity. Nobody was=20

ever more extravagantly fond of his children, or made greater efforts for t=
hem, than Alexander=20

Borgia.  It has been attempted, however, with all the fervour of conviction=
, and with all the force of=20

a powerful style, to make us see not only that we have this corporal=20


_
slaves elected to remain with their mistress who had always been kind to th=
em. The war swept=20

away much of the money which her husband had left her; and although she wou=
ld liked to have=20

kept all of her slaves, she found it impossible to do so. She allowed the r=
eal old slaves to remain=20

on the premises and kept a few of the younger ones to work about the planta=
tion. Douglas and his=20

parents were among those who remained on the plantation. His father was a s=
killed bricklayer and=20

carpenter, and he was employed to make repairs to the property. His mother =
cooked for the=20

Parishes.  Many of the Negroes migrated North, and they wrote back stories =
of the "new country"=20

where "de white folks let you do jes as you please." These stories influenc=
ed a great number of=20

other Negroes to go North and begin life anew as servants, waiters, laborer=
s and cooks. The=20

Negroes who remained in the South were forced to make their own living. At =
the end of the war,=20

foods and commodities had gone up to prices that were impossible for the Ne=
gro to pay. Ham, for=20

example, cost 40c and 50c a pound; lard was 25c; cotton was two dollars a b=
ushel.  Douglas'=20

father taught him all that he knew about carpentry and bricklaying, and the=
 two were in demand to=20

repair, remodel, or build houses for the white people. Although he never at=
tended school, Charles=20

Parish could calculate very rapidly the number of bricks that it would take=
 to build a house. After=20

the establishing of schools by the Freedmen's Bureau, Douglas' father made =
him go, but he did=20

not like the confinement of school and soon dropped out. The teachers for t=
he most part, were=20

white, who were concerned only with teaching the ex-slaves reading, writing=
, and arithmetic. The=20

few colored teachers went into the community in an effort to elevate the st=
andards of living. They=20

went into the churches where they were certain to reach the greatest number=
 of people and spoke=20

to them of their mission. The Negro teachers were cordially received by the=
 ex-slaves who were=20

glad to welcome some "Yankee niggers" into their midst.  Whereas the white =
teachers did not=20

bother with the Negroes except in the classroom, other white men came who s=
howed a decided=20

interest in them. They were called "carpetbaggers" because of the type of t=
raveling bag which they=20

usually carried, and this term later became synonymous with "political adve=
nturer." These men=20

sought to advance their political schemes by getting the Negroes to vote fo=
r certain men who=20

would be favorable to that we may look forward to an actual though imperson=
al existence in the=20

shape of the prolongation through all future time of the consequences of ou=
r lives. It might with=20

equal truth be said that we have enjoyed an actual though impersonal existe=
nce through all time=20

past in our antecedents. But neither in its consequences nor in its anteced=
ents can anything be=20

said to live except by a figure. The characters and actions of men surely w=
ill never be influenced=20

by such a fanciful use of language as this! Our being is consciousness; wit=
h consciousness our=20

being ends, though our physical forces may be conserved, and traces of our =
conduct--traces=20

utterly indistinguishable--may remain. That with which we are not concerned=
 cannot affect us=20

either presently or by anticipation; and with that of which we shall never =
be conscious, we shall=20

never feel that we are concerned. Perhaps if the authors of this new immort=
ality would tell us what=20

they understand by non-existence, we might be led to value more highly by c=
ontrast the existence=20

which they propose for a soul when it has ceased to think or feel, and for =
an organism when it has=20

been scattered to the winds.  They would persuade us that their impersonal =
and unconscious=20

immortality is a brighter hope than an eternity of personal and conscious e=
xistence, the very=20

thought of which they say is torture. This assumes, what there seems to be =
no ground for=20

assuming, that eternity is an endless extension of time; and, in the same w=
ay, that infinity is a=20



boundless space. It is more natural to conceive of them as emancipation res=
pectively from time=20

and space, and from the conditions which time and space involve; and among =
the conditions of=20

time may apparently be reckoned the palling of pleasure or of existence by =
mere temporal=20

protraction. Even as we are, sensual pleasure palls; so does the merely int=
ellectual: but can the=20

same be said of the happiness of virtue and affection? It is urged, too, th=
at by exchanging the=20

theological immortality for one of physical and social consequences, we get=
 rid of the burden of=20

self, which otherwise we should drag for ever. But surely in this there is =
a confusion of self with=20

selfishness. Selfishness is another name for vice. Self is merely conscious=
ness. Without a self,=20

how can there be self-sacrifice? How can the most unselfish motive exist if=
 there is nothing to be=20

moved? "He that findeth his life, shall lose it; and he that loseth his lif=
e, shall find it," is not a=20

doctrine of=20


_
unimportant office to obtain the goodwill of the ex-slaves. They used the i=
gnorant colored minister=20

to further their plans, and he was their willing tool. The Negro's unwise u=
se of his ballot plunged=20

the South further and further into debt and as a result the South was compe=
lled to restrict his=20

privileges.   REFERENCE  1. Personal interview with Douglas Parish, Montice=

Worker Palatka, Florida November 9, 1936  GEORGE PRETTY   George Pretty of =
Vero Beach=20

and Gifford, Florida, was born a free man, at Altoona, Pennsylvania, Januar=
y 30, 1852. His father=20

Isaac Pretty was also free born. His maternal grand-father Alec McCoy and h=
is paternal grand-

father George Pretty were born slaves who lived in the southern part of Pen=
nsylvania.  He does=20

not know how his father came to be born free but knows that he was told tha=
t from early childhood.=20

In Altoona, according to George, there were no slaves during his life there=
 but in southern=20

Pennsylvania slavery existed for a time. His grand-parents moved from south=
ern Pennsylvania=20

during slavery but whether they bought their freedom or ran away from their=
 masters was never=20

known to George.  As in most of the southland, the customs of the Negro in =
Altoona abounded in=20

superstition and ignorance. They had about the same beliefs and looked upon=
 life with about the=20

same degree of intelligence as Negroes in the south.  The north being much =
colder than the south=20

naturally had long ago used coal for fuel. Open grates were used for cookin=
g just as open=20

Frederick to his grenadiers--"Do you want to live for ever?" The grenadiers=
 might have answered,=20

"Yes; and therefore we are ready to die."  It is not when we think of the l=
oss of anything to which a=20

taint of selfishness can adhere--it is not even when we think of intellectu=
al effort cut short for ever=20

by death just as the intellect has ripened and equipped itself with the nec=
essary knowledge--that=20

the nothingness of this immortality of conservated forces is most keenly fe=
lt: it is when we think of=20

the miserable end of affection. How much comfort would it afford anyone ben=
ding over the=20

deathbed of his wife to know that forces set free by her dissolution will c=
ontinue to mingle=20

impersonally and indistinguishably with forces set free by the general mort=
ality? Affection, at all=20

events, requires personality. One cannot love a group of consequences, even=
 supposing that the=20

filiation could be distinctly presented to the mind. Pressed by the hand of=
 sorrow craving for=20

comfort, this Dead Sea fruit crumbles into ashes, paint it with eloquence a=
s you will.  Humanity, it=20

seems to us, is a fundamentally Christian idea, connected with the Christia=
n view of the relations=20

of men to their common Father and of their spiritual union in the Church. I=
n the same way the idea=20

of the progress of Humanity seems to us to have been derived from the Chris=
tian belief in the=20

coming of the Kingdom of God through the extension of the Church, and to th=
at final triumph of=20

good over evil foretold in the imagery of the Apocalypse. At least the foun=
ders of the Religion of=20

Humanity will admit that the Christian=20


_
were used in the south. Iron skillets or spiders as they called them, were =
used for cooking many=20

foods, meats, vegetables, pies puddings and even cakes were baked over the =
fire.  The old=20

familiar, often referred to as southern ash cake, was cooked on the hearth =
under the grate, right in=20

Altoona, Pennsylvania. The north because of its rapid advance in the use of=
 modern ways of=20

cooking and doing many other things has been thought by many people to have=
 escaped the=20

crude methods of cooking, but not so. George told how a piece of thick pape=
r was placed on the=20

hearth under the grate and corn dough put upon it to bake. Hot ashes were r=
aked over it and it=20

was left to cook and brown. When it had remained a long enough time, the as=
hes were shaken off,=20

the cake brushed clean with a cloth and no grit was encountered when it was=
 eaten.  Isaac Pretty,=20

George's father owned a large harness shop at Altoona and made and sold hun=
dreds of dollars=20

worth of saddles and harness to both northern and southern plantation owner=
s. (1)  There was a=20

constant going and of theirs so much their very nomenclature proves and we =
would fain ask them=20

to review the process of disengagement and see whether the essence has not =
been left behind.=20

No doubt there are influences at work in modern civilisation which tend to =
the strengthening of the=20

sentiment of humanity by making men more distinctly conscious of their posi=
tion as members of a=20

race. On the other hand the unreflecting devotion of the tribesman which he=
ld together primitive=20

societies dies. Man learns to reason and calculate and when he is called up=
on to immolate himself=20

to the common interest of the race he will consider what the common interes=
t of the race when he=20

is dead and gone will be to him and whether he will ever be repaid for his =
sacrifice.  Of Cosmic=20

Emotion it will perhaps be fair to say that it is proposed as a substitute =
for religious emotion rather=20

than as a substitute for religion since nothing has been said about embodyi=
ng it in a cult. It comes=20

to locate runaway slaves.  Abolitionists were active in the north and there=
 were those who assisted=20

 the north who were=20

free and had intelligence enough saw the gravity in assisting need of the c=

may well seek all the aid that the witchery of poetry can supply. Unluckily=
 we are haunted by the=20

consciousness that the poetry itself is blindly ground out by the same illi=

which grinds out Virtue=20
