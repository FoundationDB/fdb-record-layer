Every separate nation now arranged for itself a religious system, according=
 to its enlightenment=20

and spiritual wants. Worship of mere form being discarded by the wise men, =
these confined true=20

knowledge to the very few. The need of veiling truth to protect it from des=
ecration becoming more=20

apparent with every generation, a thin veil was used at first, which had to=
 be gradually thickened=20

according to the spread of personality and selfishness, and this led to the=
 Mysteries. They came to=20

be established in every country and among every people, while to avoid stri=
fe and=20

misunderstanding exoteric beliefs were allowed to grow up in the minds of t=
he profane masses.=20

Inoffensive and innocent in their incipient stage--like a historical event =
arranged in the form of a=20

fairy tale, adapted for and comprehensible to the child's mind--in those di=
stant ages such beliefs=20

could be allowed to grow and make the popular faith without any danger to t=
he more philosophical=20

and abstruse truths taught in the sanctuaries. Logical and scientific obser=
vation of the phenomena=20

in Nature, which alone leads man to is not so young as he was, my dear fell=
ow; besides, he has=20

grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service."  "That may =
be true," replied Porthos;=20

"but I am used to him, and besides, he wouldn't be willing to let me go wit=
hout him, he loves me so=20

much."  "Oh, blind self-love!" thought D'Artagnan.  "And you," asked Portho=
s, "haven't you still in=20

your service your old lackey, that good, that brave, that intelligent---wha=
t, then, is his name?"=20

"Planchet--yes, I have found him again, but he is lackey no longer."  "What=
 is he, then?"  "With his=20

sixteen hundred francs--you remember, the sixteen hundred francs he earned =
at the siege of La=20

Rochelle by carrying a letter to Lord de Winter--he has set up a little sho=
p in the Rue des=20

Lombards and is now a confectioner."  "Ah, he is a confectioner in the Rue =
des Lombards! How=20

does it happen, then, that he is in your service?"  "He has been guilty of =
certain escapades and=20

fears he may be disturbed." And the musketeer narrated to his friend Planch=
et's adventure.=20

"Well," said Porthos, "if any one had told you in the old times that=20

tual eye before he=20

marvels of the One Spirit of Truth, the ever-concealed and inaccessible Dei=
ty, can be unravelled=20

and assimilated only through Its manifestations by the secondary "Gods," It=
s acting powers. While=20

the One and Universal Cause has to remain for ever _in abscondito_, Its man=
ifold action may be=20

traced through the effects in Nature. The latter alone being comprehensible=
 and manifest to=20

average mankind, the Powers causing those effects were allowed to grow in t=
he imagination of the=20

populace. Ages later in the Fifth, the Aryan, Race some unscrupulous priest=
s began to take=20

advantage of the too-easy beliefs of the people in every country, and final=
ly raised those=20

secondary Powers to the rank of God and Gods, thus succeeding in isolating =
them altogether from=20

the One Universal Cause of all causes.(489)  Henceforward the knowledge of =
the primeval truths=20

remained entirely in the hands of the Initiates.  The Mysteries had their w=
eak points and their=20

defects, as every institution welded with the human element must necessaril=
y have. Yet Voltaire=20

scue Rochefort and=20

 men are changed by=20

events."  "There is nothing truer than that," said Porthos; "but what does =
not change, or changes=20

for the better, is wine. Taste of this; it is a Spanish wine which our frie=
nd Athos thought much of."=20

At that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedin=
gs of the next day=20

and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed.  "Tell =
me, Mouston," said=20

Porthos, "are my arms in good condition?"  "Your arms, my lord--what arms?"=
  "Zounds! my=20

weapons."  "What weapons?"  "My military weapons."  "Yes, my lord; at any r=
ate, I think so."=20

"Make sure of it, and if they want it, have them burnished up. Which is my =
best cavalry horse?"=20

"Vulcan."  "And the best hack?"  "Bayard."  "What horse dost thou choose fo=
r thyself?"  "I like=20

Rustaud, my lord; a good animal, whose paces suit me."  "Strong, thinkest t=
hou?"  "Half Norman,=20

half Mecklenburger; will go night and day."  "That will do for us. See to t=
hese horses. Polish up or=20

make some one else polish my arms. Then take pistols with thee and a huntin=
g-knife."  "Are we=20

then going to travel, my lord?" asked Mousqueton, rather uneasy.=20
