 He is a very handsome young man, and clever. He has youth and health, and =
his whole life before him, what more can he want? But the narrow-minded inh=
abitants of the little town are at present only occupied with one question,=
 viz., whom will he marry? Why, Katka Krikovszky _
the man hanging on to the tail of the horse is a most alluring bait, and he=
 would certainly be taken,=20

should one of these horrible monsters be attracted to the party. I have alw=
ays found great comfort=20

in crossing a river by simply holding to the mane, just in front of the sad=
dle, with my left hand, with=20

the bridle grasped as loosely as possible, so that the horse does not feel =
the bit; in this position, on=20

the off side, the animal does not feel any hindrance; the man not only can =
direct his horse, but his=20

presence gives it confidence, as he can speak to it coaxingly while swimmin=
g with one arm by its=20

side. Upon landing, he at once controls the horse by the reins within his l=
eft grasp.  Many horses=20

become exceedingly scared in swimming a rapid river, and will frequently lo=
se their presence of=20

mind, and swim with the current, in which case they may miss the favourable=
 landing place; if the=20

man holds by the tail, he has no control over the horse upon landing, and, =
if wild or vicious, the=20

animal will probably kick up its heels and bolt away, leaving the unfortuna=
te proprietor helpless. In=20

swimming a river with the horse, the powder, &c. should be made into a parc=
el with your outer=20

garment, and tied upon the head; then lead your horse gently into the water=
, and for a moment=20

allow it to drink, to prevent all shyness; continue to lead it until you lo=
se your depth, when, by=20

holding with your left hand to the mane, both horse and man will cross with=
 perfect ease.  We had=20

crossed the river, and, as we passed through an opening in the belt of jung=
le on the banks, and=20

entered upon a plain interspersed with clumps of bush, we perceived, at abo=
ut two hundred yards=20

distance, a magnificent lion, whose shaggy yellow mane gave him a colossal =
appearance, as he=20

stalked quietly along the flat sandy ground towards the place of his daily =
retreat. The aggageers=20

whispered, "El Assut!" (the lion), and instinctively the swords flashed fro=
m their sheaths. In an=20

instant, the horses were at full speed sweeping over the level ground. The =
lion had not observed=20

us; but, upon hearing the sound of the hoofs, he halted and raised his head=
, regarding us for a=20

moment with of them. They bought it together, and both signed their names t=
o the deeds.  On the=20

day they received the key of the house from the guardian, they both went th=
ere, shut themselves=20

in, and began to pull down the inner wall with the pickaxes they had brough=
t with them under their=20

cloaks. Of course they found the caldron, but what was in it has not become=
 clear to this day,=20

though that was the chief point to be settled in the Gregorics lawsuit, whi=
ch took up the attention of=20

the Besztercebanya law courts for ten years.  It began in this way. A few m=
onths after the=20

purchase of "Lebanon," Prepelicza appeared on the scene, and demanded his s=
hare of the=20

treasure discovered in the wall, otherwise he would make known the whole af=
fair to Mrs. Panyoki.=20

The brothers got mad with rage at the sight of him.  "You miserable thief!"=
 they cried. "You were a=20

party to the fraud practised upon us by that good-for-nothing brother of ou=
rs, who wanted to rob us=20

in order to benefit that boy. You helped him to fill the caldron with rusty=
 nails and bits of old iron.=20

Now you are here, you may as well have your share."  With that they each se=
ized hold of a stick,=20

and began to beat Prepelicza till he was black and blue. Off he went to a d=
octor for a certificate as=20

to his wounds, and then to the barber, who had to write a long letter to th=
e king in his name,=20

complaining of the behavior of the two brothers Gregorics toward one of his=
 honest (?) subjects.=20

"If the king is not ashamed of them as subjects, I am not ashamed of owning=
 how I have been=20

beaten; they were two to one!"  Then he hired a cart (for it was impossible=
 for him to walk in his=20

present state), and drove to Varecska, where Mrs. Panyoki spent the summer,=
 and told her the=20

whole tale from beginning to end.  The result was the lawsuit Panyoki _vers=
us_ Gregorics, which=20

furnished the neighborhood with gossip for ten years. A whole legion of wit=
nesses had to be=20



examined, and the deeds and papers increased to such an extent that at the =
end they weighed=20

seventy-three pounds. Mrs. Panyoki could only prove the existence of the ca=
ldron, its having been=20

walled in, and its appropriation later on by the two brothers, who,=20


_
retreat advisable, he bounded off, followed by the excited hunters, as hard=
 as the horses could be=20

pressed. Having obtained a good start, we had gained upon him, and we kept =
up the pace until we=20

at length arrived within about eighty yards of the lion, who, although he a=
ppeared to fly easily=20

along like a cat, did not equal the speed of the horses. It was a beautiful=
 sight. Aggahr was an=20

exceedingly fast horse, and, having formerly belonged to one of tried to pr=
ove that it contained=20

nothing of value, only a number of rusty nails and odd bits of iron. As the=
 dead man had no lawyer=20

to defend him, _he_ lost the lawsuit, for it was certain he had played the =
trick on his relations, and=20

thus brought about the lawsuit, which only ended when it was all the same w=
hich side lost or won=20

it, for the seventy-three pounds of paper and the six lawyers had eaten up =
the whole of the=20

Gregorics and Panyoki fortunes.=20


_
gallop was perfection, and his long steady stride was as easy to himself as=
 to his rider; there was=20

no necessity to guide him, as he followed an animal like a greyhound, and s=
ailed between the=20

stems of the numerous trees, carefully avoiding their trunks, and choosing =
his route where the=20

branches allowed ample room for the rider to pass beneath. In about five mi=
nutes we had run the=20

lion straight across the plain, through several open strips of mimosas, and=
 we were now within a=20

few yards, hut unfortunately, just as Taher and Abou Do dashed forward in t=
he endeavour to ride=20

upon either flank, he sprang down a precipitous ravine, and disappeared in =
the thick thorns.  The=20

ravine formed a broad bottom, which, covered with dense family died in pove=
rty, and were=20

forgotten; only Pal Gregorics lived in the memories of the six lawyers, who=
 remarked from time to=20

time: "He was a clever man!"  But in spite of all researches, the dead man'=
s fortune was still=20

missing, not a trace of it was to be found, no one had inherited it except =
rumor, which did as it=20

liked with it, decreased it, increased it, placed it here or there at pleas=
ure.     Traces  PART III=20

CHAPTER I.  THE UMBRELLA AGAIN.   Many years passed, and things had changed=
 very much=20

in Besztercebanya, but the thing that will interest us most is the door-pla=
te on the house formerly=20

inhabited by old Gregorics, on which is to be read: "Gyoergy Wibra, lawyer.=
"  Yes, little Gyuri is=20
