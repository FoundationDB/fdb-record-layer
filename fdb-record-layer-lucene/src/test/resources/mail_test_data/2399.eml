stronger mentality dominated over his less resolute colleague. Martin-Roget=
--the fowler--was in his=20

turn caught in the net of a keener snarer than himself, and whilst--with th=
e obstinacy of the weak--

he was making mental resolutions to rebuke Chauvelin for his interference l=
ater on, he had already=20

fallen in with the latter's attitude.  "The wench has had three whole days =
wherein to alter her=20

present mood," he said more quietly, "and you know yourself, citizen, that =
the proconsul will not=20

wait after to-day."  "The day is young yet," rejoined Chauvelin. "It still =
hath six hours to its credit....=20

Six hours.... Three hundred and sixty minutes!" he continued with a pleasan=
t little laugh; "time=20

enough for a woman to change her mind three hundred and sixty times. Let me=
 advise you,=20

citizen, to leave the wench to her own meditations for the present, and I t=
rust that she will accept=20

the advice of a man who has a sincere regard for her beauty and her charms =
and who is old=20

enough to be her father, and seriously think the situation over in a concil=
iatory spirit. M. le duc de=20

Kernogan will be grateful to her, for of a truth he is not over happy eithe=
r at the moment ... and will=20

be still less happy in the depot to-morrow: it is over-crowded, and typhus,=
 I fear me, is rampant=20

among the prisoners. He has, I am convinced--in spite of what the citizenes=
s says to the contrary--

a rooted objection to being hurled into the Loire, or to be arraigned befor=
e the bar of the=20

Convention, not as an aristocrat and a traitor but as an unit of an undesir=
able herd of criminals=20

sent up to Paris for trial, by an anxious and harried proconsul. There! the=
re!" he added benignly,=20

"we will not worry our fair Yvonne any longer, will we, citizen? I think sh=
e has grasped the=20

alternative and will soon realise that marriage with an honourable patriot =
is not such an untoward=20

fate after all."  "And now, citizen Martin-Roget," he concluded, "I pray yo=
u allow me to take my=20

leave of the fair lady and to give you the wise recommendation to do likewi=
se. She will be far=20

better alone for awhile. Night brings good counsel, so they say."  He watch=
ed the girl keenly while=20

he spoke. Her impassivity had not deserted her for a single moment: but whe=
ther her calmness=20

was of hope or of despair he was unable to decide. On the whole he thought =
it must be the latter:=20

hope  "I will, if you like," said Billie; "if you'll only carry me up to th=
e garden gate and set me down,=20

I can easily walk up the path."  This proposal had just been agreed to when=
 the whole flotilla of=20

canoes paddled up alongside of the bank close under Prairie Cottage.  It wa=
s evening at the time.=20

The Davidson family was at supper, and as the canoes had approached very qu=
ietly, with Dan in=20

the leading one, no person stood on the bank to welcome them.  "It's as wel=
l they don't know,"=20

said Archie, jumping on shore.  "Now, Little Bill, come along, and I'll car=
ry you to the gate while=20

they're arranging matters for Dan."  Seated at the foot of the family table=
 was Peter Davidson.  He=20

could see the garden path through the window.  "Hallo! mother," he exclaime=
d, dropping his knife=20

and fork, "there is Little Bill or his ghost coming up the track."  "Imposs=
ible, Peter," said the good=20

lady, with, however, a look of anxiety which showed she believed that, or s=
omething else, to be=20

quite possible.  "Look for yourself, mother," cried Peter, springing up and=
 running out.  "It _is_=20

Billie," said Jessie, reflecting her mother's anxiety; "what can have broug=
ht them back so soon?"=20

Peter re-entered at the moment with Little Bill in his arms.  He set the bo=
y down and again ran out.=20

Taking the widow's trembling hand in both of his, Billie addressed her as "=
mother," like the rest of=20

the family.  "Dan has been hurt," he said, in his soft way, "and he's come =
home to get well.  They=20

will bring him up directly."  "Is he too ill to walk?" asked the widow.  "N=
o, not too ill--but too weak,"=20

answered the matter-of-fact Billie. "Indeed he is not ill at all, but he ha=
s lost a _heap_ of blood, for=20

they shot him."  Jessie waited to hear no more, but immediately followed Pe=
ter, and the small=20



servant Louise followed suit; leaving the widow in a half-fainting conditio=
n with the boy.  But she=20

did not remain long thus, for just then old Duncan McKay entered by the bac=
k-door.  "It will be bad=20

news you've been hearin', Mrs Davidson," he said, in some surprise, pouring=
 out a glass of water=20

as he spoke, and considerately handing it to the widow.  "Yes--O yes!  I've=
 just heard that Dan has=20

been shot."  "Bless my soul!" exclaimed the horrified old man, almost falli=
ng into a chair.  "Iss--iss=20

he tead?"  "No, thank God--only weak from loss of blood.  He'll be=20


_
purple-rimmed eyes, it would have brought moisture to the lips, a tremor to=
 the hand.  The Scarlet=20

Pimpernel was in Nantes--that fact was established beyond a doubt--but Chau=
velin had come to=20

the conclusion that so far as Yvonne Dewhurst herself was concerned, she kn=
ew nothing of the=20

mysterious agencies that were working on her behalf.  Chauvelin's hand clos=
ed with a nervous=20

contraction over the packet of papers in his pocket. Something of the secre=
t of that enigmatic=20

English adventurer lay revealed within its folds. Chauvelin had not yet had=
 the opportunity of=20

examining them: the interview with Yvonne had been the most important busin=
ess for the moment.=20

From somewhere in the distance a city clock struck six. The afternoon was w=
earing on. The=20

keenest brain in Europe was on the watch to drag one woman and one man from=
 the deadly trap=20

which had been so successfully set for them. A few hours more and Chauvelin=
 in his turn would be=20

pitting his wits against the resources of that  "That iss goot news--whatev=
er; for as long as there's=20

life there's hope."  Trying to comfort himself, as well as his friend, with=
 this truism, the old man=20

staggered out of the house in search of those who had gone before.  Soon a =
sad procession was=20

seen coming up the path, led by Archie.  Four men carried Dan on a rudely-e=
xtemporised litter.=20

His bloodless face and lips gave him the appearance of death, but the glow =
in his eyes told of still=20

unexhausted life.  "I'll be all right, mother," he said feebly, as they lai=
d him on his bed.  "I only want=20

food and rest.  Thank God--home at last!"  As he spoke, a quiet step was he=
ard, and Elspie, with a=20

face as pale as his own, knelt by his bedside and took his hand.  That touc=
h was the first impulse=20

the youth received towards decided recovery.  Old McKay perceived the chang=
e in his=20

countenance.  "Yes, yes! ay, ay!" he exclaimed, pacing violently up and dow=
n the room, "he wants=20

nothin' but victuals an' rest--steaks an' shops, and plenty o'=20
