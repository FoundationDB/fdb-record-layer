From this it     becomes manifest that the vernal equinox was once in the b=

om this it     becomes manifest that the vernal equinox was once in the beg=
inning     of Mula, and Mula was reckoned the first of the asterisms when  =
   they were twenty-eight in number, including  Mousqueton, groaning, slipp=
ed from his horse, his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle.  On perce=
iving the cavaliers, D'Artagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh; =
besides, his horse, he found, had a carbine on the bow of the saddle.  _
We thus see that the asterisms, twenty-seven in number, were     counted fr=
om the Mrigashirsha=20

when the vernal equinox was in its     beginning, and that the practice of =
thus counting was=20

adhered to     till the vernal equinox retrograded to the beginning of Krit=
tika,     when it became the=20

first of the asterisms. For then the winter     solstice had changed, reced=
ing from Phalguna=20

(February-March) to     Magha (January-February), one complete lunar month.=
 And, in like=20

manner, the place of Krittika was occupied by Ashvini, that is,     the lat=
ter became the first of the=20

asterisms, heading all others,     when its beginning coincided with the ve=
rnal equinoctial point,=20

or, in other words, when the winter solstice was in Pansha     (December-Fe=
bruary). Now from the=20

beginning of  "What would you have, my dear fellow? One doesn't hit the bul=
l's-eye every time; it is=20

something to hit inside the ring. Ho! parbleau! what is the matter with my =
horse?"  "Your horse is=20

falling," said Porthos, reining in his own.  In truth, the lieutenant's hor=
se stumbled and fell on his=20

knees; then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die. He h=
ad received in the chest=20

the bullet of D'Artagnan's first adversary. D'Artagnan swore loud enough to=
 be heard in the skies.=20

"Does your honor want a horse?" asked Mousqueton.  "Zounds! want one!" crie=
d the Gascon.=20

"Here's one, your honor----"  "How the devil hast thou two horses?" asked D=
'Artagnan, jumping on=20

one of them.  "Their masters are dead! I thought they might be useful, so I=
 took them."  Meantime=20

Porthos had reloaded his=20


_
Ashvini there are two asterisms, or 26-2/3 deg., and the time the     equin=
ox takes to retrograde=20

this distance at the rate of 1 in 72     years is 1920 years; and hence the=
 date at which the vernal=20

equinox coincided with the commencement of Ashvini or with the end     of R=
evati is 1920 - 1421 =3D=20

499 A.D.      BENTLEY'S OPINION.      12. The next and equally-important ob=
servation we have to=20

record     here is one discussed by Mr. Bentley in his researches into the =
    Indian antiquities. "The=20

first lunar asterism," he says, "in the     division of twenty-eight was ca=
lled Mula, that is to say, the=20

root     or origin. In the division of twenty-seven the first lunar     ast=
erism was called Jyeshtha, that=20

is to say, the eldest or first,     and consequently of the same  "Be on th=
e qui vive!" cried=20

D'Artagnan. "Here are two other cavaliers."  As he spoke, two horsemen adva=
nced at full speed.=20

"Ho! your honor!" cried Mousqueton, "the man you upset is getting up."  "Wh=
y didn't thou do as=20

thou didst to the first man?" said Porthos.  "I held the horses, my hands w=
ere full, your honor."  A=20

shot was fired that moment; Mousqueton shrieked with pain.  "Ah, sir! I'm h=
it in the other side!=20

exactly opposite the other! This hurt is just the fellow of the one I had o=
n the road to Amiens."=20

Porthos turned around like a lion, plunged on the dismounted cavalier, who =
tried to draw his=20

sword; but before it was out of the scabbard, Porthos, with the hilt of his=
 had struck him such a=20

terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butcher's kni=
fe.=20
