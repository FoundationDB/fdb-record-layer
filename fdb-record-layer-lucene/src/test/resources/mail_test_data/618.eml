Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Pr=
oject Gutenberg=20

Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporati=
on organized under the=20

laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Inter=
nal Revenue "No!  I=20

_not_ like him."  "I know that," returned the husband, setting down his mug=
 and resuming his pipe,=20

"but why?"  To this the lady answered with a sound too brief to spell, and =
the gentleman, being=20

accustomed to his wife's little eccentricities, broke into a hilarious laug=
h, and assured her that=20

Cloudbrow was not a bad fellow--a capital hunter and worthy of more regard =
than she was aware=20

of.  "For," said he, "Cloudbrow is willing to wait till spring for payment =
of the horse an' cart I hired=20

from him last year.  You know that I could not pay him till I go to the pla=
ins an' get another load of=20

meat an' leather.  You will go with me, Slowfoot, an' we will have grand ti=
mes of it with buffalo-

humps an' marrow bones, an' tea an' tobacco.  Ah! it makes my mouth water. =
 Give me more tea.=20



So.  That will do.  What a noise the wind makes!  I hopes it won't blow ove=
r the shed an' kill the=20

horse.  But if it do I cannot help that.  Cloudbrow could not ask me to pay=
 for what the wind does."=20

There came another gust of such violence, as he spoke, that even Slowfoot's=
 benignant=20

expression changed to a momentary glance of anxiety, for the shingles on th=
e roof rattled, and the=20

rafters creaked as if the hut were groaning under the strain.  It passed, h=
owever, and the pair went=20

on smoking with placid contentment, for they had but recently had a "square=
" meal of pemmican=20

and flour.  This compost when cooked in a frying-pan is exceedingly rich an=
d satisfying--not to say=20

heavy--food, but it does not incommode such as La Certe and his wife.  It e=
ven made the latter=20

feel amiably disposed to Cloudbrow.  This _sobriquet_ had been given by the=
 half-breeds to a=20

young Scotch settler named Duncan McKay, in consequence of the dark frown w=
hich had settled=20

habitually on his brow--the result of bad temper and unbridled passion.  He=
 was younger brother to=20

that Fergus who has already been introduced to the reader.  Having been par=
tially trained, while in=20

Scotland, away from the small farm-house of his father, and having received=
 a better education,=20

Duncan conceived himself to stand on a higher level than the sedate and une=
ducated Fergus.=20

Thus pride was added to his bad temper.  But he was not altogether destitut=
e of good points.=20

What man is?  One of these was a certain reckless open-handedness, so that =
he was easily=20

imposed on by the protestations and assurances of the sly, plausible, and l=
azy La Certe.  The=20

couple were still engaged in smoking, quaffing tea, and other intellectual =
pursuits, when they=20

heard sounds outside as of some one approaching.  Another moment, and the d=
oor burst open,=20

and a man in white stepped in.  He saluted them with a familiar and hasty "=
_bonjour_," as he=20

stamped and beat the snow vigorously from his garments.  "What?  Antoine De=
champ!" exclaimed=20

La Certe, rising slowly to welcome his friend; "you seem in hurry?"  "Ay--i=
n great hurry!  They are=20

starving on the plains!  Many are dead! Davidson has come in!  He is more t=
han half-dead!  Can=20

hardly tell the news!  Drops asleep when he is speaking!  Luckily I met him=
 when going home in=20

 would pilot Davidson=20

obvious impatience at the delay caused by having so much to tell.  "Is your=
 horse in the stable?"=20

Executive and Director     his friend began, with exasperating composure, t=

was, but that the horse was not his.  "Cloudbrow is its owner," he said, "a=

happens to it he will ---.  Stay, I will get you lantern--"  He stopped, fo=
r Dechamp, observing a large=20

key hanging on the wall, had seized it and rushed out of the hut without wa=
iting for a lantern.=20

"Strange, how easy some men get into a fuss!"=20
