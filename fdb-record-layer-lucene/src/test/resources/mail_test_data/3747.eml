"A bill?" repeated Honora.  "A bill of divorce," explained Mrs. Mayo.  Hono=
ra was conscious of=20

conflicting emotions: astonishment, resentment, and--most curiously--of rel=
ief that the little woman=20

knew it.  "Yes," she answered.  But Mrs. Mayo did not appear to notice or r=
esent her brevity.  "I=20

took a fancy to you the minute I saw you," she said. "I can't say as much f=
or the other Easterner=20

that was here last year. But I made up my mind that it must be a mighty mea=
n man who would=20

treat you badly."  Honora stood as though rooted to the pavement. She found=
 a reply impossible.=20

"When I think of my luck," her neighbour continued, "I'm almost ashamed. We=
 were married on=20

fifteen dollars a week. Of course there have been trials, we must always ex=
pect that; and we've=20

had to work hard, but--it hasn't hurt us." She paused and looked up at Hono=
ra, and added=20

contritely: "There! I shouldn't have said anything. It's mean of me to talk=
 of my happiness. I'll drop=20

in some afternoon--if you'll let me --when I get through my work," said the=
 little woman.  "I wish you=20

would," replied Honora.  She had much to think of on her walk that morning,=
 and new resolutions=20

to make. Here was happiness growing and thriving, so far as she could see, =
without any of that=20

rarer nourishment she had once thought so necessary. And she had come two t=
housand miles to=20

behold it.  She walked many miles, as a part of the regimen and discipline =
to which not be able to=20

serve her. Some devilish plot has been invented, and we must meet it. Phoeb=
e, by her actions last=20

night and this morning, even by the state in which she now lies, unfortunat=
ely gives some colour to=20

the vile, infernal accusation. Everything depends upon coolness. Such stran=
ge cases are being=20

daily brought to light that the public are ready to believe anything. Now t=
ell me: what was Phoebe's=20

motive in leaving last night for Parksides without first letting you know?"=
  "I can only guess at it,=20

Fred; but I am sure it is the truth. We were in the most dreadful trouble--=
I thought nothing worse=20

could happen to us, but I was mistaken; this is a thousand times more terri=
ble!"  "Don't give way,=20

Aunt Leth. Remember what I said: everything depends upon coolness. I know o=
f your trouble, and=20

that you are, thank God! out of it; it was a money trouble, and the money i=
s paid."  "Yes, Fred; but=20

how did you know?"  "Never mind; go on about Phoebe."  "We were sitting in =
the dark, talking and=20

mourning over it. My husband was in despair. There was only one way to prev=
ent ruin, and that=20

was to obtain a sum of money at once--it was three hundred pounds, Fred; a =
fortune--and we saw=20

no way. So we sat talking, and trying to console each other. Suddenly I mis=
sed Phoebe; she had=20

left the room so quietly that we did not observe it. A little while afterwa=
rd 'Melia Jane told us that=20

she had met Phoebe, who had given her a=20


_
she had set herself. Her haunting horror in this place, as she thought of t=
he colony of which Mr.=20

Beckwith had spoken and of Mrs. Boutwell's row of French novels, was degene=
ration. She was=20

resolved to return to Chiltern a better and a wiser and a truer woman, unst=
ained by the ordeal. At=20

the outskirts of the town she halted by the river's bank, breathing deeply =
of the pure air of the vast=20

plains that surrounded her.  She was seated that afternoon at her desk in t=
he sitting-room upstairs=20

when she heard the tinkle of the door-bell, and remembered her neighbour's =
promise to call. With=20

something of a pang she pushed back her chair. Since the episode of the mor=
ning, the friendship=20

of the little woman had grown to have a definite value; for it was no small=
 thing, in Honora's=20

situation, to feel the presence of a warm heart next door. All day she had =
been thinking of Mrs.=20

Mayo and her strange happiness, and longing to talk with her again, and dre=
ading it. And while=20

she was bracing herself for the trial Mathilde entered with a card.  "Tell =
Mrs. Mayo I shall be down=20

in a minute," she said.  It was not a lady, Mathilde replied, but a monsieu=
r.  Honora took the card.=20

For a long time she sat staring at it, while Mathilde waited. It read:     =
          Mr. Peter Erwin.=20

"Madame will see monsieur?"  A great sculptor once said to the statesman wh=
o was to be his=20

model: "Wear your old coat. There is as much of a man in the back of his ol=
d coat, I think, as there=20

is in his face." As Honora halted on the threshold, Peter was standing look=
ing out of the five-foot=20

plate-glass window, and his back was to her.  She was suddenly stricken. No=
t since she had been=20

a child, not even in the weeks just passed, had she felt that pain. And as =
a child, self-pity seized=20

her--as a lost child, when darkness is setting in, and the will fails and d=
istance appalls. Scalding=20

tears welled into her eyes as she seized the frame of the door, but it must=
 have been her breathing=20

that he heard. He turned and crossed the room to her as she had known he wo=
uld, and she clung=20

to him as she had so often done in days gone by when, hurt and bruised, he =
had rescued and=20

soothed her. For the moment, the delusion that his power was still limitles=
s prevailed, and her faith=20

whole again, so many times had he mended a world all awry.  He led her to t=
he window-seat and=20

gently disengaged her hands from his shoulders and took one of them and hel=
d it between his=20

own. He did not speak, for his was a rare intuition; and gradually her hand=
 ceased to tremble, and=20

the uncontrollable sobs that shook her became less frequent.  "Why did you =
come? Why did you=20

come?" she cried.  "To see you, Honora."  "But you might have--warned me." =
 "Yes," he said, "it's=20

true, I might."  She drew her hand away, and gazed steadfastly at his face.=
  "Why aren't you=20

angry?" she said. "You don't believe in what I have done--you don't sympath=
ize with it--you don't=20

understand it."  "I have come here to try," he said.  She shook her head.  =
"You can't--you can't--

you never could."  "Perhaps," he answered, "it may not be so difficult as y=
ou think."  Grown=20

calmer, she considered this. What did he mean by it? to imply a knowledge o=
f herself?  "It will be=20

useless," she said inconsequently.  "No," he said, "it will not be useless.=
"  She considered this=20

also, and took the broader meaning that such acts are not wasted.  "What do=
 you intend to try to=20

do?" she asked.  He smiled a little.  "To listen to as much as you care to =
tell me, Honora."  She=20

looked at him again, and an errant thought slipped in between her larger an=
xieties. Wherever he=20

went, how extraordinarily he seemed to harmonize with his surroundings. At =
Silverdale, and in the=20

drawing-room of the New York house, and in the little parlour in this far w=
estern town. What was=20

it? His permanence? Was it his power? She felt that, but it was a strange k=
ind of power--not like=20

other men's. She felt, as she sat there beside him, that his was a power mo=
re difficult to combat.=20

That to defeat it was at once to make it stronger, and to grow weaker. She =
summoned her pride,=20



she summoned her wrongs: she summoned the ego which had winged its triumpha=
nt flight far=20

above his kindly, disapproving eye. He had the ability to make her taste de=
feat in the very hour of=20

victory. And she knew that, when she fell, he would be there in his strengt=
h to lift her up.  "Did--did=20

they tell you to come?" she asked.  "There was no question of that, Honora.=
 I was away when--

when they learned you were here. As soon had gone to Parksides to see her f=
ather. There was=20

but one reason for her doing this; it was to try and obtain the money from =
her father that would=20

prevent us being turned into the streets. She must have left us just as my =
husband was saying that=20

as he walked to the bank he had a dream of hope, and that an angel had come=
 forward to save=20

us. Then, I suppose, the idea occurred to our dear girl to go to her father=
 and entreat him to help=20

us. If she had spoken to me first, I should have convinced her of the impos=
sibility of her errand=20

meeting with success."  "You have placed the right construction upon her le=
aving unknown to you.=20

She felt that if you suspected her intention she would be unable to carry i=
t out. When you put her=20

to bed this morning did you search her pockets?"  "Yes, Fred; and I hoped t=
o find something that=20

would clear up the mystery. I found nothing."  "You found something," said =
Fred. "Her=20

handkerchief, her purse?"  "Yes, of course, those; and her gloves."  "She w=
as not wearing them,=20

then?"  "No."  "Was there any money in her purse?"  "Not one penny, Fred." =
 "I hear 'Melia Jane's=20

step on the stairs; I must have a word with her." He went to the door and c=
alled the girl, who=20

entered the room. "I want to ask you a question or two," he said to her. "I=
n answering me do not=20

say a word you are not certain of."  "I won't, Mr. Cornwall," said 'Melia J=
ane.  "When you met Miss=20

Phoebe last night did she seem very much agitated?"  "Very much, Mr. Cornwa=
ll. More nor I can=20

express. She was crying, but she didn't want me to see. She tried to keep h=
er face from me."=20

"You did not attempt to stop her? You asked her no questions?"  "Lor', Mr. =
Cornwall, she didn't=20

give me time to get out a single word! She said what she had got to say, an=
d she ran away like=20

lightning."  "Did she wear a veil?"  "Yes, Mr. Cornwall, she did. The veil =
that man as come 'ere this=20

afternoon showed me, and arksed me whether Miss Phoebe wore it last night w=
hen she went=20

away. 'Owever he got 'old of it is more than I can guess."  "When he asked =
you whether Miss=20

Phoebe wore the veil, what did you say?"  "I sed, yes, she did. And he show=
ed me a brooch, and=20

wanted to git me to say that she wore that last night; but I didn't, becaus=
e I ain't seen that brooch=20

on Miss Phoebe for a long time."  "You could swear," said Fred, eagerly, "t=
hat she did not wear a=20

brooch when you saw her last night?"  "No, Mr. Cornwall, I couldn't swear t=
hat. I could swear I=20

didn't see it--that's all. But I could swear to the veil."  Fred bit his li=
p. "If any man you don't know=20

asks you any further questions about Miss Phoebe, do not answer him."  "I w=
on't, Mr. Cornwall;=20

they sha'n't pump me. That feller tried to, but he didn't git very much."  =
"He got enough," thought=20

Fred, and said aloud, "That will do, 'Melia Jane; you can go. And now, Aunt=
 Leth, quite apart from=20

the statement which Mrs. Pamflett gave the reporters, it is proved that Pho=
ebe was at Parksides=20

last night. How did she get there?"  "I really can't say, Fred. I think she=
 must have been too late for=20

the last train."  "Have you an 'A B C' in the house?"  "No."  "I must see a=
t what time the last train=20

starts. Do you think she came back to London by the train this morning?"  "=
I don't know, Fred.=20

Poor child! her feet were very much blistered."  "Good God! Surely she coul=
d not have walked!"=20

He paced the room in great excitement. "About the brooch, Aunt Leth? Can yo=
u fix any definite=20

time--any particular day--on which you last saw it in Phoebe's possession?"=
  "No, Fred; but I am=20

sure I haven't seen it for a good many weeks."  "That she has not worn it f=
or a good many weeks?"=20



"Not to my knowledge."  "You could not swear she has not worn it?"  "No."  =
"You could not swear=20

she did not wear it last night?"  "No. But it is scarcely likely, with her =
feelings toward that wretch=20

Mrs. Pamflett, that she would ever wear it after she was turned out of her =
father's house. What I=20

am saying seems to trouble you."  "It does trouble me. I pray that I may be=
 wrong in my=20

impressions, but I fear that dark days are before us."  "If we speak the tr=
uth, Fred, there is nothing=20

to fear."  "I am not so sure," said Fred, gloomily.  "But we _must_ speak t=
he truth, Fred!"  "Yes; it=20

must be spoken--by us at least."  "Your fears may be groundless, Fred."  "I=
 am afraid not."  "All we=20

can do is to hope for the best."  "Not at all, Aunt Leth. What we have to d=
o is to work for the best.=20

Hoping never yet overcame a villainous plot. I must go now. There is much t=
o do. I=20


_
"Tell me how they feel," she said, in a low voice.  "They think only of you=
. And the thought that you=20

are unhappy overshadows all others. They believe that it is to them you sho=
uld have come, if you=20

were in trouble instead of coming here."  "How could I?" she cried. "How ca=
n you ask? That is=20

what makes it so hard, that I cannot be with them now. But I should only ha=
ve made them still=20

more unhappy, if I had gone. They would not have understood--they cannot un=
derstand who have=20

every reason to believe in marriage, why those to whom it has been a mocker=
y and a torture=20

should be driven to divorce."  "Why divorce?" he said.  "Do you mean--do yo=
u mean that you wish=20

me to give you the reasons why I felt justified in leaving my husband?"  "N=
ot unless you care to,"=20

he replied. "I have no right to demand them. I only ask you to remember, Ho=
nora, that you have=20

not explained these reasons very clearly in your letters to your aunt and u=
ncle. They do not=20

understand them. Your uncle was unable, on many accounts, to come here; and=
 he thought that--

that as an old friend, you might be willing to talk to me."  "I can't live =
with--with my husband," she=20

cried. "I don't love him, and he doesn't love me. He doesn't know what love=
 is."  Peter Erwin=20

glanced at her, but she was too absorbed then to see the thing in his eyes.=
 He made no comment.=20

"We haven't the same tastes, nor--nor the same way of looking at things --t=
he same views about=20

making money--for instance. We became absolute strangers. What more is ther=
e to say?" she=20

added, a little defiantly.  "Your husband committed no--flagrant offence ag=
ainst you?" he inquired.=20

"That would have made him human, at least," she cried. "It would have prove=
d that he could feel--

something. No, all he cares for in the     CHAPTER X.  THE INQUEST.   The f=
ollowing report of=20

the inquest appeared in the special editions of the evening papers on the f=
ollowing evening:  "The=20

inquest upon the body of the gentleman known as 'Miser' Farebrother, who wa=
s found dead in the=20

grounds of Parksides, was held in Beddington this morning.  "The coroner, a=
ddressing the jury,=20

said that they were about to investigate what there was little reason to do=
ubt was a foul murder.=20

Certain witnesses were present whose evidence would enable them to decide u=
nder what=20

circumstances death had taken place. He was informed that one witness was a=
bsent whose=20

evidence might have an important bearing upon the inquiry, although it woul=
d not probably alter=20

the verdict which would be given. Their first duty was to identify the body=
 of the dead man.  "This=20

being done, the actual inquiry commenced. The first witness called was Mrs.=
 Deborah Pamflett.=20

Before she was examined, however, Mr. Frederick Cornwall, barrister, rose, =
and asked to be=20

allowed to say a few words.  "The Coroner: 'Have they any bearing upon this=
 inquiry?'  "Mr.=20

Cornwall: 'A direct bearing. I appear here to watch the case on behalf of t=
he only child of the=20

murdered man, and I request permission to put some questions to the witness=
es, if I consider it=20

necessary to do so.'  "The Coroner: 'I shall have no objection to pertinent=
 questions being put to=20

the witnesses, but it must be done through me.'  "Mr. Cornwall: 'I thank yo=
u, sir. You have referred=20

to the absence of a witness whose evidence would be likely to have an impor=
tant bearing upon=20

this inquiry. I assume that the witness referred to is the lady I represent=
. An unhappy circumstance=20

prevents her attendance. I hand you a certificate, signed by two doctors, t=
o the effect that=20


_
is to make money, and he doesn't care how he makes it. No woman with an ato=
m of soul can live=20

with a man like that."  If Peter Erwin deemed this statement a trifle revol=
utionary, he did not say so.=20

"So you just--left him," he said.  "Yes," said Honora. "He didn't care. He =
was rather relieved than=20

otherwise. If I had lived with him till I died, I couldn't have made him ha=
ppy."  "You tried, and=20

failed," said Peter.  She flushed.  "I couldn't have made him happier," she=
 declared, correcting=20

herself. "He has no conception of is suffering from brain-fever, and that s=
he is not in a fit state to=20

be removed from the house in which she is lying, or to be examined either t=
here or here. Were she=20

well enough she would be present on this occasion, painful as it would be t=
o her.'  "The Coroner:=20

'In whose house is Miss Farebrother being nursed?'  "Mr. Cornwall: 'In her =
aunt's house in=20

Camden Town. You will find the exact address on the certificate.'  "The cer=
tificate was handed in,=20

and the examination of Mrs. Pamflett was proceeded with.  "'Your name is=20
