dracaena marginata other in every feature. We make no difficulty to recognizing them as the same precious pair whom Outlaw Dick captured from the stage, only to lose them again through the personality; that it was always ready to recognize and follow a leader, provided, of course, that the qualities of leadership were demonstrated.  He felt the time had come--the dracaena marginata other in every feature. We make no difficulty to recognizing them as the same precious pair whom Outlaw Dick captured from the stage, only to lose them again through the personality; that it was always ready to recognize and follow a leader, provided, of course, that the qualities of leadership were demonstrated.  He felt the time had come--the _
nonchalance which was not assumed.  "Good-evening!" he said, tipping his sombrero, but taking 

care not to let the mask slip from his face. "I hope mine is not an intrusion. Hearing music, I was 

loth to stay away, for I am a great lover of music;--it is the one passion that appeals to my better 

nature."  He seated himself on the little stone step, and motioned for Redburn to proceed.  One of 

those inside the cabin had been strangely affected at the sight of Dick, and that person was Anita. 

She turned deathly pale, her eyes assumed an expression of affright, and she trembled violently, 

as she first saw him. The Prince of the Road, however, if he saw her, noticed not her agitation; in 

fact, he took not the second glance at her while he remained at the cabin. His eyes were almost 

constantly fastening upon the lovely face and form of Alice.  Thinking it best to humor one who 

might become either a powerful enemy or an influential friend, Redburn accordingly struck up a 

lively air, _a la banjo_, and in exact imitation of a minstrel, rendered "Gwine to Get a Home, 

Bymeby." And the thunders of _encore_ that came from the outside listeners, showed how surely 

he had touched upon a pleasant chord. He followed that with several modern serio-comic songs, 

all of which were received well and heartily applauded.  "That recalls memories of good old times," 

said the road-agent, as he leaned back against the door-sill, and gazed at the mountains, grand, 

majestic, stupendous, and the starlit sky, azure, calm and serene. "Recalls the days of early 

boyhood, that were gay, pure, and happy. Ah! ho!"  He heaved a deep sign, and his head dropped 

upon his breast.  A deathlike silence pervaded the cabin; that one heartfelt sigh aroused a 

sensation of pity in each of the four hearts that beat within the cabin walls.  That the road-agent 

was a gentleman in disguise, was not to be gainsayed; all felt that, despite his outlawed calling, he 

was deserving of a place among them, in his better moods.  As if to accord with his mood, Alice 

began a sweet birdlike song, full of tender pathos, and of quieting sympathy.  It was a quaint 

Scottish melody,--rich in its honeyed meaning, sweetly weird and pitiful; wonderfully soothing and 

nourishing to a weeping spirit.  Clear and flute-like the maiden's cultured voice swelled out on the 

still night air, and the mountain echoes caught up the strains and lent a wild peculiar 

accompaniment.  Deadwood Dick listened, with his head still bowed, and his hands clasped about 

one knee;--listened in a kind of fascination, until the last reverberations of the song had died out in 

a wailing echo; then he sprung abruptly to his feet, drew one hand wearily across the masked 

brow; raised his sombrero with a deft movement, and bowed himself out--out into the night, where 

the moon and stars looked down at him, perhaps with more lenience than on some.  Alice Terry 

rose from her seat, crossed over to the door, and gazed after the straight handsome form, until it 

had mingled with the other road-agents, who had camped upon the slope. Then she turned about, 

and sat down on the couch beside Anita.  "You are still, dear," she said, stroking the other's long, 

unconfined hair. "Are you lonely? If not why don't you say something?"  "I have nothing to say," 

replied Anita, a sad, sweet smile playing over her features. "I have been too much taken up with 

the music to think of talking."  "But, you are seldom talkative."  "So brother used to tell me. He said 

I had lost my heart, and tongue."  Redburn was drumming on the window-casing with his fingers;--

a sort of lonely tattoo it was.  "You seemed to be much interested in the outlaw. Miss Terry," he 

observed, as if by chance the thought had just occurred to him, when, in reality, he was downright 

jealous. "Had you two ever met--"  "Certainly not, sir," and Alice flashed him an inquiring glance. 

"Why do you ask?"  "Oh! for no reason, in particular, only I fancied that song was meant especially 

for him."  Redburn, afterward, would have given a hundred dollars to have recalled those words, 



for the haughty, half-indignant look Alice gave him instantly showed him he was on the wrong 

track.  If he wished to court her favor, it must be in a different way, and he must not again give her 

a glimpse of his jealous nature.  "You spoke of a brother," said Alice, turning to Anita. "Does he 

live here with you?"  "Yes, when not away on business. He has now been absent for over a 

month."  "Indeed! Is he as sweet, sad, and silent as yourself?"  "Oh! no; Ned is unlike me; he is 

buoyant, cheerful, pleasant."  "Ned? What is his full name, dear?"  "Edward Harris."  Alice grew 

suddenly pale and speechless, as she remembered the handsome young miner whom Fearless 

Frank had slain in the duel, just outside of Deadwood. This, then, was his sister; and evidently she 

as yet knew nothing of his sad fate.  "Do you know aught concerning Edward Harris?" Redburn 

The Philadelphia publisher then deftly went on, explained editorial conditions in his magazine, and, 

recognizing the ethics of the occasion by not offering Bok another position while he was already 

occupying one, asked him if he knew the man for the place.  "Are you talking at me or through 

me?" asked Bok.  "Both," replied Mr. Curtis.  This was in April of 1889.  Bok promised Mr. Curtis 

he would look over the field, and meanwhile he sent over to Philadelphia the promised trial 

"literary gossip" instalment.  It pleased Mr. Curtis, who suggested a monthly department, to which 

Bok consented.  He also turned over in his mind the wisdom of interrupting his line of progress 

with the Scribners, and in New York, and began to contemplate the possibilities in Philadelphia 

and the work there.  He gathered a collection of domestic magazines then published, and looked 

them over to see what was already in the field.  Then he began to study himself, his capacity for 

the work, and the possibility of finding it congenial.  He realized that it was absolutely foreign to his 

Scribner work; that it meant a radical departure.  But his work with his newspaper syndicate 

naturally occurred to him, and he studied it with a view of its adaptation to the field of the 

Philadelphia magazine.  His next step was to take into his confidence two or three friends whose 

judgment he trusted and discuss the possible change.  Without an exception, they advised against 

it.  The periodical had no standing, they argued; Bok would be out of sympathy with its general 

atmosphere after his Scribner environment; he was now in the direct line of progress in New York 

publishing houses; and, to cap the climax, they each argued in turn, he would be buried in 

Philadelphia: New York was the centre, etc., etc.  More than any other single argument, this last 

point destroyed Bok's faith in the judgment of his friends.  He had had experience enough to 

realize that a man could not be buried in any city, provided he had the ability to stand out from his 

fellow-men.  He knew from his biographical reading that cream will rise to the surface anywhere, in 

Philadelphia as well as in New York: it all depended on whether the cream was there: it was up to 

the man.  Had he within him that peculiar, subtle something that, for the want of a better phrase, 

we call the editorial instinct?  That was all there was to it, and that decision had to be his and his 

alone!  A business trip for the Scribners now calling him West, Bok decided to stop at Philadelphia, 

have a talk with Mr. Curtis, and look over his business plant.  He did this, and found Mr. Curtis 

even more desirous than before to have him consider the position.  Bok's instinct was strongly in 

favor of an acceptance.  A natural impulse moved him, without reasoning, to action.  Reasoning 

led only to a cautious mental state, and caution is a strong factor in the Dutch character.  The 

longer he pursued a conscious process of reasoning, the farther he got from the position.  But the 

instinct remained strong.  On his way back from the West, he stopped in Philadelphia again to 

consult his friend, George W. Childs; and here he found the only person who was ready to 



encourage him to make the change.  Bok now laid the matter before his mother, in whose feminine 

instinct he had supreme confidence.  With her, he met with instant discouragement.  But in 

subsequent talks he found that her opposition was based not upon the possibilities inherent in the 

position, but on a mother's natural disinclination to be separated from one of her sons. In the case 

of Fanny Davenport's offer the mother's instinct was strong against the proposition itself.  But in 

the present instance it was the mother's love that was speaking; not her instinct or judgment.  Bok 

now consulted his business associates, and, to a man, they discouraged the step, but almost 

invariably upon the argument that it was suicidal to leave New York.  He had now a glimpse of the 

truth that there is no man so provincially narrow as the untravelled New Yorker who believes in his 

heart that the sun rises in the East River and sets in the North River.  He realized more keenly 

than ever before that the decision rested with him alone.  On September 1, 1889, Bok wrote to Mr. 

Curtis, accepting the position in Philadelphia; and on October 13 following he left the Scribners, 

where he had been so fortunate and so happy, and, after a week's vacation, followed where his 

instinct so strongly led, but where his reason wavered.  On October 20, 1889, Edward Bok 

became the editor of _The Ladies' Home Journal_.     CHAPTER XII  SUCCESSFUL 

EDITORSHIP  There is a popular notion that the editor of a woman's magazine should be a 

woman.  At first thought, perhaps, this sounds logical.  But it is a curious fact that by far the larger 

number of periodicals for women, the world over, are edited by men; and where, as in some 

cases, a woman is the 


_
her agitation. Alice considered a moment.  "I do," she answered, at last. "This Fearless Frank, 

whom I came here with, had a duel with a man, just above Deadwood, whose name was Edward 

Harris!"  "My God;--and his fate--?"  "He was instantly killed, and left lying where he dropped!" 

There was a scream of agony, just here, and a heavy fall.  Anita had fainted!     CHAPTER XIV. 

THE TRANSIENT TRIUMPH.   Redburn sprung from his seat, ran over to her side, and raised her 

tenderly in his arms.  "Poor thing!" he murmured, gazing into her pale, still face, "the shock was 

too much for her. No wonder she fainted." He laid her on the couch, and kept off the others who 

crowded around.  "Bring cold water!" he ordered, "and I will soon have her out of this fit."  Alice 

hastened to obey, and Anita's face and hands were bathed in the cooling liquid until she began to 

show signs of returning consciousness.  "You may now give me the particulars of the affair," 

Redburn said, rising and closing the door, for a chilly breeze was sweeping into the cabin.  Alice 

proceeded to comply with his request by narrating what had occurred and, as nearly as possible, 

what had been said. When she had concluded, he gazed down for several moments thoughtfully 

into the face of Anita. There was much yet that was beyond his powers of comprehension--a 

knotty problem for which he saw no immediate solution.  "What do you think about it, "General"?" 

he asked, turning to the mine-locater. "Have we sufficient evidence to hang this devil in scarlet?" 

"Hardly, boyee, hardly. 'Peers te me, 'cordin' to ther gal's tell, thet thar war a fair shake all around, 

an' as duelin' ar' more or less ther fashun 'round these parts,--considera'bly more o' less 'n less o' 

more--et ain't law-fell ter yank a critter up by ther throat!"  "I know it is not, according to the 

customs of this country of the Black Hills; but, look at it. That fellow, who I am satisfied is a black-

hearted knave, has not only taken the life of poor Harris, but, very probably, has given his sister 

her death-blow. The question is: should he go unpunished in the face of all this evidence?"  "Yes. 

Let him go; _I_ will be the one to punish him!"  It was Anita who spoke. She had partly arisen on 

the couch; her face was streaked with water and slightly haggard; her hair blew unconfined about 

her neck and shoulders; her eyes blazed with a wild, almost savage fire.         *       *       generally 

in the hands of a man, or group of men, in the background. Why this is so has never been 

explained, any more than why the majority of women's dressmakers are men; why music, with its 

larger appeal to women, has been and is still being composed, largely, by men, and why its 

greatest instrumental performers are likewise men; and why the church, with its larger 

membership of women, still has, as it always has had, men for its greatest preachers.  In fact, we 

may well ponder whether the full editorial authority and direction of a modern magazine, either 

essentially feminine in its appeal or not, can safely be entrusted to a woman when one considers 

how largely executive is the nature of such a position, and how thoroughly sensitive the modern 

editor must be to the hundred and one practical business matters which to-day enter into and form 

so large a part of the editorial duties.  We may question whether women have as yet had sufficient 

experience in the world of business to cope successfully with the material questions of a pivotal 

editorial position.  Then, again, it is absolutely essential in the conduct of a magazine with a 

feminine or home appeal to have on the editorial staff women who are experts in their line; and the 

truth is that women will work infinitely better under the direction of a man than of a woman.  It 

would seem from the present outlook that, for some time, at least, the so-called woman's 

magazine of large purpose and wide vision is very likely to be edited by a man.  It is a question, 

however, whether the day of the woman's magazine, as we have known it, is not passing. Already 



the day has gone for the woman's magazine built on the old lines which now seem so grotesque 

and feeble in the light of modern growth.  The interests of women and of men are being brought 

closer with the years, and it will not be long before they will entirely merge.  This means a 

constantly diminishing necessity for the distinctly feminine magazine.  Naturally, there will always 

be a field in the essentially feminine pursuits which have no place in the life of a man, but these 

are rapidly being cared for by books, gratuitously distributed, issued by the manufacturers of 

distinctly feminine and domestic wares; for such publications the best talent is being employed, 

and the results are placed within easy access of women, by means of newspaper advertisement, 

the store-counter, or the mails. 


_
"Let him go!" she repeated, more of fierceness in her voice than Redburn had ever heard there, 

before. "He shall not escape my vengeance. Oh, my poor, poor dead brother!"  She flung herself 

back upon the couch, and gave herself up to a wild, passionate, uncontrollable outburst of tears 

and sobs--the wailings of a sorrowing heart. For a long time she continued to weep and sob 

violently; then came a lull, during which she fell asleep, from exhaustion--a deep sleep. Redburn 

and Alice then carried her into an adjoining room, where she was left under the latter's skillful care. 

Awhile later the cabin was wrapped in silence.  When morning sunlight next peeped down into the 

Flower Pocket, it found everything generally astir. Anita was up and pursuing her household 

duties, but she was calm, now, even sadder than before, making a strange contrast to blithe, 

gaysome Alice, who flitted about, here and there, like some bright-winged butterfly surrounded by 

a halo of later--and much sooner than later--supplant the practical portions of the woman's 

magazine, leaving only the general contents, which are equally interesting to men and to women. 

Hence the field for the magazine with the essentially feminine appeal is contracting rather than 

broadening, and it is likely to contract much more rapidly in the future.  The field was altogether 

different when Edward Bok entered it in 1889. It was not only wide open, but fairly crying out to be 

filled.  The day of _Godey's Lady's Book_ had passed; _Peterson's Magazine_ was breathing its 

last; and the home or women's magazines that had attempted to take their place were sorry 

affairs.  It was this consciousness of a void ready to be filled that made the Philadelphia 

experiment so attractive to the embryo editor.  He looked over the field and reasoned that if such 

magazines as did exist could be fairly successful, if women were ready to buy such, how much 

greater response would there be 


_
*       *       *       *       *  Unknown to any one save themselves, two men were within the valley of 

the Flower Pocket gold-mines--there on business, and that business meant bloodshed. They were 

secreted in among the foothills on the western side of the flowering paradise, at a point where they 

were not observed, and at the same time were the observers of all that was going on in front of 

them.  How came they here, when the initiative--a magazine that would be an authoritative 

clearing-house for all the problems confronting women in the home, that brought itself closely into 

contact with those problems and tried to solve them in an entertaining and efficient way; and yet a 

magazine of uplift and inspiration: a magazine, in other words, that would give light and leading in 

the woman's world.  The method of editorial expression in the magazines of 1889 was 


_
accessible entrance there was to the valley? The answer was: they came secretly through the 

pass on the night preceding the arrival of the road-agents, and had been lying in close 

concealment ever since.  The one was an elderly man of portly figure, and the other a young, 

dandyish fellow, evidently the elder's son, for they resembled distinctly vague and prohibitively 

impersonal.  The public knew the name of scarcely a single editor of a magazine; there was no 

personality that stood out in the mind: the accepted editorial expression was the indefinite "we"; no 

one ventured to use the first person singular and talk intimately to the reader.  Edward Bok's
