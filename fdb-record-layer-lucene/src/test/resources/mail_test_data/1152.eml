sickened me. The colonel said: "That's the 'Archie' in Bedford House. I think the last 'crump' got it. 

You two"--indicating myself and another officer--"go up and see if we can do anything. See if they 

want a working party and let me know."  We started to run. On the way up I looked into the cellars 

to see the men whom I, the minute previously, had mourned for, and found two asleep, three 

hunting through their shirts, and the rest breaking the army orders by "shooting craps." From 

Bedford House a long trail of smoke was rising and the explosions became louder. We suddenly 

discovered the "Archie" in flames. It was in the courtyard and for camouflage had been covered 

with branches. It was mounted on an armored Pierce-Arrow truck. The "crump" had hit it, and 

gasoline, paint, branches, seen. Banks of white sand, resembling the siliceous particles of the 

seashore, are noticed on the mountain tops, containing masses of compact, heavy ferruginous 

sandstone, similar to the rocks of our alluvial seaboard. Large beds of water-worn siliceous 

pebbles, in no way differing from those washed by the ocean, are seen on the height of the ridge, 

in which excavations have been made several feet, leaving the depth of the mass uncertain. On 

some of the eminences, for a considerable extent, vegetation is entirely excluded by an iron-bound 

soil. Iron ore, imbedded in an earth coloured by, and partly composed of, oxide of iron, occupies 

the surface; and chalcedony and radiated quartz are sometimes observed on the primitive ridge. 

Prospects from many of these eminences are extensive and

which was cooking out the ammunition, the _crack_, _crack_, being the report of single shells, 

whereas one loud _boom_ signified the explosion of an entire box. These shells were going off in 

all directions and it became dangerous to stay too near.  The flames on the car were of pretty 

colors. It is surprising the amount of inflammable material there is on a car. The late owner of the 

car, a lieutenant in the Royal Marine Artillery, was cursing in a low, but emphatic, marine manner, 

and several other officers from nearby batteries were attracted by the noise and the pyrotechnic 

display. I spoke to the extent of coast are in view; on the other, a rich landscape of hills and plains, 

the eye resting on the highland-chain and the mountains bordering Pennsylvania; the harbour, at 

your feet, presents a busy, ever-varying scene, and the city of New-York appears to great 

advantage from this point of observation.  The district between the mountain and the narrows, the 

thickly settled and well-cultivated plain bordering Amboy bay, and much of the western division of 

the island, are decidedly alluvial. Adjacent to Fort Tompkins, detached pieces of copper ore have 

been found. I have observed petrifactions of

Germany. Why they should hit the 'bus' when I have a brand-new pair of trench boots that I had 

never worn, I dunno." Just then and there the case cooked out and a piece of shell cut between us 

and buried itself deep in the support of a dugout, so we got under cover.

that neighbourhood, twenty feet from the surface, and sixty above the ocean.  The western part of 

the island presents moderate elevations; the soil, a good medium of sand and clay, is in general 

fertile; but a tract near the termination is sandy and barren. Some creeks penetrate to near the 

centre of the island, and are bordered by extensive salt meadows. Except at the primitive
