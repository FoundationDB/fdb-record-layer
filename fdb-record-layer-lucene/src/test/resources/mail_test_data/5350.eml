 the end of the canyon," said Harris, untying the horse. "I will follow on =
after you, and be there almost as soon as you."  Redburn would have offered=
 some objections, but the other motioned for him to mount and be off, so he=
 concluded it best to obey.  The animal was a fiery one, and soon carried h=
im out dignified and yet gently courteous.  "Ah!  Phillips," said the poet,=
 "how are you?  You must know my young friend here.  This is Wendell Philli=

we'll get home before=20

sunrise, after all."  He struck out up the gulch, or, rather, down it, for =
his course lay southward.=20

Redburn followed, and in fifteen minutes the lights of Deadwood--magic city=
 of the wilderness--

were left behind. Harris led the way along the rugged mountain stage-road, =
that, after leaving=20

Deadwood on its way to Camp Crook and Custer City in the south, runs altern=
ately through deep,=20

dark canyons and gorges, with an ease and rapidity that showed him to be we=
ll acquainted with=20

the route. About three miles below Deadwood he struck a trail through a tra=
nsverse canyon=20

running north-west, through which flowed a small stream, known as Brown's c=
reek. The bottom=20

was level and smooth, and a brisk walk of a half-hour brought them to where=
 a horse was tied=20

Boston is strange to you.  Now we're going to the theatre this evening, and=
 my plan is that you=20

come in now, have a little supper with us, and then go with us to see the p=
lay.  It is a funny play,=20

and a good laugh will do you more good than to sit in a hotel all by yourse=

think?"  Of course the boy thought as Longfellow did, and it was a very hap=
py boy that evening=20

who, in full view of the large audience in the immense theatre, sat in that=
 box.  It was, as=20

Longfellow had said, a play of laughter, and just who laughed louder, the p=
oet or the boy, neither=20

ever knew.  Between the acts there came into the box a man of courtly=20
