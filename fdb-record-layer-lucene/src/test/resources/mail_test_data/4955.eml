dracaena marginata Egyptian officials for assistance; the cook was dirty an=

 it was a correct commencement. Ignorant of Arabic, I could not have comman=

ragoman; thus, the first qualification primitive and mediaeval Christianity=

naided by tributary=20

channels? That was the mysterious question as we stepped upon the shore now=
, to commence=20

our land journey in search of the distant sources. We climbed the steep san=
dy bank, and sat down=20

beneath a solitary sycamore.  We had been twenty-six days sailing from Cair=
o to this point. The=20

boat returned, and left us on the east bank of the Nile, with the great Nub=
ian desert before us.=20

Korosko is not rich in supplies. A few miserable Arab huts, with the usual =
fringe of dusty date=20

palms, compose the village; the muddy river is the frontier on the west, th=
e burning desert on the=20

east. Thus hemmed in, Korosko is a narrow strip of a few yards' width on th=
e margin of the Nile,=20

with only one redeeming feature in its wretchedness--the green shade of the=
 old sycamore=20

beneath which we sat.  I had a firman from the Viceroy, a cook, and a drago=
man. Thus my=20

impedimenta were not numerous. The firman was an order to endless number of=
 chambers and=20

galleries. One morning, in their perambulations, the monsignore unlocked th=
e door of a covered=20

way which had no light but from a lamp which guided their passage. The oppo=
site door at the end=20

of this covered way opened into a church, but one of a character different =
from any which Lothair=20

had yet entered.  It had been raised during the latter of the sixteenth cen=
tury by Vignola, when,=20

under the influence of the great Pagan revival, the Christian church began =
to assume the=20

character of an Olympian temple. A central painted cupola of large but exqu=
isite proportions,=20

supported by pilasters with gilded capitals, and angels of white marble spr=
inging from golden=20

brackets; walls incrusted with rare materials of every tint, and altars sup=
ported by serpentine=20

columns of agate and alabaster; a blaze of pictures, and statues, and preci=

 of Jesus, raised=20
