philodendron monstera flowed out of it, the four canals which serve to carr=

 are the channels for the blood and convey the breathing air, the unborn ch=

of the service, the queen, seeing Comminges standing near her, waiting for =

tely left philodendron monstera flowed out of it, the four canals which ser=
ve to carry nutrition to the Foetus, _i.e._, the two arteries and the two v=
eins which are the channels for the blood and convey the breathing air, the=
 unborn child, according to Simon, being entirely enveloped by duty.  Towar=
d the end of the service, the queen, seeing Comminges standing near her, wa=
iting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before quitting the=
 Louvre, said in a whisper:  "Go, Comminges, and may God aid you!"  Comming=
es immediately left _
in itself. So is Mind in Thought, things inseparable from each     other wh=
ich though being one are=20

yet found dual.(803)      He [Simon] calls the first Syzygy of the six Pote=
ncies and of the=20

seventh, which is with it, Nous and Epinoia, Heaven and Earth: the     male=
 looks down from on=20

high and takes thought for his Syzygy [or     spouse], for the Earth below =
receives those=20

intellectual fruits     which are brought down from Heaven and are cognate =
to the     Earth.(804)=20

Simon's Third World with its third series of six AEons and the seventh, the=
 Parent, is emanated in=20

the same way. It is this same note which runs through every Gnostic system-=
-gradual=20

development downward into Matter by similitude; and it is a law which is to=
 be traced down to=20

primordial Occultism, or Magic. With the Gnostics, as with us, this seventh=
 Potency, synthesizing=20

all, is the Spirit brooding over the dark waters of undifferentiated Space,=
 Narayana, or Vishnu, in=20

India; the Holy Ghost in Christianity. But while in the latter the concepti=
on is conditioned and=20

dwarfed by limitations necessitating faith and grace, Eastern Philosophy sh=
ows it pervading every=20

atom, conscious or unconscious. Irenaeus supplements the information on the=
 further=20

development of these six AEons. We learn from him that Thought, having sepa=
rated itself from its=20

Parent, and knowing through its identity of Essence with the latter what it=
 had to know, proceeded=20

on the second or intermediate plane, or rather World (each of such Worlds c=
onsisting of two=20

planes, the superior and inferior, male and female, the latter assuming fin=
ally both Potencies and=20

becoming androgyne), to create inferior Hierarchies, Angels and Powers, Dom=
inions and Hosts, of=20

every description, which in their turn created, or rather emanated out of t=
heir own Essence, our=20

world with its men and beings, over which they watch.  It thus follows that=
 every rational being--

called Man on Earth--is of the same essence and possesses potentially all t=
he attributes of the=20

higher AEons, the primordial Seven. It is for him to develope, "with the im=
age before him of the=20

highest," by imitation _in actu_, the Potency with which the highest of his=
 Parents, or Fathers, is=20

endowed. Here we may again quote with advantage from the _Philosophumena_: =
      So then,=20

according to Simon, this blissful and imperishable     [principle] is conce=
aled in everything in=20

potency, not in act.     This is "that which has stood, stands and will sta=
nd," _viz._,     that which=20

has stood above in ingenerable Potency; that which     stands below in the =
stream of the waters=20

generated in an image;     that which will stand above, beside the blissful=
 infinite Potency,     if it=20

makes itself like unto this image. For three, he says, are     they that st=
and, and without these=20

three AEons of stability, there     is no adornment of the generable which,=
 according to them [the=20

on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpe=
t, which he counterfeited=20

quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called =
forth the praises of=20

amateurs of imitative harmony.  This amusement lasted from the Barriere des=
 Sergens to the=20

place of Notre Dame, and Friquet found in it very real enjoyment; but when =
at last the regiment=20

separated, penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extrem=
ity of the Rue Saint=20

Christophe, near the Rue Cocatrix, in which Broussel lived, then Friquet re=
membered that he had=20

not had breakfast; and after thinking in which direction he had better turn=
 his steps in order to=20

accomplish this important act of the day, he reflected deeply and decided t=
hat Councillor Broussel=20

should bear the cost of this repast.  In consequence he took to his heels, =
arrived breathlessly at=20

the councillor's door, and knocked violently.  His mother, the councillor's=
 old servant, opened it.=20

"What doest thou here, good-for-nothing?" she said, "and why art thou not a=
t Notre Dame?"  "I=20

have been there, mother," said Friquet, "but I saw things happen of which M=
aster Broussel ought=20



to be warned, and so with Monsieur Bazin's permission--you know, mother, Mo=
nsieur Bazin, the=20

verger--I came to speak to Monsieur Broussel."  "And what hast thou to say,=
 boy, to Monsieur=20

Broussel?"  "I wish to tell him," replied Friquet, screaming with all his m=
ight, "that there is a whole=20

regiment of guards coming this way. And as I hear everywhere that at the co=
urt they are ill-

disposed to him, I wish to warn him, that he may be on his guard."  Brousse=
l heard the scream of=20

the young oddity, and, enchanted with this excess of zeal, came down to the=
 first floor, for he was,=20

in truth, working in his room on the second.  "Well," said he, "friend, wha=
t matters the regiment of=20

guards to us, and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance? Knowest thou=
 not that it is the=20

custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment =
to form themselves into=20

two solid walls when the king goes by?"  Friquet counterfeited surprise, an=
d twisting his new cap=20

around in his fingers, said:  "It is not astonishing for you to know it, Mo=
nsieur Broussel, who knows=20

everything; but as for me, by holy truth, I did not know it and I thought I=
 would give you good=20

advice; you must not be angry with me for that, Monsieur Broussel."  "On th=
e contrary, my boy, on=20

the contrary, I am pleased with your zeal. Dame Nanette, look for those apr=
icots which Madame=20

de Longueville sent to us yesterday from Noisy and give half a dozen of the=
m to your son, with a=20

crust of new bread."  "Oh, thank you, sir, thank you, Monsieur Broussel," s=
aid Friquet; "I am so=20

fond of apricots!"  Broussel then proceeded to his wife's room and asked fo=
r breakfast; it was nine=20

o'clock. The councillor placed himself at the window; the street was=20


_
the similitude is a perfect and celestial (AEon), in no manner of     think=
ing inferior to the=20

ingenerable Potency. Thus they say: "I     and thou [are] one; before me [w=
ast] thou; that which is=20

after     thee [is] I." This, he says, is the one Potency, divided into    =
 above and below, generating=20

itself, nourishing itself, seeking     itself, finding itself; its own moth=
er, father, brother, spouse,=20

daughter and son, one, for it is the Root of all.(805)   Thus of this tripl=
e AEon, we learn the first=20

exists as "that which has stood, stands and will stand," or the uncreate Po=
wer, Atman; the second=20

is generated in the dark waters of Space (Chaos, or undifferentiated Substa=
nce, our Buddhi), from=20

or through the image of the former reflected in those waters, the image of =
Him, or It, which moves=20

on them; the third World (or, in man, Manas) will be endowed with every pow=
er of that eternal and=20

noise of the tide rushing in, the deep hum of the populous waves increasing=
 now around Notre=20

Dame.  This noise redoubled when D'Artagnan, with a company of musketeers, =
placed himself at=20

the gates of Notre Dame to secure the service of the church. He had instruc=
ted Porthos to profit by=20

this opportunity to see the ceremony; and Porthos, in full dress, mounted h=
is finest horse, taking=20

the part of supernumerary musketeer, as D'Artagnan had so often done former=
ly. The sergeant of=20

this company, a veteran of the Spanish wars, had recognized Porthos, his ol=
d companion, and=20

very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of start=
ling facts concerning=20

the honor of the ancient musketeers of Treville. Porthos had not only been =
well received by the=20

company, but he was moreover looked on with great admiration.  At ten o'clo=
ck the guns of the=20

Louvre announced the departure of the king,=20


_
All that is eternal, pure and incorruptible is concealed in     everything =
that is,   if only potentially,=20

not actually. And       Everything is that image, provided the lower image =
(man) ascends     to that=20

highest Source and Root in Spirit and Thought.   Matter as Substance is ete=
rnal and has never=20

been created. Therefore Simon Magus, with all the great Gnostic Teachers an=
d Eastern=20

Philosophers, never speaks of its beginning. "Eternal Matter" receives its =
various forms in the=20

lower AEon from the Creative Angels, or Builders, as we call them. Why, the=
n, should not Man, the=20

direct heir of the highest AEon, do the same, by the potency of his thought=
, which is born from=20

Spirit? This is that bend and writhe with agitated tops, ran though the mul=
titude, which was=20

compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard. At last the king appe=
ared with the queen=20

in a gilded chariot. Ten other carriages followed, containing the ladies of=
 honor, the officers of the=20

royal household, and the court.  "God save the king!" was the cry in every =
direction; the young=20

monarch gravely put his head out of the window, looked sufficiently gratefu=
l and even bowed; at=20

which the cries of the multitude were renewed.  Just as the court was settl=
ing down in the=20

cathedral, a carriage, bearing the arms of Comminges, quitted the line of t=
he court carriages and=20

proceeded slowly to the end of the Rue Saint=20


_
the potency of Ideation and Will, from invisible, indestructible Matter.  T=
ruly says Jeremiah,(806)=20

quoting the "Word of the Lord":       Before I formed thee in the belly I k=
new thee; and before thou=20

camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee,   for Jeremiah stands here =
for Man when he was=20

yet an AEon, or Divine Man, both with Simon Magus and Eastern Philosophy. T=
he first three=20

chapters of _Genesis_ are as Occult as that which is given in Paper I. For =
the terrestrial Paradise=20

is the Womb, says Simon,(807) Eden the region surrounding it. The river whi=
ch went out of Eden=20

to water the garden is the Umbilical Cord; this cord is divided into four H=
eads, the entirely=20

deserted. When it arrived there, four guards and a police officer, who acco=
mpanied it, mounted=20

into the heavy machine and closed the shutters; then through an opening cau=
tiously made, the=20

policeman began to watch the length of the Rue Cocatrix, as if he was waiti=
ng for some one.  All=20

the world was occupied with the ceremony, so that neither the chariot nor t=
he precautions taken by=20

those who were within it had been observed. Friquet, whose eye, ever on the=
 alert, could alone=20

have discovered them, had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature =
of a house in the=20

square of Notre Dame. Thence he saw the king, the queen and Monsieur Mazari=
n, and heard the=20
