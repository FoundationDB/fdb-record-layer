no historian, but a great man with a great heart William Makepeace Thackeray! For "greater love 

hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."  Heroism was contagious in 

those days as for all time, and the example of Eustace de Saint-Pierre was speedily followed by 

five of his fellow townsmen. Let us now pass to the heroine of the story, Queen Philippa. When the 

six burgesses, in their humble state, were led to the feet of the haughty and relentless Edward, all 

pleas were vain to save them, the king turning away in wrath even from the faithful Walter de 

Manny and commanding that the hangman be summoned. "Then the Queen, being great with 

child, kneeled down, and sore weeping said: 'Ah, gentle sir, sith I passed the sea in great peril I

dame, I would ye had been as now in some other place; ye make such request to me that I cannot 

deny you. Wherefore I give them to you, to do your pleasure with them.' Then the Queen caused 

them to be brought into her chamber, and made the halters to be taken from their necks, and 

caused them to be new clothed, and gave them their dinner at their leisure; and then she gave 

each of them six nobles, and made them to be brought out of the host in safeguard and set at their 

liberty."  A noble picture is this of the clemency of a woman where the prayers of men availed not; 

and we join Jean Froissart in honoring his royal patroness and mistress, "the most gentle Queen, 

most liberal and most courteous that ever was Queen in her days, the which was the fair lady 

Philippa of Hainault, Queen of England and Ireland." But it was not for her mercifulness alone or
