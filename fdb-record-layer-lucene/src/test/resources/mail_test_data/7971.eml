dracaena marginata was still able to maintain its high level of profanity. =
The ship is in pitch darkness and there is no moon. On deck it's almost imp=
ossible to walk it's so dark. Tonight is supposed to be the night on which =
the Germans are going to make a raid. I am going to sleep on deck so that I=
 shall not miss anything. I'd hate to miss the chance of seeing a naval eng=
agement. I can't see how the Germans can possibly let a chance the combusti=
on of that metal, and of gold and silver, and of many other metals; that th=
e fusion of the earths, of rock crystal, of gun flint, of the corundum gems=
, and many other, very refractory substances; and the production of light b=
eyond the brightness of the sun, have been familiar experiments in my labor=
atory. I have uniformly given Mr. Hare the full credit of the invention, al=
though my researches, with his dracaena marginata was still able to maintai=

miles away on the port. The Laurentic took up a similar position on the sta=
rboard. Both these ships=20

are armored and have guns mounted on them. They are being used as scouts.  =
We all rushed up=20

on deck to see a cruiser pass close to us this midday. It was a magnificent=
 sight. She was either=20

the H.M.S. Bristol or the H.M.S. Essex; her name was painted The bluejacket=
s were massed on=20

the decks forward and as she went by the marines' band played "The Maple Le=
af Forever." We=20

returned cheers with the sailors. It gives you a great thrill to see a Brit=
ish ship and to have the=20

knowledge of what it represents. To be British is a great thing, and I'm pr=
oud to think that I'm going=20

to fight for my country. When this war is over and men are talking round a =
table, it will be, "Where=20

were you fighting during the war?" not "Did you fight during the war?"     =
               ----------------------

---------------  I'm in a gun-cleaning squad every afternoon. To-day I clea=
ned the machine gun on=20

which I'm second gunner. We treat our machine guns as if they were pets. No=
 one will ever be=20

able to say that my gun is dirty. It will probably be my best friend some d=
ay.  The finding of the=20

court-martial was read out to us on full parade this afternoon. First the "=
Heavies" were lined up on=20

all sides of the deck, then the "Mosquitos," as the Machine Gunners are cal=
led, lined up inside; the=20

prisoner between an escort was led up in the center. It was wonderfully imp=
ressive. I felt that I was=20

to witness the condemning of a fellow soldier to a number of years of hard =
labor. Over the whole=20

assembly there came a deathlike silence and the finding of the court was re=
ad to us by an officer,=20

the sentence being thirty-six days!  The second steward told me that it too=
k two hundred=20

carpenters twelve hours to tear down the cabins and fix up horse fittings. =
First the authorities=20

made arrangements to ship a thousand troops on this ship. We're crowded as =
we are now with=20

only three hundred odd. I hate to think what it would have been of exciting=
 heat, by which the=20

gems, and all the most refractory substances in nature, are immediately mel=
ted, and even in=20

various instances dissipated in vapour, or decomposed into their elements. =
The first glance at=20

these statements, (which, as regards the effects, I have no doubt are subst=
antially true,) was=20

sufficient to satisfy me, that the basis of these discoveries was laid by a=
n American discovery,=20

made by Mr. Robert Hare of Philadelphia, in 1801. In December of that year,=
 Mr. Hare=20

communicated to the Chemical Society of Philadelphia his discovery of a met=
hod of burning=20

oxygen and hydrogen gases in a united stream, so as to produce a very inten=
se heat.  In 1802, he=20

published a detailed memoir on the subject, with an engraving of his appara=
tus, and he recited the=20

effects of his instrument; some of which, in the degree of heat produced, s=
urpassed any thing=20

before known.  In 1802, and 1803, I was occupied with him, in Philadelphia,=
 in prosecuting similar=20

experiments on a more extended scale; and a communication on the subject wa=
s made to the=20

Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. The memoir is printed in their trans=
actions; and Mr. Hare's=20

original memoir was reprinted in the Annals of Chemistry, in Paris, and in =
the Philosophical=20

Magazine, in London.  Mr. Murray, in his System of Chemistry, has mentioned=
 Mr. Hare's results=20

in the fusion of several of the earths, &c. and has given him credit for hi=
s discovery.  In one=20

instance, while in Europe, in 1806, at a public lecture, I saw some of them=
 exhibited by a=20

celebrated Professor, who mentioned Mr. Hare as the reputed author of the i=
nvention.  In=20

December, 1811, I instituted an extended course of experiments with Mr. Har=
e's blowpipe, in=20

which I melted lime and magnesia, and a long list of the most refractory mi=
nerals, gems, and=20

others, the greater part of which had never been melted before, and I suppo=
sed that I had=20

decomposed lime, barytes, strontites, and magnesia, evolving their metallic=
 basis, which burnt in=20



the air as fast as=20

-------------------------------------  Early this morning a large man-o'-wa=
r came up on the port at a speed=20

that made everything else seem to stop. We have now battleships on all side=
s. This ship, although=20

a long way off, looks tremendous. She is one of the latest super-dreadnaugh=
ts.  I was on guard=20

last night when one of the cruisers came alongside to TALK to the captain a=
bout having lights=20

showing in some of the ports. I enjoyed it immensely, for I discovered that=
 the British Navy, true to=20

the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, who published it in their Tra=
nsactions for 1812;=20

with their leave it was communicated to Dr Bruce's Mineralogical Journal, a=
nd it was printed in the=20

4th number of that work. Hundreds of my pupils can testify that Mr. Hare's =
splendid experiments,=20

and many others performed with his blowpipe, fed by oxygen and hydrogen gas=
es, have been for=20

years past annually exhibited, in my public courses of chemistry in Yale Co=
llege, and that the=20
