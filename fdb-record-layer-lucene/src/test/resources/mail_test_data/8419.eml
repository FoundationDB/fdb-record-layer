future. Black and yellow races are increasing and growing so rapidly that they may be ready to 

brim over their boundaries some day and swamp the white civilizations. Anglo-Saxons ought to be 

prepared, and to stand hand in hand to help one another. I've been reading some queer things 

lately. One is that a new continent is slowly rising out of the Pacific Ocean--Lemuria they call it--

and some day, hundreds of years hence, there may be land there instead of water, and people 

living on it. They say too that the contained in the Llanos of Caracas, Barcelona, Cumana, and 

Spanish Guiana. M. Depons, who lived in the town of Caracas longer than I, and whose statistical 

statements are generally accurate, reckons in those vast plains, from the mouths of the Orinoco to 

the lake of Maracaybo, 1,200,000 oxen, 180,000 horses, and 90,000 mules. He estimates the 

produce of these herds at 5,000,000 francs; adding to the value of the exportation the price of the 

hides consumed in the country. There exist, it is believed, in the 


_
United States is moving towards the Pacific. Sydney may grow more important than London, and 

San Francisco than New York when the trade routes make them fresh pivots of energy. Another 

funny thing I read is that as the world is changing a new race seems to be emerging. Travelers say 

that the modern children in Australia don't look in the least like English children or French children, 

or any European nation--they are a fresh type. America has been populated by people from 

practically all the older countries, but I read that children who are being born there now differ in 

their head measurements from babies of the older races. Perhaps some of you may be interested 

in this and some of you may only be bored, but what I want to rub in and 3,000,000 horses, 

without comprising in this enumeration the cattle that have no acknowledged proprietor.  I shall not 

hazard any general estimates, which from their nature are too uncertain; but shall only observe 

that, in the Llanos of Caracas, the proprietors of the great hatos are entirely ignorant of the 

number of the cattle they possess. They only know that of the young cattle, which are branded 

every year with a letter or mark peculiar to each herd. The richest proprietors mark as many as 

14,000 head every year; and sell to the number of five or six thousand. According to official 

documents, the exportation of hides from the whole capitania-general of Caracas amounted 

annually to 174,000 skins of oxen, and 11,500 of

superior, race is evolving it's surely part of our work to help it on. Here we all are, girls from 

England, America, and the British Colonies, of the same race and speaking the same language. 

Let us make an Anglo-Saxon League, and pledge ourselves that wherever we go over the face of 

the world we will carry with us the best traditions. We're out for Peace, not War, and Peace comes 

through sympathy. The women of those great eastern nations, the Chinese, the Japanese, and the 

Hindoos, who are only just awakening to a sense of freedom, will look to us Westerners for their 

example. Can't we hold out the hand of sisterhood to them, and teach them our highest ideals, so 

that in the centuries to come they may be our friends instead of our enemies? It's a case of 'Take 

up the White Man's burden.' We stand together, not as Scotch, or Canadians, or New Zealanders 

or of the custom-houses, where no mention is made of the fraudulent dealings in hides, we are 

tempted to believe that the estimate of 1,200,000 oxen wandering in the Llanos, from the Rio 

Carony and the Guarapiche to the lake of Maracaybo, is much underrated. The port of La Guayra 

alone exported annually from 1789 to 1792, 70,000 or 80,000 hides, entered in the custom-house 

books, scarcely one-fifth of which was sent to Spain. The exportation from Buenos Ayres, at the 

end of the eighteenth century, was, according to Don Felix de Azara, 800,000 skins. The hides of 

Caracas are preferred in the Peninsula to those of Buenos Ayres; because the latter, on account 

of a longer passage, undergo a loss of twelve per cent in the tanning. The southern part of the 

savannahs, commonly called the Upper Plains (Llanos de arriba), is very productive in mules and 

oxen; but the pasturage

apostles of peace, not 'frightfulness.'  "I'm going to ask every girl in this room to join the League. 

There'll be various activities in connection with it. We haven't decided all yet, but we hope one of 

them will be to establish a correspondence between this school and other schools in England and 

the Colonies and in America. We'd like to write letters to their prefects and hear what they are 

doing, and have copies of their school magazines. It would be less good, these animals are 

obliged to be sent to other plains to be fattened before they are sold. The Llano de Monai, and all 

the Lower Plains (Llanos de abaxo), abound less in herds, but the pastures are so fertile, that they 

furnish meat of an excellent quality for the supply of the coast. The mules, which are not fit for 

labour before the fifth year, are purchased on the spot at the price of fourteen or eighteen piastres.

shaking hands over the ocean. Then why shouldn't we correspond with girls in missionary schools 

in India or China or Japan? Think how exciting to have letters from them and read them aloud. We 

should hear all about their eastern lives, and all kinds of interesting things.  "Well, these are far-

away schemes yet that need a little time to establish. I've something much nearer to put before 

you. Miss Rodgers has given us seniors leave to hold a fancy-dress dance on the 31st of March, 

from 7.30 to 9.30, here in the gym. We invite every girl who joins the League to come. Nationality 

costumes will be welcomed. There will be first, second, and third prizes for the best dresses. The 

judges will take into consideration the scantiness of the materials available, but they wish to 

announce that any girl found guilty of borrowing articles for her costume without the leave of their 

owners will be disqualified, and further, that any member of the League convicted of playing 

practical jokes will be expelled from the dance. The prefects think it wise and necessary to 

mention that, though the evening of March 31st has been set aside as a holiday and certain rules 

have been relaxed, the school is nevertheless bound to preserve its usual code of good manners, 

and every girl is Spanish breed, are not very large; they are generally of a uniform colour, brown 

bay, like most of the wild animals. Suffering alternately from drought and floods, tormented by the 

stings of insects and the bites of the large bats, they lead a sorry life. After having enjoyed for 

some months the care of man, their good qualities are developed. Here there are no sheep: we 

saw flocks only on the table-land of Quito.  The hatos of oxen have suffered considerably of late 

from troops of marauders, who roam over the steppes killing the animals merely to take their 

hides. This robbery has increased since the trade of the Lower Orinoco has become more 

flourishing. For half a century, the banks of that great river, from the mouth of the Apure as far as 

Angostura, were known only to the missionary-monks. The exportation of cattle took place from 

the ports of the northern coast only, namely from Cumana, Barcelona, Burburata, and Porto 

Cabello. This dependence on the coast is now much diminished. The southern part of the plains 

has established an internal communication with the Lower Orinoco; and this trade is the more 

brisk, as those who devote themselves to it easily escape the trammels of the prohibitory laws. 

The greatest herds of cattle in the Llanos of Caracas are 


_
sure I need not say more, for you surely understand me, and agree that when Miss Rodgers has 

allowed us to have this fun we ought not to abuse her kindness. Will every one who's ready to join 

the League and wants to come to the dance hold up her hand."  Almost every girl in the room 

responded to Rachel's invitation. Some--the higher-thinking ones--were attracted by the ideals of 

the League itself; others were merely anxious not to be left out of the festivities. It was a long time 

since the school had hatos of Merecure, La Cruz, Belen, Alta Gracia, and Pavon. The Spanish 

cattle came from Coro and Tocuyo into the plains. History has preserved the name of the colonist 

who first conceived the idea of peopling these pasturages, inhabited only by deer, and a large 

species of cavy.* (* The thick-nosed tapir, or river cavy (Cavia capybara), called chiguire in those 

countries.) Christoval Rodriguez sent the first horned cattle into the Llanos, about the year 1548. 

He was an inhabitant of the town of Tocuyo,
