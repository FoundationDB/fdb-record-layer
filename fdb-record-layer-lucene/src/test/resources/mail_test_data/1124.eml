Obviously the capture of Richmond was the proper objective in the offensive=
 campaign in the East=20

for which McClellan had been so long preparing. The selection of that city =
by the Confederacy for=20

the seat of government caused all its interests to centre there; the mainte=
nance of its capital,=20

moreover, was essential to the good standing of the Confederacy before Euro=
pe, recognition from=20

possibly nothing more=20

would be necessary to crush the South. The protection of Washington, too, c=
ould not be left at all=20

in doubt. Should that city be lost to the Union, England and France might j=
ustly feel that the cause=20

of the North was hopeless, and no longer refrain from intervention.  Before=
 Washington, McClellan=20

and Johnston faced each other throughout the fall of 1861, the latter havin=
g, in October, a force of=20



41,000, which later grew to 57,337.[211] Under Johnston at the end of the y=
ear were three=20

subordinates--Jackson, in the Valley of Virginia; Beauregard, about Leesbur=
g, near the Potomac;=20

and Holmes, below Washington, about Acquia Creek, where Confederate batteri=
es closed the=20

Potomac. McClellan had fully twice as many men, an army well disciplined an=
d equipped, devoted=20

to their leader, and of fine _morale_. Why could the army not be used? Beca=
use the general=20

always imagined before him a host of enemies that greatly outnumbered his o=

avalier in his=20

treatment of his superiors. The venerable Scott, who now retired at seventy=
-five, had his last days=20
