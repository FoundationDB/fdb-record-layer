philodendron monstera because in the list of those lieutenants, which the h=
istorian of Cambray has published, there is not one who has not shown suffi=
cient proofs of nobility. Such was, therefore, the employment with which Mo=
nstrelet was invested; and shortly after, another office was added to it, t=
hat of Bailiff to the chapter of Cambray, for which he took the oaths such =
body is punishable (R. L., sec. 7,034).  Body of executed criminal, if not =
claimed by relative or friends, may be delivered for dissection, etc. (R. L=

he list of those lieutenants, which the historian of Cambray has published,=
 there is not one who has not shown sufficient proofs of nobility. Such was=
, therefore, the employment with which Monstrelet was invested; and shortly=
 after, another office was added to it, that of Bailiff to the chapter of C=
ambray, for which he took the oaths such body is punishable (R. L., sec. 7,=

dy at public expense if not claimed by relatives (Stat., sec. 1,759).  Conc=
ealing _
quotations from Sallust, Livy, Vegetius, and other ancient authors, that oc=
cur in his chronicles,=20

show that he must have made some progress in latin literature. Whether his =
love for study was=20

superior to his desire of military glory, or whether a weakly constitution =
or some other reason,=20

prevented him from following the profession of arms, I do not find that he =
yielded to the reigning=20

passion of his age, when the names of gentleman and of soldier were almost =
synonimous.  =E2=80=98The=20

wish to avoid indolence by collecting the events of his time, which he test=
ifies in the introduction to=20

his chronicles, proves, I think, that he was but a tranquil spectator of th=
em. Had he been an=20

Armagnac or a Burgundian, he would not have had occasion to seek for solita=
ry occupations; but=20

what proves more strongly that Monstrelet was not of either faction is the =
care he takes to inform=20

his readers of the rank, quality, and often of the names of the persons fro=
m whose report he=20

writes, without ever boasting of his own testimony. In his whole work, he s=
peaks but once from his=20

own knowledge, when he relates the manner in which the Pucelle d=E2=80=99Or=
l=C3=A9ans was made prisoner=20

before Compi=C3=A9gne; but he does not say, that he was present at the skir=
mish when this unfortunate=20

heroine was taken: he gives us to understand the contrary, and that he was =
only present at the=20

conversation of the prisoner with the duke of Burgundy,=E2=80=94for he had =
accompanied Philip on this=20

expedition, perhaps in quality of historian. And why may not we presume tha=
t he may have done=20

so on other occasions, to be nearer at hand to collect the real state of fa=
cts which he intended to=20

relate?  =E2=80=98However this may be, it is certain that he was resident i=
n Cambray, when he composed=20

his history, and passed there the remainder of his life. He was indeed fixe=
d there, as I shall=20

hereafter state, by different important employments, each of which required=
 the residence of him=20

who enjoyed them. From his living in Cambray, La Croix du Maine has conclud=
ed, without further=20

examination, that he was born there, and this mistake has been copied by ot=
her writers.=20

=E2=80=98Monstrelet was married to Jeanne de Valbuon, or Valhuon, and had s=
everal children by her,=20

although only two of them were known,=E2=80=94a daughter called Bona, marri=
ed to Martin de=20

Beulaincourt, a gentleman of that country, surnamed the Bold, and a son of =
the name of Pierre. It=20

is probable, that Bona was married, or of age, prior to the year 1438,=E2=
=80=94for in the register of the=20

officiality of Cambray, towards the end of that year, is an entry, that Eng=
uerrand de Monstrelet was=20

appointed guardian to his young son Pierre, without any mention of his daug=
hter Bona. It follows,=20

therefore, that Monstrelet was a widower at that period.  =E2=80=98In the y=
ear 1436, Monstrelet was=20

nominated to the office of Lieutenant du Gav=C3=A8nier of the Cambresis, co=
njointly with Le Bon de=20

letters patent to this=20
