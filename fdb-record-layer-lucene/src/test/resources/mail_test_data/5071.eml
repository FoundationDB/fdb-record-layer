  1. While your divine intelligence=20

and will, Imperator Caesar, were engaged in acquiring the right to command =
the world, and while=20

your fellow citizens, when all their enemies had been laid low by your invi=
ncible valour, were=20

glorying in your triumph and victory,--while all foreign nations were in su=
bjection awaiting your=20

beck and call, and the Roman people and senate, released from their alarm, =
were beginning to be=20

guided by your most noble conceptions and policies, I hardly dared, in view=
 of your serious=20

employments, to publish my writings and long considered ideas on architectu=
re, for fear of=20

subjecting myself to your displeasure by an unseasonable interruption.  2. =
But when I saw that you=20

were giving your attention not only to the welfare of society in general an=
d to the establishment of=20

public order, but also to the providing of public buildings intended for ut=
ilitarian purposes, so that=20

not only should the State have been enriched with provinces by your means, =
but that the=20

greatness of its power might likewise be attended with distinguished author=
ity in its public=20

buildings, I thought that I ought to take the first opportunity to lay befo=
re you my writings on this=20

theme. For in the first place it was this subject which made me known to yo=
ur father, to whom I=20

was devoted on account of his great qualities. After the council of heaven =
gave him a place in the=20

dwellings of immortal life and transferred your father's power to your hand=
s, my devotion=20

continuing unchanged as I remembered him inclined me to support you. And so=
 with Marcus=20

Aurelius, Publius Minidius, and Gnaeus Cornelius, I was ready to supply and=
 repair ballistae,=20

scorpiones, and other artillery, and I have received rewards for good servi=
ce with them. After your=20

first bestowal of these upon me, you continued to renew them on the recomme=
ndation of your=20

sister.  3. Owing to this favour I need have no fear of want to the end of =
my life, and being thus laid=20

under obligation I began to write this work for you, because I saw that you=
 have built and are now=20

building extensively, and that in future also you will take care that our p=
ublic and private buildings=20

shall be worthy to go down to under a sudden impulse, he dashed out of the =
room followed by=20

Little Jim, and rushed into the street just as the first of the crowd came =
up.  "This way!  Straight on!=20

hooray!" he shouted, leading off the crowd in the direction of the river.  =
The crowd followed.  The=20

Bloater led them into a maze of intricate back streets; shot far ahead of t=
hem, and then, doubling,=20

like a hare, into a retired corner, stood chuckling there while the shoutin=
g crowd swept by.  For a=20

few minutes, Little Jim was utterly bereft of speech, owing to a compound o=
f amazement, delight,=20

excitement and exhaustion.  After a little time he said--  "Well, this _is_=
 a lark!  But, I say, Bloater,=20

d'ye think it was right to let 'im off like that?"  "Who's let 'im off, sto=
opid?" retorted the Bloater.=20

"Don't I know 'is name--at least part of it; an' the 'abitation of 'is wife=
, or sweet-'eart, or sister, or=20

suthin' o' that sort?"  "Oh, ah, werry true," replied Little Jim, with a te=
rminating "sk!"  "Well, that=20

bein' 'ow it is, we han't let 'im off just yet, d'ye see? So, now we'll go =
an' turn in."  With that=20

observation the Bloater and Little Jim went away to search for and appropri=
ate some convenient=20

place of repose for the night.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  Seated by the fire-side o=

le--Bob Clazie chatted=20



and smoked his pipe contentedly.  At the conclusion of a remark, he looked =
up in Mrs Dashwood's=20

puzzled face, and said, "That's 'ow it is, d'ye see?"  "No, I don't see," r=
eplied Mary, with a smile.=20

"No? well, now, that _is_ koorious.  W'y, it's as plain as the nose on my f=
ace.  See here.  As the=20

law now stands, there is no public authority to inwestigate the cause o' fi=
res in London; well, wot's=20

the consikence, w'y, that there are regular gangs of scoundrels who make it=
 their business to=20

arrange fires for their own adwantage."  "Now, that's just what I don't und=
erstand," said Mary,=20

knitting her pretty brows; "what advantage _can_ it be to any one to set fi=
re to a house, except to=20

pick-pockets who may get a chance of doing business in the crowd?"  "Well, =
that of itself is=20

enough to endooce some blackguards to raise a fire, and likewise to get the=
 shillin' for bringin' the=20

observing them, to have personal knowledge of the quality both of existing =

which are yet to be constructed. For in the following books I have disclose=

art.     which they 'ave a good deal of the furniture itself to sell or do =
wot they please with.  That's=20

 silence on the other side=20

of the fire, nodded, and, turning his head round, advised Fred Crashington =
and little May to make=20
