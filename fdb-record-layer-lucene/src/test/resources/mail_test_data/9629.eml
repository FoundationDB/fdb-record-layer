The assembly now broke up, and the princes and lords retired to their diffe=
rent h=C3=B4tels. The duke of=20

Burgundy was escorted to his h=C3=B4tel d=E2=80=99Artois by a large body of=
 men at arms and archers.  There=20

were great murmurings in Paris among all ranks, for the assembly had been o=
pen to all,=20

respecting the charges made against the late duke of Orleans, and various w=
ere the opinions=20

concerning them. Those attached to the Orleans-party declared they were all=
 false, whilst the=20

Burgundians maintained the contrary.  Shortly afterward, queen Isabella of =
France, apprehensive=20

of consequences to herself and children, set out from Paris with her son th=
e duke of Acquitaine=20

and the others, accompanied by Louis duke of Bavaria, her brother, and fixe=
d her residence in the=20

castle of Melun. The king, who had been very ill of his disorder for some t=
ime, now recovered: the=20

duke of Burgundy waited on him, and was not only reconciled but obtained le=
tters sealed with the=20

king=E2=80=99s seal and signed with his own hand, by which he was pardoned =
for what had lately happened=20

to the duke of Orleans, to the astonishment of many great lords and wise me=
n, but at this moment=20

it could not be otherwise.                                    CHAP. XL.    =
  THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS A=20

SOLEMN EMBASSY TO THE POPE.=E2=80=94THE         ANSWER THEY RECEIVE.=E2=80=
=94THE POPE=20

EXCOMMUNICATES THE KING         AND HIS ADHERENTS.   About this period, som=
e persons=20

came to the king and the lords then at Paris, to inform them, that the pope=
 and his rival would=20

neither of them resign the popedom, as they had promised in the city of Sav=
ona,=E2=80=94but by various=20

deceitful means kept up the schism that had so long hurt the true interests=
 of the church. The king,=20

in consequence, wrote letters to the pope, and sent them by Jean de Ch=C3=
=A2teau-morant and Jean=20

de Coursen, knights, his ambassadors, to declare, that if peace were not fi=
rmly established=20

throughout the Christian church by Ascension day next ensuing, he himself a=
nd the clergy, nobles=20

and people of his realm and of Dauphiny, would no longer obey him or his ad=
versary.  Pope=20

Benedict was not well pleased with the contents of these letters, nor with =
the embassy, although=20

he dissembled with the ambassadors. He made them a short answer, saying he =
would speedily=20

reply to the letters they had brought, after which they took leave of him a=
nd returned to Paris, to=20

make the king and council acquainted with all that had passed. It was not l=
ong before a=20

messenger from the pope arrived at Paris, who went to the h=C3=B4tel de St =
Pol, and, understanding the=20

king was in his oratory at the commencement of the mass, proceeded thither,=
 and presenting the=20

king with an apostolical letter instantly departed.  When mass was over, th=
e king caused the letter=20

to be opened, and deliberately read, by which he learnt that he himself and=
 all his subjects were=20

excommunicated.  Search was instantly made in Paris after the person who ha=
d brought this=20

excommunication, but in vain, for he had quitted the city as secretly and s=
uddenly as he could.=20

The king and his council, noticing the manner and form of this act, in comp=
liance with the=20

exhortations of the university of Paris, the greater part of his council, a=
nd the princes of the blood,=20

who were all much angered with the pope, he withdrew himself from his obedi=
ence to the holy see.=20

THE APOSTOLICAL LETTER RECEIVED BY THE KING.  =E2=80=98Benedict, bishop and=
 servant to the=20

servants of God, to his very dear son in JESUS CHRIST, Charles king of Fran=
ce, sends health=20

and apostolical benediction.  =E2=80=98Would to God, very dear son, that th=
ou knewest the love and=20

affection we bear to thy noble and potent person, and didst understand the =
purity of our mind, thou=20

wouldest then be sensible of the great joy we feel in thy prosperity, and o=
f our grief at any=20

tribulations that befal thee. If of they are multiple may be of itself mort=
al, but taken together they=20

are so. Consequently we will suppose that there are but two wounds, and not=
 multiple ones, and=20



the question remains which of these wounds was the cause of death. A wound =
may be said to be=20

of itself mortal when it is the cause of death directly or indirectly in sp=
ite of the best medical=20

assistance. In some continental states mortal wounds are divided into two c=
lasses, those=20

absolutely and those conditionally mortal, the former including those in wh=
ich the best medical=20

assistance is at hand, sent for or timely rendered without everting the res=
ult. The mortal result in=20

the second class is conditional on want of treatment, improper treatment, o=
r accidental=20

circumstances. As Taylor says, it is better to look at the effect of the wo=
und and the intent of the=20

assailant, as is done in English law, rather than at accidental relations o=
f the wound.  To return to=20

the question, we can readily imagine that a man may receive two wounds at d=
ifferent times or from=20

different persons, and die after the second wound. Taylor[629] mentions the=
 following case in=20

which the question arose as to which of two injuries caused death: In Reg. =
_v._ Foreman (C.C.C.=20

February, 1873) the prisoner had struck the deceased some severe blows on t=
he head. A fortnight=20

later, having partially recovered, another man gave him some severe blows o=
n the head. A=20

fortnight later still he had left hemiplegia, and died a few days later of =
a large abscess in the brain.=20

The question arose which set of blows had been the cause of the abscess. Th=
e prisoner, the first=20

assailant, was acquitted, as the deceased had had no serious symptoms until=
 the second assault,=20

and there was no satisfactory medical evidence as to the relation of the tw=
o assaults to the=20

abscess formation. The same author also supposes the following case: A man =
having received a=20

gunshot wound of the shoulder is doing well, when in another quarrel he rec=
eives a penetrating=20

stab-wound of the thorax and abdomen. He dies after lingering for a time, u=
nder the effects of=20

these wounds. If the wound of the shoulder could be proven to be the cause =
of death, the second=20

assailant could not be convicted of manslaughter, and so too with the first=
 assailant if it could be=20

shown that the victim died of the stab-wound. It might be possible for a su=
rgeon to decide the=20

question definitely at once if death occurred soon after the stab, which wa=
s found to have=20

penetrated the heart, a large blood-vessel, or one of the viscera; or, on t=
he other hand, if the stab-

wound was found to be superficial and not penetrating, and the wound in the=
 shoulder had=20

suppurated and caused septic=C3=A6mia.  In either or any case, everything w=
ould depend upon the=20

evidence furnished by the medical witness. His knowledge and judgment are r=
equired to=20

distinguish the guilty from the innocent.  Again, sometimes death may appea=
r to be equally the=20

result of either or both wounds, in which case, as far as the medical evide=
nce goes, both=20

assailants would be liable to the charge of manslaughter. Or the second wou=
nd may be accidental=20

or suicidal, and again the question would arise as to the cause of death. A=
 case illustrating this is=20

told by Taylor[630] substantially as follows: A grocer=E2=80=99s assistant =
pursued a thief, who had stolen=20

from a cart, into a coal-shed, where he was stabbed twice in the abdomen. T=
he larger wound=20

suppurated, the smaller wound healed up, and the man died of peritonitis. O=
n post-mortem=20

examination the suppurating wound was found not to involve a vital part, wh=
ile the small healed=20

wound had wounded the liver and gall bladder and had set up the fatal perit=
onitis. The large=20

suppurating wound had apparently been inflicted purposely; the fatal wound,=
 directed upward and=20

backward, might have been accidental by the=20


_
detractors, who by false tales endeavour to set thy heart against us, but l=
ove us, as a son should=20

love a father, and then the disturbances in thy kingdom, raised up by thy p=
ersecutions against our=20

holy church, would cease.  =E2=80=98Thou knowest well, glorious prince, and=
 hast also heard from public=20

report, how constantly and diligently we have laboured to restore union to =
the church; and the=20

advances we have made, in order to obtain peace, toward those who have fool=
ishly encouraged=20

the unfortunate schism, by claiming the right of enjoying the holy see, and=
 more particularly toward=20

Angelo deceased rushing upon the knife held more or less in self-defence. T=
he case never came=20

to trial, as the assailant was never found, but it can be readily imagined =
what complications might=20

have arisen.  Furthermore, the wounded person may have taken poison or been=
 subsequently ill-

treated, and he may have died from these causes rather than the injury. But=
 the question arises as=20

to whether the wound was necessarily the cause of death. Here, in order to =
exculpate the=20

assailant, the supervening disease or maltreatment must be such as to accou=
nt for sudden or=20

rapid death under the symptoms=20


_
adversary to the church. He, however, refuses to perform the promises he ha=
d made in various=20

places to resign his pretensions, and prolongs the division in the holy chu=
rch under frivolous and=20

false pretences. It is, however, notorious, and cannot be denied, that it h=
as not been owing to any=20

fault in us that peace has not been given to the church, and all cause for =
schism annihilated.=20

=E2=80=98Notwithstanding this, there are some, we hear, who are very busy i=
n their endeavours to defame=20

us to thee, and to lessen, in as much as they can, the purity of our good f=
ame. Others, we learn,=20

are weakening thy devotion, and that of the princes of thy blood, by unjust=
ly blaming us, and=20

charging us most falsely with want of diligence in re-establishing the unio=
n of the holy church.  =E2=80=98In=20

truth, such persons should be answered by stating the real facts, which wou=
ld destroy their fictions=20

and falsehoods; and we believe that they have been the cause why we have no=
t received any=20

thing in our treasury from thy kingdom for the space of two years, an edict=
 having been issued=20

from thy court, which has deprived us of our rights, and we are no longer o=
beyed in thy realm. We=20

look, however, for consolation and assistance from thee; for thy predecesso=
rs, in times past, have=20

laboured to destroy the schisms and errors in the church, and to preserve p=
eace and union. But=20

some in thy kingdom have lately rebelled against the holy see, by appealing=
 from us, against the=20

constitutions of the canon,=E2=80=94and they have been permitted to spread =
abroad divers errors,=20

contrary to the purity of true religion.  =E2=80=98In addition to what we h=
ave stated, we have been much hurt=20

and affected by the conduct of thy ambassadors in this preceded death.  =3D=
Was Death Due to=20

Natural Causes?=3D Again, the injury may be admitted, but it may be claimed=
 that death is due to=20

natural causes. It is not unusual for wounded persons to die from natural c=
auses, though the case=20

may appear otherwise to laymen. This is often seen with suicidal wounds, es=
pecially those inflicted=20

during the delirium of a disease, or the disease may supervene later and ca=
use death without=20

relation to the wound. Where the wound was inflicted by another, accurate d=
iscrimination is=20

especially important in order to save the accused from imprisonment under f=
alse accusation and=20

consequent loss of character. A careful examination is the only way to dete=
rmine such cases,=20

which depend therefore on the medical testimony.  Again, the question may a=
rise as between=20

DEATH FROM WOUNDS OR LATENT DISEASE, the wound perhaps being admitted, but =
death=20

being attributed to latent disease. Here a close attention to symptoms and =
a careful post-mortem=20

examination can alone decide. A man may die from the rupture of an aneurism=
, from an apoplexy=20

or some other morbid condition after receiving a severe wound. Or a man wit=
h a hernia may=20

receive a blow upon it causing a rupture of the contained intestine followe=
d by peritonitis and=20

death, or the recipient of a blow may have a calculus in the kidney which m=
ay perforate a blood-

vessel or the kidney tissue and set up a fatal hemorrhage as the result of =
a blow.  Thus, medically=20

speaking, the result of the injury is unusual and unexpected, and due to an=
 abnormal or unhealthy=20

state of body of the wounded person.  If it can be clearly shown by the med=
ical testimony that=20

death was due to the above or any other latent diseases, the=20


_
very dear sons Jean de Ch=C3=A2teau-Morant and Jean de Coursen, noble men a=
nd thy ambassadors,=20

have come to us from thee, and brought us letters sealed with thy seal, by =
which thou makest=20

known to us, that if by the feast of Ascension next coming, union be not es=
tablished throughout=20

our holy church, and one pope or pastor of that church be elected, thyself,=
 the clergy, nobles and=20

people of thy realm, and of the duchy of Guienne, will assailant may be les=
sened or removed. The=20

law looks to this point and is lenient in its punishment in the absence of =
malice on the part of the=20

assailant. The crime is still manslaughter and may even be murder if the as=
sailant was actuated by=20

malice and the abnormal or unhealthy state of the body of the victim was ta=
ken advantage of.=20

Generally there is no intention of murder, but the nature of the wound and =
the means of infliction=20
