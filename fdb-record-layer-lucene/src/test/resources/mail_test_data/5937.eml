discovered the duality of Manas. The Divine Ego tends with its point upwards towards Buddhi, and 

the human Ego gravitates downwards, immersed in Matter, connected with its higher, subjective 

half only by the Antahkarana. As its derivation suggests, this is the only connecting link during life 

between the two minds--the higher consciousness of the Ego and the human intelligence of the 

lower mind.  To understand this abstruse metaphysical doctrine fully and correctly, one has to be 

thoroughly impressed with an idea, which I have in vain endeavoured to impart to Theosophists at 

large, namely, the great axiomatic truth that the only eternal and living Reality is that which the 

Hindus call Paramatma and Parabrahman. This is the one ever-existing Root Essence, immutable 

and unknowable to our physical senses, but manifest and clearly perceptible to our spiritual 

natures. Once imbued with that basic idea and the further conception that if It is omnipresent, 

universal and eternal, like abstract Space itself, we must have emanated from It and we must, 

some day, return into It, and all the rest becomes easy.  If so, then it stands to reason that life and 

death, good and evil, past and future, are all empty words, or at best, figures of speech. If the 

objective Universe  The people, kept back by Louvieres, had not made another step forward; but 

the awful murmuring, which indicates an angry people, continued.  The queen had written, "The 

keeper of the prison at Saint Germain will set Councillor Broussel at liberty;" and she had signed it. 

The coadjutor, whose eyes devoured her slightest movements, seized the paper immediately the 

signature had been affixed to it, returned to the window and waved it in his hand.  "This is the 

order," he said.  All Paris seemed to shout with joy, and then the air resounded with the cries of 

"Long live Broussel!" "Long live the coadjutor!"  "Long live the queen!" cried De Gondy; but the 

cries which replied to his were poor and few, and perhaps he had but uttered it to make Anne of 

Austria sensible of her weakness.  "And now that you have obtained what you want, go," said she, 

"Monsieur de Gondy."  "Whenever her majesty has need of me," replied the coadjutor, bowing, 

"her majesty knows I am at her command."  "Ah, cursed priest!" cried Anne, when he had retired, 

stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door, "one day I will make you drink the dregs of the 

atrocious gall you have poured out on me to-day."  Mazarin wished to approach her. "Leave me!" 

she exclaimed; "you are not a man!" and she

beginning and finitude, then both life and death must also be aspects and illusions. They are 

changes of state, in fact, and no more. Real life is in the spiritual consciousness of that life, _in a 

conscious existence in Spirit, not Matter_; and real death is the limited perception of life, the 

impossibility of sensing conscious or even individual existence outside of form, or  "It is you who 

are not a woman," muttered Mazarin.  Then, after a moment of reverie, he remembered where he 

had left D'Artagnan and Porthos and that they must have overheard everything. He knit his brows 

and went direct to the tapestry, which he pushed aside. The closet was empty.  At the queen's last 

word, D'Artagnan had dragged Porthos into the gallery. Thither Mazarin went

possibility of conscious life divorced from Matter and brain-substance, are _dead units_. The 

words of Paul, an Initiate, become comprehensible. "Ye are dead, and your _life_ is hid with Christ 

in God;" which is to say: Ye are personally dead matter, unconscious of its own spiritual essence, 

and your real life is hid with your Divine Ego (Christos) in, or walking up and down.  "Why did you 

leave the closet, Monsieur d'Artagnan?" asked the cardinal.  "Because," replied D'Artagnan, "the 

queen desired every one to leave and I thought that this command was intended for us as well as 

for the rest."  "And you have been here since----"  "About a quarter of an hour," said D'Artagnan, 

motioning to Porthos not to

with, God (Atma); now has it departed from you, ye soulless people. Speaking on Esoteric lines, 

every irrevocably materialistic person is a _dead Man_, a living automaton, in spite of his being 

endowed with great brain power. Listen to what Aryasangha says, stating the same fact:       That 

which is neither Spirit nor Matter, neither Light nor     Darkness, but is verily the container and root 

of these, that thou     art. The Root projects at every  Mazarin saw the sign and remained 

convinced that D'Artagnan had seen and heard everything; but he was pleased with his falsehood. 

"Decidedly, Monsieur d'Artagnan, you are the man I have been seeking. You may reckon upon me 

and so may your friend." Then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile, he re-

entered his closet more calmly, for on the departure of De Gondy the uproar had ceased as 

though by enchantment.     49. Misfortune
