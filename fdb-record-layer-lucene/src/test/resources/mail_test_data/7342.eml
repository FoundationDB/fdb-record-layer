t countries.  CHAPTER 85 They say there is a skeleton in every house; it ma=
y be doubted. What is more certain are the sorrow and perplexity which some=
times, without a warning and preparation, suddenly fall _
surface; upon this he writes in large characters, with thick glutinous ink,=
 a verse or verses from the=20

Koran that he considers applicable to the case; this completed, he washes o=
ff the holy quotation,=20

and converts it into a potation by the addition of a little water; this is =
swallowed in perfect faith by=20

the patient, who in return pays a fee according to the demand of the Faky. =
Of course it cannot be=20

supposed that this effects a cure, or that it is in any way superior to the=
 prescriptions of a=20

thorough-bred English doctor; the only advantage possessed by the system is=
 complete=20

innocence, in which it may perhaps claim superiority. If no good result is =
attained by the first holy=20

dose, the patient returns with undiminished confidence, and the prescriptio=
n is repeated as "the=20

draught as before," well known to the physic-drinkers of England, and in li=
ke manner attended with=20

the bill. The fakeers make a considerable amount by this simple practice, a=
nd they add to their=20

small earnings by the sale of verses of the Koran as talismans.  As few peo=
ple can read or write,=20

there is an air of mystery in the art of writing which much enhances the va=
lue of a scrap of paper=20

upon which is written a verse from the Koran. A few piastres are willingly =
expended in the=20

purchase of such talismans, which are carefully and very neatly sewn into s=
mall envelopes of=20

leather, and are worn by all people, being handed down from father to son. =
 The Arabs are=20

especially fond of relics; thus, upon the return from a pilgrimage to Mecca=
, the "hadji," or pilgrim, is=20

certain to have purchased from some religious Faky of the sacred shrine eit=
her a few square=20

inches of cloth, or some such trifle, that belonged to the prophet Mahomet.=
 This is exhibited to his=20

friends and strangers as a wonderful spell against some particular malady, =
and it is handed about=20

and received with extreme reverence by the assembled crowd. I once formed o=
ne of a circle when=20

a pilgrim returned to his native village: we sat in a considerable number u=
pon the ground, while he=20

drew from his bosom a leather envelope, suspended from his neck, from which=
 he produced a=20

piece of extremely greasy woollen cloth, about three inches square, the ori=
ginal colour of which it=20

would have been impossible to guess. This was a piece of Mahomet's garment,=
 but what portion=20

he could not say. The pilgrim had paid largely for this blessed relic, and =
it was passed round our=20

circle from hand to hand, after having first been kissed by the proprietor,=
 who raised it to the crown=20

of his head, which he touched speaks, it is not merely the voice of the fat=
hers of the world; it=20

declares what =E2=80=98it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us.=E2=
=80=99=E2=80=9D  There was a pause, and then=20

Lothair remarked: =E2=80=9CYou said, air, that the council would show to th=
e civil powers of the Christian=20

world the inevitable future they are preparing for themselves?=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CEven so. Now mark this, my child.=20

At the Council of Trent the Christian powers were represented, and properly=
 so. Their seats will be=20

empty at the Council of the Vatican. What does that mean? The separation be=
tween Church and=20

State, talked of for a long time, now demonstrated. And what does separatio=
n between Church=20

and State mean? That society is no longer consecrated. The civil government=
s of the world no=20

longer profess to be Catholic. The faithful indeed among their subjects wil=
l be represented at the=20

council by their pastors, but the civil powers have separated themselves fr=
om the Church; either=20

by royal edict, or legislative enactment, or revolutionary changes, they ha=
ve abolished the legal=20

status of the Catholic Church within their territory. It is not their choic=
e; they are urged on by an=20

invisible power that is anti-Christian, and which is the true, natural, and=
 implacable enemy of the=20

one visible and universal Church. The coming anarchy is called progress, be=
cause it advances=20

along the line of departure from the old Christian order of the world. Chri=
stendom was the offspring=20

of the Christian family, and the foundation of the Christian family is the =
sacrament of matrimony,=20



the sprit of all domestic and public morals. The anti-Christian societies a=
re opposed to the principle=20

of home. When they have destroyed the hearth, the morality of society will =
perish. A settlement in=20

the foundations may be slow in sinking, but it brings all down at last. The=
 next step in de-

Christianizing the political life of nations is to establish national educa=
tion without Christianity. This=20

is systematically aimed at wherever the revolution has its way. The period =
and policy of Julian are=20

returning. Some think this bodes ill for the Church; no, it is the State th=
at will suffer. The secret=20

societies are hurrying the civil governments of the world, and mostly the g=
overnments who=20

disbelieve in their existence, to the brink of a precipice, over which mona=
rchies, and law, and civil=20

order, will ultimately fall and perish together.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen al=
l is hopeless,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CTo human=20

speculation,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal; =E2=80=9Cbut none can fathom the m=
ysteries of Divine interposition. This=20

gh a similar=20

performance, and as ophthalmia and other diseases of the eyes were extremel=
y prevalent, several=20

of the party had eyes that had not the brightness of the gazelle's; neverth=
eless, these resolved to=20

invite the schismatic priesthoods to attend it, and labor to bring about th=
e unity of Christendom. He=20

will send an ambassador to the patriarch of the heresy of Photius, which is=
 called the Greek=20

Church. He will approach Lambeth. I have little hope of the latter,=20

been wiped by the holy cloth. How many eyes this same piece of cloth had wi=
ped it would be=20

impossible to say, but such facts are sufficient to prove the danger of hol=
y relics, that are=20

inoculators of all manner of contagious diseases.  I believe in holy shrine=
s as the pest spots of the=20

world. We generally have experienced in Western Europe that all violent epi=
demics arrive from the=20

East. The great breadth of the Atlantic boundary would naturally protect us=
 from the West, but=20

infectious disorders, such as plague, cholera, small-pox, &c. may be genera=
lly tracked throughout=20

their gradations from their original nests; those nests are in the East, wh=
ere the heat of the climate=20

acting upon the filth of semi-savage communities engenders pestilence.  The=
 holy places of both=20

Christians and Mahometans are the receptacles for the masses of people of a=
ll nations and=20

classes who have arrived from all points of the compass; the greater number=
 of such people are of=20

poor estate; many, who have toiled on foot from immense distances, sufferin=
g from more than one=20

of the Anglican bishops who revere the memory and example of Laud. But I by=
 no means despair=20

of your communion being present in some form at the council. There are true=
 spirits at Oxford who=20

sigh for unity. They will form, I hope, a considerable deputation; but, as =
not yet being prelates, they=20

cannot take their seats formally in the council, I wish, in order to increa=
se and assert their=20

influence, that they should be accompanied by a band of powerful laymen, wh=
o shall represent the=20

pious and pure mind of England=E2=80=94the coming guardians of the land in =
the dark hour that may be at=20

hand. Considering your previous knowledge of Rome, your acquaintance with i=
ts eminent men and=20

its language, and considering too, as I well know, that the Holy Father loo=
ks to you as one marked=20

out by Providence to assert the truth, it would please me=E2=80=94and, trus=
t me, it would be wise in=20

you=E2=80=94were you to visit Rome on this sublime occasion, and perhaps pu=
t your mark on the world=E2=80=99s=20

fatigue, and bringing with them not only the diseases of their own remote c=
ountries, but arriving in=20

that weak state that courts the attack of any epidemic. Thus crowded togeth=
er, with a scarcity of=20

provisions, a want of water, and no possibility of cleanliness, after a pau=
se.  =E2=80=9CNot too long for=20

preparation,=E2=80=9D replied the cardinal. =E2=80=9CFrom this hour, until =
its assembling, the pulse of humanity will=20

throb. Even at this hour they are speaking of the same matters as ourselves=
 alike on the=20

Euphrates and the St. Lawrence. The=20


_
months, in a camp of dirty pilgrims, without any attempt at drainage, an ac=
cumulation of filth takes=20

place that generates either cholera or typhus; the latter, in its most mali=
gnant form, appears as the=20

dreaded "plague." Should such an epidemic attack the mass of pilgrims debil=
itated by the want of=20

nourishing food, and exhausted by their fatiguing march, it runs riot like =
a fire among combustibles,=20

and the loss of conferring with the bishops, and awakening them to the occa=
sion. There is a party=20

among them narrow-minded and local, the effects of their education. There o=
ught not to be an Irish=20

priest who was not brought up at the Propaganda. You know that admirable in=
stitution. We had=20

some happy hours at Rome together=E2=80=94may we soon repeat them! You were=
 very unwell there;=20

next time you will judge of Rome in health and vigor.=E2=80=9D=20
