Grays Harbor,=20

unless approaching from the ocean, means a trip through the wide fertile va=
lley of the Chehalis=20

river, either by auto or over one of the three transcontinental railroads t=
hat serve it. The entire=20

journey presents a panorama of pretty landscapes. The stream itself is cons=
picuous, tracing the=20

valley's boundary on one side and again on the other, as if choosing the mo=
st convenient course=20

to the sea. Sometimes it disappears from view, but its presence is still ma=
rked by clumps of=20

willows and cottonwoods protecting its banks, and again by some rustic brid=
ge where the highway=20

crosses.  [Illustration: SCENE ON LOWER GRAYS HARBOR.]  More generously the=
 beauties=20

unfold as the valley widens and the harbor is neared. Quaint towns are seen=
, including Oakville,=20

noted for large shipments of cascara bark; Elma, an industrial center; and =
Montesano, the county=20

seat and head of river navigation. Green meadows, wooded slopes, and cultiv=
ated farms on both=20

sides of the river absorb the attention until Cosmopolis, Aberdeen, and Hoq=
uiam, close by the=20

harbor, are reached. These cities have experienced a remarkable growth with=
in the past fourteen=20

years. Aberdeen and Hoquiam have now a combined population of 29,000 in pla=
ce of 6,355, the=20

census returns of 1900. Thoroughly cosmopolitan, they contain the homes of =
some of the=20

wealthiest men in the state.  [Illustration: MT. ST. HELENS AND SPIRIT LAKE=

VIEWS.]  Such development has been due largely to the importance of the lum=
ber industry which=20

in this section of the state has assumed large proportions. The ravenous mi=
lls, the capacious=20

yards, and the huge vessels loading for foreign ports are common sights wit=
hin the cities. Farther=20

away in the logging camps the agility of the lumberjack is exhibited as he =
lays low the giants of the=20

forest and trims the logs ready for the mills.  The harbor may be most thor=
oughly appreciated by=20

taking a ride upon its waters. Regular steamers make the round trip each da=
y, stopping at many=20

points of interest, both in the north and the south bay, including the Nort=
h Jetty under construction=20

by the United States government, Westport, where the life saving station an=
d the wireless=20

telegraph station are located, and Bay City, one of the largest whaling sta=
tions in the northwest.=20

On the same trip the clam and crab fisheries may be seen. At the week end i=
t is pleasant to get off=20

at Westport and visit Cohasset Beach, there to enjoy the modern social past=
imes that engage the=20

evenings of the summer dwellers.  Pacific Beach, Moclips, and a number of o=
ther ocean resorts=20

near the terminus of the Northern Pacific, also deserve visits; while those=
 desiring more strenuous=20

exercise can make profitable excursions into the wild Olympic region, explo=
ring the forested hills,=20

visiting the oil prospects, or hunting and fishing.  Splendid highways lead=
 in different directions. In=20

Chehalis county alone are 325 miles of gravel roads, every part of which pa=
sses near interesting=20

scenes. One road extends to the south of the harbor and another to the beac=
h resorts at the north.=20

The Olympic Highway, one of the state primary highways, leads east to the S=
ound country, and=20

northward up the Humptulips Valley, through the big timber to Lake Quiniaul=
t, located in the midst=20

of grand solitude on the edge of the Quiniault Indian Reservation, making t=
his lake a handy resort=20

for the people living near Grays Harbor. Those who take the trip should pla=
n their return so as to=20

include a ride down the Quiniault River in Indian canoes. The Mountaineers =
who returned this way=20

from Mount Olympus in 1913, pronounced it the best part of the entire outin=
g:  "The trip down the=20

Quiniault river with its manifold beauties and experiences beggars descript=
ion--the swift current,=20



the whirling eddies, the deep, dark-green water, trout leaping into the air=
 to catch the flying insects,=20

the banks clothed with magnificent forests, log jams through which or under=
 which we passed,=20

animated branches marking the rhythmic motion of the current, the floating =
canoes gliding into the=20

deeper, darker water to seek the current that hurried them on and ever on t=
o the ocean. The=20

Indians skillfully guided the little craft through the dangerous places, th=
en settled back to rest until=20

the next test of skill or strength was necessary, in the meantime relating =
bits of history or legends=20

which explained names or some natural phenomenon. The boom of the surf anno=
unced the end of=20

the journey. As the Mountaineers left the canoes on the beach at Taholah, i=
t was agreed that the=20

trip down the Quiniault marked the red-letter day of the 1913 the Zoo. To e=
scort little Fay about=20

London was always rather an ordeal to anyone of a retiring disposition. She=
 was so fearless, so=20

interested in her fellow-creatures, and so ready at all times and in all pl=
aces to enter into=20

conversation with absolute strangers, preferably men, that embarrassing sit=
uations were almost=20

inevitable; and her speech, high and clear and carrying--in spite of the mi=
ssing "r"--rendered it=20

rarely possible to hope people did not understand what she said.  They went=
 by the Metropolitan=20

to Baker Street and sat on one of the small seats at right angles to the wi=
ndows, and a gentleman=20

wearing a very shiny top-hat sat down opposite to them.  He looked at littl=
e Fay; little Fay looked at=20

him and, smiling her adorable, confident smile, leant forward, remarking: "=
Sahib, you wear a very=20

high hat."  Instantly the eyes of all the neighbouring passengers were fixe=
d upon the hat and its=20

owner. His, however, were only for the very small lady that faced him; the =
small lady in a close=20

white bonnet and bewitching curls that bobbed and fluttered in the swaying =
of the train.  He took=20

off the immaculate topper and held it out towards her. "There," he said, "w=
ould you like to look at=20

it?"  Fay carefully rubbed it the wrong way with a tentative woolly-gloved =
finger. "Plitty, high hat,"=20

she cooed. "Can plitty little Fay have it to keep?"  But the gentleman's ad=
miration did not carry him=20

as far as this. Somewhat hastily he withdrew his hat, smoothed it (it had j=
ust been ironed) and=20

placed it on his head again. Then he became aware of the smiling faces and =
concentrated gaze of=20

his neighbours; also, that the attractive round face that had given him so =
much pleasure had=20

exchanged its captivating smile for a pathetic melancholy that even promise=
d tears. He turned=20

extremely red and escaped at the next station. Whereupon ungrateful little =
Fay, who had never=20

had the slightest intention of crying, remarked loftily: "Tahsome man dawn.=
"  When at last they=20

reached the Zoo Meg took it upon herself to remonstrate with her younger ch=
arge.  "You mustn't=20

ask strangers for things, dear; you really mustn't--not in the street or in=
 the train."  "What for?"=20

asked Fay. She nearly always said, "What for" when she meant "Why"; and it =
was as hard-worked=20

a phrase as "What nelse?"  "Because people don't do it, you know."  "They d=
o--I've heard 'em."=20

"Well, beggars perhaps, but not nice little girls."  "Do nasty little girls=
?"  "_Only_ nasty little girls=20

would do it, I think."  Fay pondered this for a minute, then in a regretful=
ly reflective voice she said=20

sadly: "Vat was a nasty, gleedy sahib in a tlain."  "Not at all," Meg argue=
d, struggling with her=20

mirth. "How would you have liked it if he'd asked you to give him your bonn=
et 'to keep'?"  Little Fay=20

hastily put up her hands to her head to be sure her bonnet was in its place=
, then she inquired with=20

great interest: "What's 'is place, deah Med?"  "Deah Med" soon found hersel=
f followed round by a=20

small crowd of other sight-seers who waited for and greeted little Fay's un=
ceasing comments with=20

joyful appreciation. Such popular publicity was not at all to Meg's taste, =
and although the afternoon=20

was extremely cold her cheeks never ceased to burn till she got the childre=
n safely back to the flat=20



again. Tony was gloomy and taciturn. Nobody took the slightest notice of hi=
m. Weather that=20

seemed to brace his sister to the most energetic gaiety only made him feel =
torpid and miserable.=20

He was not naughty, merely apathetic, uninterested, and consequently uninte=
resting. Meg thought=20

he might be homesick and sad about Ayah, and was very kind and gentle, but =
her advances met=20

with no response.  By this time Tony was sure of his aunt, but he had by no=
 means made up his=20

mind about Meg.  When they got back to Kensington Meg joyously handed over =
the children to=20

Jan while she retired to her room to array herself in her uniform. She was =
to "take over" from that=20

moment, and approached her new sphere with high seriousness and an intense =
desire to be, as=20

she put it, "a wild success."  For weeks she had been reading the publicati=
ons of the P. N. E. U.=20

and the "Child-Study Society," to say nothing of Manuals upon "Infant Hygie=
ne," "The Montessori=20

Method" and "The Formation of Character." Sympathy and Insight, Duty and Di=
scipline, Self-

Control and Obedience, Regularity and Concentration of Effort--all with the=
 largest capitals--were=20

to be her watchwords. And she buttoned on her well-fitting white linen apro=
n (newest and most=20

approved hospital pattern, which she had been obliged to make herself, for =
she could buy nothing=20

small enough) in a spirit of dedication as sincere as that imbuing any cand=
idate for Holy Orders.=20

Then, almost breathlessly, she put her cap upon her flaming head and survey=
ed the general effect=20

in the long glass.  Yes, it was all very=20

WILLAPA BAY.  [Illustration: TWO PATRIARCHS--ONE 65 FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE.]=
  The=20

water area of this bay is 100 square miles, composed of two sections, one e=
xtending southward=20

and separated from the ocean by a long narrow peninsula, nowhere more than =
two miles in width,=20

and the other reaching eastward to South Bend and Raymond. Into it flows Wi=
llapa river, besides=20

other short but swift mountain streams teeming with trout and other game fi=
sh. The bar is about a=20

mile wide and the waters covering it 28 1/2 feet deep at low tide, thus ena=
bling sea-going vessels=20

to cross without the aid of tugs--a great advantage to ocean liners and big=
 lumber schooners,=20

which may be seen almost any day either lying at the docks or loaded to the=
 gunwale passing out=20

to sea.  The southern arm approaches within three miles of the Columbia Riv=
er. People in Pacific=20

County say that Uncle Sam plans to dig a canal through this narrow strip so=
 that vessels may=20

enter the river by way of Willapa Bay and avoid the Columbia bar, kept open=
 by jetties built at=20

enormous expense.  [Illustration: SURF ON WASHINGTON COAST  Photo by Asahel=
 Curtis.]=20

The cities of Raymond and South Bend are other examples of what lumbering a=
nd fishing have=20

done for Washington municipalities. Where a few years ago was nothing but a=
 wilderness, known=20

only to the Indians or an occasional fisherman, are now busy marts with ext=
ensive waterfront=20

factory sites. Pretty roads start from these cities and wind along the harb=
or front or penetrate the=20

interior. Excursions by water may be made to Bay Center and Tokeland, summe=
r resorts and=20

fishing stations. Crab and clam fisheries and the oyster beds may be seen h=
ere to advantage,=20

Tokeland being the place where eastern oysters were first transplanted for =
mercantile purposes.=20

South Bend and Raymond are also starting points for the North Beach ocean r=
esorts. On this trip=20

one gets a full view of the bay, and the ocean surf tumbling over the bar. =
At Nahcotta, a pretty=20

oyster village, all passengers are transferred to the O.-W. R. & N. train b=
ound for Ilwaco and=20

Megler, whence regular steamers cross to Astoria. This train makes frequent=
 stops, permitting=20

close scrutiny of the attractive summer cottages that face the boundless oc=
ean constantly visible=20

on the right.  Located at almost the southern extremity of the peninsula is=
 the quaint town of=20

Ilwaco, overlooking the Columbia bar. Near by are the most extensive cranbe=
rry marshes in the=20

state. Another attraction is "North Head," most southwesterly point in the =
state of Washington,=20

where an unobstructed view of the ocean is obtained. From this point may be=
 seen the waters of=20

the Columbia mixing with the ocean, "Tillamook Head" in Oregon, the light h=
ouse, the life-saving=20

station, Fort Canby, the wireless station, and the "Seal Rocks," where hund=
reds of sea lions are=20

usually sunning themselves.  Instead of returning by the same route, the Co=
lumbia River may be=20

chosen to Kalama, whence the Sound Country may be quickly reached by the Pa=
cific Highway or=20

by rail. Every tourist should make at least one visit to the Harbor Country=
 and see the ocean from=20

the southwest corner of the state.  [Illustration: MOUNT RAINIER REFLECTED =

MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK            "What vastness and sublimity        =
    Were spread=20

before our eager gaze!            What wild and varied scenery!            =
What pictures for the poets=20

lays!"]   One day, late in summer, I was sitting upon a commanding promonto=
ry nearly 7,000 feet=20

in altitude, entranced by a panoramic view most wonderful to behold. The sk=
y was clear, the sun's=20

warm rays were unobstructed, and the air I breathed pure as the nectar of h=
eaven. Only five hours=20

before I had left the city of Tacoma and a little earlier Seattle--two grea=
t cities throbbing with the=20

activities of nearly a half million people engaged in manufacturing and mer=
cantile pursuits.  Just=20



beyond the foothills visible towards the west were the green valleys in whi=
ch these metropolitan=20

centers lay--the nearest only forty miles distant by an air line, close to =
the waters of Puget Sound.=20

Yet here, almost in sight of them, I was enjoying a quietude known only to =
the haunts of nature.=20

More than seven thousand feet above me towered the majestic dome of the sec=
ond highest=20

pinnacle in the United States, reserving observation to the north until its=
 summit should be=20

reached, while far toward the east and the south extended range upon range =
of mountain peaks,=20

like an army of giants gathered around their chief. Here and there among th=
em appeared the sub-

chiefs, Adams and St. Helens in Washington; and Hood, Jefferson, and the Th=
ree Sisters, far=20

beyond, in Oregon. Between their serrated ranks darker shadows marked the d=
eep canyons=20

where grows some of the choicest timber in the state.  Near by crawled the =
huge glacial bodies=20

gnawing their way down frock--was it a trifle short? Yet the little feet in=
 the low-heeled shoes were=20

neat as the ankles above them were slim, and one needed a short skirt for "=
working about."=20

Perhaps there _was_ a touch of musical comedy about her appearance, but tha=
t was merely=20

because she was so small and the cap, a muslin cap of a Quakerish shape, di=
stinctly becoming.=20

Well, there was no reason why she should want to look hideous. She would no=
t be less capable=20

because she was pleasing to the eye.  She seized her flannel apron from the=
 bed where she had=20

placed it ready before she went out, and with one last lingering look at he=
rself went swiftly to her=20

new duties.  Tea passed peacefully enough, though Fay asked embarrassing qu=
estions, such as=20

"Why you wear suts a funny hat?"  "Because I'm an ayah," Meg answered quick=
ly.  "Ayahs don't=20

wear zose kind of hats."  "English ayahs do, and I'm going to be your ayah,=
 you know."  Fay=20

considered Meg for a minute. "No," she said, shaking her head. "_No._"  "Ha=
ve another sponge-

finger," Jan suggested diplomatically, handing the dish to her niece, and t=
he danger was averted.=20

They played games with the children after tea and all went well till bed-ti=
me. Meg had begged Jan=20

to leave them entirely to her, and with considerable misgiving she had seen=
 Meg marshal the=20

children to the bathroom and shut the door. Tony was asked as a favour to g=
o too this first evening=20

without Ayah, lest little Fay should feel lonely. It was queer, Jan reflect=
ed when left alone in the=20

drawing-room, how she seemed to turn to the taciturn Tony for help where he=
r obstreperous niece=20

was concerned. Over and over again Tony had intervened and successfully pre=
vented a storm.=20

Meg turned on the bath and began to undress little Fay. She bore this with =
comparative=20

meekness, but when all her garments had been removed she slipped from Meg's=
 knees and,=20

standing squarely on the floor, announced:  "I want my own Ayah. Engliss Ay=
ah not wass me.=20

Own Ayah muss come bat."  "She can't, my darling; she's gone to other littl=
e girls, you know--we=20

told you many days ago."  "She muss come bat--'_jaldi_,'" shouted Fay--"jal=
di" being Hindustani=20

for "quickly."  Meg sighed. "I'm afraid she can't do that. Come, my preciou=
s, and let me bathe you;=20

you'll get cold standing there."  With a quick movement Meg seized the plum=
p, round body. She=20

was muscular though so small, and in spite of little Fay's opposition she l=
ifted her into the bath.=20

She felt Tony pull at her skirts and say something, but was too busy to pay=
 attention.  Little Fay=20

was in the bath sure enough, but to wash her was quite another matter. You =
may lead a sturdy=20

infant of three to the water in a fixed bath, but no power on earth can was=
h that infant if it doesn't=20

choose. Fay screamed and struggled and wriggled and kicked, finally slippin=
g right under the=20

water, which frightened her dreadfully; she lost her breath for one second,=
 only to give forth ear-

splitting yells the next. She was slippery as a trout and strong as a leapi=
ng salmon.  Jan could=20



bear it no longer and came in. Meg had succeeded in lifting the terrified b=
aby out of the bath, and=20

she stood on the square of cork defying the "Engliss Ayah," wet from her to=
pmost curl to her pink=20

toes, but wholly unwashed.  Tony ran to Jan and under all the din contrived=
 to say: "It's the big=20

bath; she's frightened. Ayah never put her in the big bath."  Meg had forgo=
tten this. The little tin=20

bath they had brought from India for the voyage stood in a corner.  It was =
filled, while Fay,=20

wrapped in a Turkish towel, sobbed more quietly, ejaculating between the gu=
rgles: "Nasty hat,=20

nasty Engliss Ayah. I want my own deah Ayah!"  When the bath was ready poor=
 Meg again=20

approached little Fay, but Fay would have none of her.  "No," she wailed, "=
Engliss Ayah in nasty=20

hat _not_ wass me. Tony wass me, _deah_ Tony."  She held out her arms to he=
r brother, who=20

promptly received her in his.  "You'd better let me," he said to the anxiou=
s young women. "We'll=20

never get her finished else."  So it ended in Tony's being arrayed in the f=
lannel apron which, tied=20

under his arm-pits, was not so greatly too long. With his sleeves turned up=
 he washed his small=20

sister with thoroughness and despatch, pointing out somewhat proudly that h=
e "went into all the=20

corners."  [Illustration: He washed his small sister with thoroughness and =
despatch, pointing out ...=20

that he "went into all the corners."]  The washing-glove was very large on =
Tony's little hand, and=20

he used a tremendous lot of soap--but Fay became all smiles and amiability =
during the process.=20

Meg and Jan had tears in their eyes as they watched the quaint spectacle. T=
here was something=20

poignantly pathetic in the clinging together of these two small wayfarers i=
n a strange country, so=20

far from all they had known and shared in their short experience.  Meg's "n=
asty hat" was rakishly=20

askew upon her red curls, for Fay had frequently grabbed at it in her rage,=
 and the beautiful green=20

out by these superhuman agencies eons before. Barely distinguishable was th=
e road by which I=20

had made the circuitous ascent, bending back and forth across the face of a=
n apparently=20

perpendicular wall, while the glacial streams glittering in the sunshine, r=
esembled huge serpents=20

lying in the profound hollows formed by the extending hills.  The hours spe=

region was only recently set aside as a National Park. Perhaps no other are=

so many and such varied natural wonders to the very doors of two great citi=

207,360 acres, or 324 square miles, of which 100 square was sopping wet.  "=
Engliss Ayah clying!"=20

Fay remarked surprisedly. "What for?"  "Because you wouldn't let me bathe y=
ou," said Meg=20

dismally. Her voice broke. She really was most upset. As it happened, she d=
id the only thing that=20

would have appealed to little Fay.  "Don't cly, deah Med," she said sweetly=
. "You sall dly me."  And=20

Meg, student of so many manuals, humbly and gratefully accepted the task.  =
It had taken exactly=20

an hour and a quarter to get Fay ready for bed. Indian Ayah used to do it i=
n fifteen minutes.=20
