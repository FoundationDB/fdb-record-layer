_Sthavaraka._ And I'll eat them.  _Sansthanaka._ I'll make you the chief of=
 all my shervants.=20

_Sthavaraka._ Master, I'll be the chief.  _Sansthanaka._ You only have to a=
ttend to what I shay.=20

_Sthavaraka._ Master, I will do anything, unless it be a sin.  P. 205.12]  =
_Sansthanaka._ There's a=20

period of comparative repose and, to some extent, of decline, but one in wh=
ich the principles of his=20

literary faith were maintained and pressed to new conclusions. His writings=
 include twelve satires=20

(of which the ninth, "A son Esprit," is the chief masterpiece); twelve epis=
tles (that to Racine being=20

pre-eminent); the literary-didactic poem, _L'Art Poetique_; a heroi-comical=
 epic, _Le Lutrin_;=20

miscellaneous shorter poems (among which may be noted the admirable epitaph=
 on Arnauld, and=20

an unhappy ode, _Sur la Prise de Namur_, 1693); and various critical studie=
s in prose, his=20

Lucianic dialogue _Les Heros de Roman_, satirising the extravagant novels n=
ot yet dismissed to=20

oblivion, and his somewhat truculent _Reflexions sur Longin_ being speciall=
y deserving of=20

attention. The satires preceded in date the epistles; of the former, the fi=
rst nine belong to the years=20

1660-67; the first nine of the epistles to the years 1669-77; three satires=
 and three epistles may be=20

described as belated. The year 1674 is memorable as that in which were publ=
ished _L'Art=20

Poetique_ and the first four _chants_ of _Le Lutrin_.  The genius of Boilea=
u was in a high degree=20

intellectual, animated by ideas; but it=20


_
_Sthavaraka._ Then speak, master.  _Sansthanaka._ Murder Vasantasena.  _Sth=
avaraka._ Oh,=20

master, be merciful! Unworthy as I am, I brought this worthy lady hither, b=
ecause she mistook this=20

bullock-cart for another.  _Sansthanaka._ You shlave, ain't I your mashter?=
  _Sthavaraka._ Master=20

of my body, not of my character. Be merciful, master, be merciful! I am afr=
aid.  _Sansthanaka._=20

You're my shlave. Who are you afraid of?  _Sthavaraka._ Of the other world,=
 master.=20

_Sansthanaka._ Who is thish "other world"?  _Sthavaraka._ Master, it is a r=
ewarder of=20

righteousness and sin.  _Sansthanaka._ What is the reward of righteoushness=
?  _Sthavaraka._ To=20

be like my master, with plenty of golden ornaments.  _Sansthanaka._ What is=
 the reward of shin?=20

_Sthavaraka._ To be like me, eating another man's bread. That is why I will=
 do no sin.=20

_Sansthanaka._ Sho you won't murder her? [_He beats him with all his might.=
_]  _Sthavaraka._=20

You may beat me, master. You may kill me, master. I will do no sin.      A =
luckless, lifelong slave=20

am I,     A slave I live, a slave I die;     But further woe I will not buy=
,       I will not, will not sin.=20

25  _Vasantasena._ Sir, I throw myself upon your protection.  _Courtier._ P=
ardon him, jackass!=20

Well done, Sthavaraka!      Does this poor, miserable slave     Seek virtue=
's meed beyond the=20

grave?     And is his lord indifferent?     Then why are not such creatures=
 sent     To instant hell,=20

whose sinful store     Grows great, who know not virtue more?              =
         26  [125.14. S.  And=20

again:      Ah, cruel, cruel is our fate,     And enters through the strait=
est gate;     Since he is slave,=20

and you are lord,     Since he does not enjoy your hoard,     Since you do =
not obey his word.=20

27  _Sansthanaka._ [_Aside._] The old jackal is afraid of a shin, and the "=
lifelong shlave" is afraid=20

absent from his verse. It is verse of the classical school, firm and clear,=
 but it addresses the ear=20

with a studied harmony, and what Boileau saw he could render into exact, de=
finite, and vivid=20

expression. His imagination was not in a large sense creative; he was wholl=
y lacking in tenderness=20

and sensibility; his feeling for external nature was no more than that of a=
 Parisian bourgeois who=20

enjoys for a day the repose of the fields; but for Paris itself, its variou=
s aspects, its life, its types, its=20

manners, he had the eye and the precise rendering of a realist in art; his =
faithful objective touch is=20

like that of a Dutch painter. As a moralist, he is not searching or profoun=
d; he saw too little of the=20

inner world of the heart, and knew too imperfectly its agitations. When, ho=
wever, he deals with=20

literature--and a just judgment in letters may almost be called an element =
in morals--all his=20

penetration and power become apparent.  To clear the ground for the new sch=
ool of nature, truth=20

and reason was Boileau's first task. It was a task which called for courage=
 and skill. The public=20

taste was still uncertain. Laboured and lifeless epics like Chapelain's _La=
 Pucelle_, petty=20

ingenuities in metre like those of Cotin, violence and over-emphasis, extra=
vagances of sentiment,=20

faded preciosities, inane pastoralisms, gross or vulgar burlesques, tragedi=
es languorous and=20

insipid, lyrics of pretended passion, affectations from the degenerate Ital=
ian literature, super-

subtleties from Spain--these had still their votaries. And the conduct of l=
ife and characters of men=20

of letters were often unworthy of the vocation they professed. "La haine d'=
un sot livre" was an=20

inspiration for Boileau, as it afterwards was for our English satirist Pope=
; and he felt deeply that=20

dignity of art is connected with dignity of character and rectitude of life=
--"Le vers se sent toujours=20

des bassesses de coeur."=20


_
I, the king's brother-in-law, an arishtocrat, a man? [_Aloud._] Well, sherv=
ant, you "lifelong shlave,"=20

you can go. Go to your room and resht and keep out of my way.  _Sthavaraka.=
_ Yes, master. [_To=20

Vasantasena._] Madam, I have no further power.                             =
                   [_Exit._=20

_Sansthanaka._ [_Girds up his loins._] Wait a minute, Vasantasena, wait a m=
inute. I want to=20

murder you.  _Courtier._ You will kill her the world of letters, and he str=
uck with force: it was a=20

needful duty, and one most effectively performed. Certain of the Epistles, =
which are written with=20

less pitiless severity and with a more accomplished mastery of verse, conti=
nue the work of the=20

Satires. From Horace he derived much, something from Juvenal, and something=
 from his=20

predecessor Regnier; but he had not the lightness nor the _bonhomie_ of Hor=
ace, nor his easy=20

and amiable=20


_
throat._]  _Sansthanaka._ [_Falls to the ground._] Shir, you 're murdering =
your mashter. [_He=20

loses consciousness, but recovers._]      I always fed him fat with meat,  =
   And gave him butter=20

too, to eat;     Now for the friend in need I search;     Why does he leave=
 me  In the _Art Poetique_=20

Boileau is constructive; he exhibits the true doctrine of literature, as he=
 conceived it. Granted=20

genius, fire, imagination--the gifts of heaven--what should be the self-imp=
osed discipline of a poet?=20

Above all, the cultivation of that power which=20


_
[_After reflection._] Good! I have an idea. The old jackal gave her a hint =
by shaking his head at=20

her. Sho I 'll shend him away, and then I 'll murder Vasantasena. That's th=
e idea. [_Aloud._] Shir, I=20

was born in a noble family as great as a wine-glass. How could I do that sh=
in I distinguishes false=20

from true, and aids every other faculty--the reason. "Nothing," declares Bo=
ileau, "is beautiful save=20

what is true;" nature is the model, the aim and end of art; reason and good=
 sense discern reality;=20

they test the fidelity of the artistic imitation of nature;=20
