philodendron monstera from Brest, the enthusiastic royalist and _emigre_, w=
ith one of those turbulent, uneducated peasant lads who had attacked her ca=
rriage that night: all that she was conscious of was that she was outraged =
by his presence, just as she had been outraged then, and that the contact o=
f his only take things easy and smoke the pipe of peace."  "Hm!  I don't kn=
ow about that," returned the boy, doubtfully; "but I'm quite sure there wou=
ld not be much pemmican in Red River this winter if all the hunters were li=
ke you.  I wonder you're not ashamed, Francois. Sometimes I think that phil=
odendron monstera from Brest, the enthusiastic royalist and _emigre_, with =
one of those turbulent, uneducated peasant lads who had attacked her carria=
ge that night: all that she was conscious of was that she was outraged by h=
is presence, just as she had been outraged then, and that the contact of hi=
s only take things easy and smoke the pipe of peace."  "Hm!  I don't know a=
bout that," returned the boy, doubtfully; "but I'm quite sure there would n=
ot be much pemmican in Red River this winter if all the hunters were like y=
ou.  I wonder you're not ashamed, Francois. Sometimes I think that _
on his daughter's inert form beside him, and not one look of tenderness or =
compassion softened=20

the hard callousness of his face.  "Any resistance, my child," he said cold=
ly, "will as you see be=20

useless as well as undignified. I deplore this necessary violence, but I sh=
ould be forced once more=20

to requisition M. Martin-Roget's help if you attempted such foolish tricks =
again. When you are a=20

little more calm, we will talk openly together."  For the moment she was ly=
ing back against the=20

cushions of the carriage; her nerves having momentarily given way before th=
is appalling=20

catastrophe which had overtaken her and the hideous outrage to which she wa=
s being subjected=20

by her own father. She was sobbing convulsively. But in the face of his abo=
minable callousness,=20

she made a great effort to regain her self-control. Her pride, her dignity =
came to the rescue. She=20

had had time in those few seconds to realise that she was indeed more helpl=
ess than any bird in a=20

fowler's net, and that only absolute calm and presence of mind could possib=
ly save her now.  If=20

indeed there was the slightest hope of salvation.  She drew herself up and =
resolutely dried her=20

eyes and readjusted her hair and her hood and mantle.  "We can talk openly =
at once, sir," she said=20

coldly. "I am ready to hear what explanation you can offer for this monstro=
us outrage."  "I owe you=20

no explanation, my child," he retorted calmly. "Presently when you are rest=
ored to your own sense=20

of dignity and of self-respect you will remember that a lady of the house o=
f Kernogan does not=20

elope in the night with a stranger and a heretic like some kitchen-wench. H=
aving so far forgotten=20

herself my daughter must, alas! take the consequences, which I deplore, of =
her own sins and lack=20

of honour."  "And no doubt, father," she retorted, stung to the quick by hi=
s insults, "that you too will=20

anon be restored to your own sense of self-respect and remember that hither=
to no gentleman of=20

the house of Kernogan has acted the part of a liar and of a hypocrite!"  "S=
ilence!" he commanded=20

sternly.  "Yes!" she reiterated wildly, "it was the role of a liar and of a=
 hypocrite that you played=20

from the moment when you sat down to pen that letter full of protestations =
of affection and=20

forgiveness, until like a veritable Judas you betrayed your own daughter wi=
th a kiss. Shame on=20

you, father!" she cried. "Shame!"  "Enough!" he said, as he seized her wris=
t so roughly that the cry=20

of pain which involuntarily escaped her effectually checked the words in he=
r mouth. "You are mad,=20

beside yourself, a thoughtless, senseless creature whom I shall have to coe=
rce more effectually if=20

you do not cease your ravings. Do not force me to have recourse once again =
to M. Martin-Roget's=20

assistance to keep your undignified outburst in check."  The name of the ma=
n whom she had=20

learned to hate and fear more than any other human being in the world was s=
ufficient to restore to=20

her that measure of self-control which had again threatened to leave her.  =
"Enough indeed," she=20

said more calmly; "the brain that could devise and carry out such infamy in=
 cold blood is not like to=20

be influenced by a defenceless woman's tears. Will you at least tell me whi=
ther you are taking=20

me?"  "We go to a place on the coast now," he replied coldly, "the outlandi=
sh name of which has=20

escaped me. There we embark for Holland, from whence we shall join their Ro=
yal Highnesses at=20

Coblentz. It is at Coblentz that your marriage with M. Martin-Roget will ta=
ke place, and...."  "Stay,=20

father," she broke in, speaking quite as calmly as he did, "ere you go any =
further. Understand me=20

clearly, for I mean every word that I say. In the sight of God--if not in t=
hat of the laws of France--I=20

am the wife of Lord Anthony Dewhurst. By everything that not ridden long wh=
en the huge ungainly=20

bisons were seen like black specks on the horizon.  Still the horsemen--eac=
h armed with the=20

muzzle-loading, single-barrelled, flint-lock gun of the period--advanced ca=
utiously, until so near=20

that the animals began to look up as if in surprise at the unwonted intrusi=
on on their great=20



solitudes.  Then the signal was given, the horses stretched out at the gall=
op, the buffalo began to=20

run--at first heavily, as if great speed were impossible to them; but gradu=
ally the pace increased=20

until it attained to racing speed.  Then the hunters gave the rein to their=
 eager steeds, and the long=20

line rushed upon the game like a tornado of centaurs.  From this point all =
discipline was at an end.=20

Each man fought for his own hand, killing as many animals as he could, so t=
hat ere long the plain=20

was strewn with carcases, and the air filled with gunpowder smoke.  We have=
 said that all the=20

hunters set out, but this is not strictly correct, for three were left behi=
nd.  One of these had fallen=20

sick; one had sprained his wrist, and another was lazy.  It need scarcely b=
e told that the lazy one=20

was Francois La Certe.  "There is no hurry," he said, when the hunters were=
 assembling for the=20

start; "plenty of time.  My horse has not yet recovered from the fatigues o=
f the journey.  And who=20

knows but the report of the buffalo being so near may be false?  I will wai=
t and see the result.  To-

morrow will be time enough to begin.  Then, Slowfoot, you will see what I c=
an do.  Your hands=20

shall be busy.  We will load our cart with meat and pemmican, pay off all o=
ur debts, and spend a=20

happy winter in Red River. What have you got there in the kettle?"  "Pork,"=
 answered Slowfoot=20

with characteristic brevity.  "Will it soon be ready?"  "Soon."  "Have you =
got the tea unpacked?"=20

"Yes."  "Send me your pipe."  This latter speech was more in the tone of a =
request than a=20

command, and the implied messenger from the opposite side of the fire was t=
he baby-- Baby La=20

Certe.  We never knew its name, if it had one, and we have reason to believ=
e that it was a female=20

baby.  At the time, baby was quite able to walk--at least to waddle or todd=
le.  A brief order from the=20

maternal lips sent Baby La Certe toddling round the fire towards its father=
, pipe in hand; but, short=20

though the road was, it had time to pause and consider.  Evidently the idea=
 of justice was strongly=20

developed in that child.  Fair wage for fair work had clearly got hold of i=
t, for it put the pipe which=20

was still alight, in its mouth and began to draw!  At this the father smile=
d benignly, but Slowfoot=20

made a demonstration which induced a rather prompt completion of the walk w=
ithout a reasonable=20

wage.  It sucked vigorously all the time, however, being evidently well awa=
re that Francois was not=20

to be feared.  At that moment the curtain of the tent lifted, and little Bi=
ll Sinclair limped in.  He was=20

a favourite with La Certe, who made room for him, and at once offered him t=
he pipe, but Billie=20

declined.  "No, thank you, La Certe.  I have not learned to smoke yet."  "H=
a! you did not begin=20

young enough," said the half-breed, glancing proudly at his own offspring. =
 We may explain here=20

once for all that, although he had lived long enough in the colony to under=
stand French, Billie=20

spoke to his friend in English, and that, although La Certe understood Engl=
ish, he preferred to=20

speak in French.  "What have you been doing?" he asked, when the boy had se=
ated himself.  "I've=20

been shooting at a mark with my bow and arrow--brother Archie made it for m=
e."  "Let me see--

yes, it is very well made.  Where is brother Archie?"  "Gone after the buff=
alo."  "What!--on a=20

horse?"  "He could not go very well after them on foot--could he?" replied =
the boy quietly.=20


_
most dear I swear to you that I will never become Martin-Roget's wife. I wo=
uld die first," she added=20

with burning but resolutely suppressed passion.  He shrugged his shoulders.=
  "Pshaw, my child,"=20

he said quietly, "many a time since the world began have women registered s=
uch solemn and=20

sacred vows, only to break them when force of circumstance and their own go=
od sense made=20

them ashamed of their own folly."  "How little you know me, father," was al=
l that she said in reply.=20

III  Indeed, Yvonne de Kernogan--Yvonne Dewhurst as she was now in sight of=
 God and men--had=20

far too much innate dignity and self-respect to continue this discussion, s=
eeing that in any case=20

she was physically the weaker, and that she was absolutely helpless and def=
enceless in the hands=20

of two men, one of whom--her own father--who should have been her protector=
, was leagued with=20

her bitterest enemy against her.  That Martin-Roget was her enemy--aye and =
her father's too--she=20

had absolutely no doubt. Some obscure yet keen instinct was working in her =
heart, urging her to=20

mistrust him even more wholly than she had done before. Just now, when he l=
aid ruthless hands=20

on her and carried her, inert and half-swooning, back into the coach, and s=
he lay with closed eyes,=20

her very soul in revolt against this contact with him, against the feel of =
his arms around her, a=20

vague memory surcharged with horror and with dread stirred within her brain=
: and over the vista of=20

the past few years she looked back upon an evening in the autumn--a rough n=
ight with the wind=20

from the Atlantic blowing across the lowlands of Poitou and soughing in the=
 willow trees that=20

bordered the Loire--she seemed to hear the tumultuous cries of enraged that=
 Archie was too=20

young to use a gun on horseback, and that he might shoot some of the people=
 instead of the=20

buffalo, or burst his gun, or fall off.  But _I_ don't think so.  Archie ca=
n do anything.  I know, for I've=20

seen him do it."  "And so he has left you in camp all by yourself.  What a =
shame, Billie!"  "No,=20

Francois, it is not a shame.  Would you have me keep him from the fun just =
because I can't go?=20

_That_ would indeed be a shame, wouldn't it?"  "Well, perhaps you're right,=
 Billie."  "I know I'm=20

right," returned the boy, with a decision of tone that would have been offe=
nsive if it had not been=20

accompanied with a look of straightforward gentleness that disarmed resentm=
ent.  "But, I say,=20

Francois, why are you not out with the rest?"  "Oh, because--because--Well,=
 you know, my horse=20

is tired, and--and, I'm not quite sure that the buffalo really have been se=
en as near as they say.=20

And I can go to-morrow just as well.  You see, Billie, there is no need to =
hurry oneself."  "No, I=20

don't see that.  I think there's always need for hurry, specially with men =
like you.  I know the=20

reason you don't go out better than yourself, Francois."  "Yes--what is it?=
" asked the half-breed=20

with a slight laugh.  "It's laziness.  That's what it is, and you should be=
 ashamed of yourself."  The=20

large mild eyes and low voice, and pale earnest face of the plain-spoken in=
valid were such that it=20

would have been impossible for any one to be offended with him, much less L=
a Certe, whose spirit=20

of indignation it was almost impossible to arouse.  He winced a little at t=
he home-thrust, however,=20

because he knew it to be true.  "You're hard on me, Little Bill," he said w=
ith a benignant look, as he=20

picked a=20


_
the gale, she felt the crowd of evil-intentioned men around the closed carr=
iage wherein she sat,=20

calm and unafraid. Darkness then was all around her. She could not see. She=
 could only hear and=20

feel. And she heard the carriage door being wrenched open, and she felt the=
 cold breath of the=20

wind upon her cheek, and also the hot breath of a man in a passion of fury =
and of hate.  She had=20

seen nothing then, and mercifully semi-unconsciousness had dulled her achin=
g senses, but even=20

now her soul shrunk with horror at the vague remembrance of that ghostlike =
form--the spirit of hate=20

and of revenge--of its rough arms encircling her shoulders, its fingers und=
er her chin--and then=20

that awful, loathsome, contaminating kiss which she thought then would have=
  "No, I'm not hard,"=20

returned the boy gravely.  Indeed he was always grave, and seldom laughed t=
hough he=20

sometimes smiled faintly at the jokes and quips of his volatile brother and=
 Fred Jenkins the=20

seaman: "I'm not half hard enough," he continued; "I like you, Francois, an=
d that's the reason why I=20

scold you and try to get you to mend.  I don't think there's such a lazy ma=
n in the whole Settlement=20

as you.  You would rather sit and smoke and stuff yourself with pork all da=
y than take the trouble=20

to saddle your horse and get your gun and go out with the rest. Why are you=
 so lazy, Francois?"=20

"I'm sure I don't know, Little Bill, unless it be that I'm born to be lazy.=
  Other people are born, I=20

suppose, to be active and energetic. They like activity=20


_
pure, sweet kisses of a brave and loyal man whom she loved and revered, to =
make her forget that=20

hideous, indelible stain: and in the arms of her dear milor she had forgott=
en that one terrible=20

moment, when she had felt that the embrace of death must be more endurable =
than that of this=20

unknown and hated man.  It was the memory of that awful night which had com=
e back to her as in=20

a flash while she lay passive and broken in Martin-Roget's arms. Of course =
for the moment she=20

had no thought of connecting the rich quiet, and--so I do that.  Not much d=
ifference after all!  We=20

both do what we like best!"  Little Bill was perplexed.  Although philosoph=
ical in tendency he had=20

not had sufficient experience in sophistical reasoning to enable him to dis=
entangle the sinuosities=20

of bad logic.  But he was a resolute little fellow, and not easily quelled.=
  "What would happen," he=20

asked, "if everybody in the world did as you do?"  "Well, I suppose everybo=
dy would enjoy=20

themselves.  There would be no more fightings or wars, or any=20
