JULIET. Or hired from Mudie's, read by every clerk--    HELEN. And every sn=
iggering waitress=20

after dark.    JULIET. I could have stood a mere divorce. But this!    HELE=
N. Every one _must_=20

know who Calypso is.    JULIET. Of course. I simply daren't be seen about. =
   HELEN. Who _is_=20

this Galahad Green? I can't find out.    JULIET. A blood-sucker, a literary=
 flea!    HELEN. I'll sue=20

the cad for libel. Just you see!    JULIET. You dear! It ought to be _my_ a=
ction, though.    HELEN.=20

Yours? You can't mind as much as I, you know.    JULIET. Can't I! You think=
 I'd stay in England=20

now?    HELEN. What? Leave your home? No, that I can't allow.    JULIET. Wo=
n't you come, too?=20

To-morrow I shall start.    HELEN. Of course you're sweet to take it so to =
heart--    JULIET. Who=20

wouldn't--with her reputation gone?    HELEN. It must be such a bitter pill=
 for John!    JULIET.=20

What would John care because I'm painted black?    HELEN. You?    JULIET.  =
         In this book,=20

this dastardly attack--     Yet, you dear noble girl, at least it's shown  =
   That to you my misfortunes=20

are your own.    HELEN. Juliet--what _do_ you mean? Sometimes your gibes   =
  Are most ill-timed.=20

You know the book describes     Me.    JULIET. You're not serious?    HELEN=
.            I? Of course=20

I am....     And now that I've discovered what a sham     You were with all=
 your sympathy, I could=20

hurl     The foul book at your head. You heartless girl!     Is this a time=
 to mock me, to pretend=20

You care so much about your slandered friend     That you won't stay in Eng=
land? If that's your=20

Notion of fun, it isn't mine, be sure.    JULIET. I wasn't being funny--not=
 a bit,     Really. It's simply=20

that the cap does fit--     I _am_ Calypso!    HELEN.            Well, I ne=
ver heard     Such nonsense=20

in my life. It's too absurd.     Oh, if I could but think that one or two  =
   Readers might fancy it was=20

meant for you,     I'd take some pleasure in my life again,     Dance, have=
 a feast of oysters and=20

champagne,     Buy a new winter frock and hat, instead     Of wishing, as I=
 do, that I were dead.=20

For you deserve it--you that make a joke     Out of my misery.    JULIET.  =
         Helen--when I=20

spoke     Of being Calypso, didn't I, to my shame,     Own the wild sins th=
at cluster round her=20

name?     Alas, I meant it.    HELEN.            Nobody could be     So bli=
nd as not to know it's me--I--

me:     And since you're now my enemy, I shall go     At once. But after th=
is, I'd have you know,=20

Our friendship's dead--for always! Please forget     You ever knew me.    J=
ULIET.           Helen,=20

don't go yet....    HELEN. I must. And let me say that if you call     To-m=
orrow you'll have wasted=20

time, that's all.     I shan't go home to-night.    JULIET.           Where=
 will you sleep?    HELEN.=20

Battersea Bridge is high, and the Thames deep.    JULIET. You wicked child!=
 You mustn't talk like=20

that.    HELEN. A plunge and then----    JULIET.           With such a pret=
ty hat?    HELEN=20

(_returning_). You never said you liked it.    JULIET.           No. I've b=
een     So worried all day by=20

this Galahad Green.     For really, Helen, once and for all be certain     =
It's not from _your_ life that=20

he's wrenched the curtain.     You can still face the world. You've not the=
 least     Cause to=20

abominate the loathsome beast--     Except as I'm your friend: and since I =
know,     Now, that your=20

strange mistake has hurt you so,     Believe me, I rejoice--yes, even rejoi=
ce--     That I, not you,=20

suffer by Galahad's choice.     I bear it willingly. Must I prove my case? =
    Give me one moment,=20

while I find the place....  (_She opens the book and searches through it fe=
verishly._)    HELEN=20

(_opening copy_). Oh, if it comes to evidence...! But indeed     I simply c=
an't go through it!=20

JULIET.                       Let me read     Page twenty-four: 'Between hi=
m and his wife     A deep gulf=20

 knew,     The monocle=20

of _The Saturday Review_'--     There! Don't you see? That paper's just the=
 one     I always said=20

would patronize the sun.    HELEN. That? Why, look here--page forty-two--'H=
er eyes     Were=20



green, her honey-coloured----'    JULIET.           Mere disguise!     He _=
had_ to change a little here=20

and there.     Listen: 'She glowered----'    HELEN.            'Her honey-c=
oloured hair     Lay in=20

profusion on her shoulders----'    JULIET.           'Then     She thought =
"It's time----"    HELEN.=20

'To win the love of men--     "What's that?" she cried. "I ever hated sin--=
--"    JULIET. "But now I'll=20

change. To-morrow I'll begin....     My sins are many. Can they be washed a=
way?"'    HELEN. 'So=20

she used Morny bath-salts every day.     Often she'd sponge herself for hou=
rs, and dream     Of=20

love, veiled only by the bashful steam.     Sometimes, perhaps, an over-amo=
rous drop     Would=20

trickle down----'    JULIET (_shocked_).  Helen, my dear--do stop!     Real=
ly!    HELEN. But that's=20

conclusive!    JULIET.           I admit     That she had beauty, savoir-fa=
ire, and wit,     But she was=20

wicked, too, reckless and haughty----    HELEN. I can't pretend that I was =
never naughty.=20

JULIET. Naughty, perhaps; but you could never trip so     Continually as Mr=
. Green's Calypso.=20

HELEN. I do believe you think I wouldn't dare     Calypso's deeds. I've don=
e them all--so there!=20

JULIET. Well, you shall have the truth. I'll make a clean     Breast of it.=
 Who, you ask, is Galahad=20

Green?     I know him!    HELEN.            Juliet! And he dares affirm    =
 That I was not.... The lily-

livered worm!    JULIET. But if he writes a letter to the Press     Declari=
ng that he never saw you----=20

HELEN.            Yes,     And makes me look a fool. What can I do     When=
 every one I meet says=20

'Is it you....     That wicked gorgeous creature, that wild thing     Ecsta=
tic and unmoral as the=20

Spring...?'     Of course I owned it.    JULIET.           Helen--I can sti=
ll     Save you. I'll make him=20

write----    HELEN.        No, no!    JULIET.           I will--     And no=
w, at once. The telephone!=20

HELEN (_stopping_ JULIET).    But I say     You're not to!    JULIET (_stru=
ggling_). Let me go! We=20

can't delay.    HELEN. Juliet, for goodness' sake don't be so dense!    JUL=
IET. What _do_ you=20

mean?    HELEN.            Where's your intelligence,     Your tact, your f=
eminine intuition? Where=20

Your sympathy? Must I lay my soul quite bare?    JULIET (_returning and col=
lapsing into her=20

chair_). So far as I'm     concerned you're talking Greek.    HELEN. They'v=
e sold nine thousand=20

copies in one week.    JULIET. Why, one would think, in spite of all that's=
 passed,     You liked the=20

book.    HELEN.            So you've got there at last!     You _are_ an al=
so-ran.    JULIET.=20

Good heavens!    HELEN.                          I had     To _say_ that I =
was furious, and not glad;     But=20

what girl wouldn't feel some little stir     Of pride when all the town's i=

do you see my point? Didn't you lie     When you said that Calypso wasn't I=
?    JULIET. Yes.=20

HELEN.            And the author learnt it all from you.     I think you ow=
e me something.    JULIET.=20

Very true....     What do you want?    HELEN.            Oh, Juliet--since =
I've been     His model, do=20

you think that Mr. Green     Would possibly--just some day--take me out    =
 To supper?    JULIET.=20

                     No doubt.=20

But if he's free----?    JULIET.           Use your intelligence,     Your =
feminine intuition.    HELEN.=20

Yes, but how?    JULIET. Galahad does invite you here and now.     All is n=

VOLCANIC ISLAND   _Characters_      DOROTHEA WYLDE     works of this undoub=
tedly great=20

man were publicly burned by Paracelsus and his disciples; and for centuries=
 following, the medical=20

world was divided between the Galenists and the chemists, until a complete =
ascendency over both=20

was obtained by the sect of the Vitalists. This state of things has been oc=
casioned by the=20

circumstance that medical practitioners have often been more given to the f=
ormation of theories=20

upon the nature of disease and the mode of its treatment, than to that care=
ful observation and=20

patient accumulation of facts, by which, in other sciences, the phenomena o=
f nature have been=20

unravelled. I am far from undervaluing the great benefits conferred upon ma=
nkind by the study of=20

medicine, and have no wish to minister to any vulgar prejudice against a us=
eful and learned=20

profession, but it is not to be overlooked that, as an art, it has been cha=
racterized, in a greater=20

degree, by fluctuations of opinion as to its principles and the mode of its=
 practice, than, perhaps,=20

any other pursuit. That it has been distinguished by the constant promulgat=
ion and explosion of=20

theories, that it has alternated between the advancement of new doctrines a=
nd the revival of old=20

ones, and that its professors in every age have been noted for the tenacity=
 with which they have=20

clung to opinions, and the unanimity with which they have resisted the intr=
oduction of valuable=20

discoveries. They still continue to disagree in respect to the treatment of=
 diseases as old as the=20

human race; and at the present day, when great advances have been made in a=
ll departments of=20

knowledge, a radical and fundamental difference divides the allopathist fro=
m the followers of=20

Hahnemann, to say nothing of those who believe in the sovereign instrumenta=
lity of water.  =E2=80=9CIn=20

fact, nothing comparatively is known of the philosophy of disease. Its erad=
ication or cure, where=20

the result of human agency is, in the great majority of instances, attribut=
able rather to the careful=20

observation, judgment and experience of the particular practitioner, than t=
o the application of=20

general or established methods available to all. The popular axiom, that =
=E2=80=98doctors differ,=E2=80=99 is as true=20

now as it ever was, and as long as it continues to be so, it is impossible =
for the law to recognize=20

any class of practitioners, or the followers of any particular system or me=
thod of treatment, as=20

exclusively entitled to be regarded as doctors. In adverting to the conflic=
ting views and differences=20

of opinion, that exist and have ever existed in the practice of the healing=
 art, it is not to call in=20

question the value of learned, skilful and experienced physicians, but mere=
ly to show the error of=20

attempting, in the present state of medical science, to recognize, as matte=
r of law, any one system=20

of practice, or of declaring that the practitioner who follows a particular=
 system is a doctor, and that=20

one who pursues a different method is not.=E2=80=9D And see also White _v._=

Ordronaux=E2=80=99 =E2=80=9CJurisprudence of Medicine,=E2=80=9D 27.  This d=
ecision was prior to the statute of 1874 and the=20

provisions of the Penal Code before noted. Since those statutes, it is a mi=
sdemeanor to practise=20

except as permitted by the provisions of those statutes.   IN NEW YORK AND =
ELSEWHERE=20

PRACTITIONER WITHOUT LICENSE CANNOT SUE AND RECOVER FOR HIS FEES.  Since=20

the passage of the New York Act of 1844 (Laws of 1844, p. 406), there has b=
een no precise=20



statutory provision in that State prohibiting in terms persons who practise=
 physic or surgery without=20

a license, from suing to obtain a recovery for services performed. But this=
 is of little consequence,=20

for, as we have already stated, so practising has been declared to be a mis=
demeanor by the Penal=20

Code of New York.  It is a well-settled principle that when any act is decl=
ared by statute to be=20

criminal, a contract calling for the performance of such an act is illegal =
and void. The early English=20

authorities on this point are fully collated in Wheeler v. Russell (17 Metc=
., Mass., 258), and the=20

later English and American cases may be found in =E2=80=9CAmerican and Engl=
ish Cyclop=C3=A6dia of Law,=E2=80=9D=20

title =E2=80=9CContracts,=E2=80=9D Vol. III., p. 872 _et seq._; see also _i=
d._, Vol. XVIII., p. 440. Further consideration=20

of the validity of contracts for medical and surgical services will be had =
hereafter. A full synopsis of=20

the statutes of the different States regulating the licensing of physicians=
 and surgeons in force at=20

the time this volume goes to press will be placed in another chapter.  In a=
 suit between a person=20

who has performed medical and surgical services, and one who employed him, =
it is said that the=20

person performing the services is presumed to have been licensed to do so.[=
157] If the State sues=20

for a penalty, a different rule is claimed to prevail.[158]   HOW MAY A DIP=
LOMA OR LICENSE BE=20

PROVED IN A COURT OF LAW?  It is evident from the foregoing considerations =
that in any=20

proceedings to punish for practising without license or legal authority, an=
d in actions to recover=20

payment for professional services in the States and countries, where a lice=
nse or diploma of a=20

regularly chartered school or college is required by statute to entitle the=
 person to practise, it may=20

become important to establish=E2=80=94first, the legal authority to grant t=
he license or diploma; and=20

second, the genuineness of the license or diploma produced. It frequently h=
appens that the=20

diploma or license has been obtained in another State or country. Under the=
 New York statutes,=20

especially the laws of 1880 and 1890, it was made necessary to file a diplo=
ma. When it had been=20

issued by a chartered school of another State it must be certified to by so=
me lawfully incorporated=20

medical college in this State, before being received for filing, or regarde=
d by the law as conferring=20

upon its possessor the right to practise in that State.  As to the chief el=
ement of authenticity,=20

namely, the legal incorporation or authority of the body or institution gra=
nting the diploma, it is=20

clear that the act of incorporation itself would be the best evidence of th=
e incorporation of the=20

college or school, and a special act granting the power to license to a boa=
rd of censors or other=20

official body or board would have to be produced to show the right vested i=
n that board or body to=20

grant a license. In Georgia it has been held (Hunter _v._ Blount, 27 Ga., 7=
6), that to prove a=20

diploma given to a physician in another State, the existence of the college=
, and the fact of its being=20

a chartered institution, must be shown by producing its act of incorporatio=
n.  In Thornton=E2=80=99s case (8=20

Term Rep., 303; same case, 3 Esp., 4), it was held that the mere production=
 in court of a diploma=20

under the seal of one of the universities, is not of itself evidence to sho=
w that the person named in=20

the diploma received the degree which the diploma specified. In another and=
 later case, however,=20

Simpson _v._ Dunmore (9 M. & W., 45; same case, 5 Jurist, 1012), it was hel=
d that it was=20

unnecessary for the person producing a license from the Apothecaries=E2=80=
=99 Company (an incorporated=20

body) to practise as an apothecary, the seal on which license was proved to=
 be genuine, to give=20

any additional evidence of his identity with the person named in the licens=
e. The reason for this=20

doctrine is probably to be found in the well-known rule of evidence, that i=
dentity of both christian=20

name and family name, is sufficient to raise a presumption of fact that the=
 person bearing the=20

name is the identical person so named in any written instrument.  In Walmsl=
ey _v._ Abbott (1 K. &=20



P., 309; same case, 5 D. & R., 62), proof of the signature of one of the ex=
aminers who signed a=20

certificate of examination was held sufficient to warrant the acceptance of=
 the certificate in=20

evidence in the first instance. In another case the proof was that a person=
 previously a stranger to=20

the place went to a town which was the seat of a university, and was told t=
hat a certain building=20

was the college, and that a certain person whom he saw there was the librar=
ian, and that this=20

librarian showed him what purported to be the seal of the university, and a=
lso a book which the=20

librarian stated was the book of acts or records of the university, and the=
 seal so shown him was=20

compared with the seal of a certain diploma, the genuineness of which was i=
n question, and a=20

copy was made from the said book of acts, of an entry stating that the degr=
ee of M. D. had been=20

conferred by the university upon a person bearing the same name as that in =
the diploma, and this=20

proof was held a sufficient authentication of the diploma, and of the act o=
r authority of the=20

university conferring the degree. Collins case, 1 Addison & Ellis, 695; sam=
e case, 3 N. & M.,=20

703.[159]  _The Rule in Criminal Prosecutions._=E2=80=94We have seen above,=
 that in a criminal=20

prosecution the burden is on the defendant to produce and prove his license=
, but to warrant a=20

conviction for practising without a license it must be shown that the accus=
ed actually _practised_.=20

In addition to the rules and regulations prescribed by the general statutes=
, modern sanitary=20

science has developed so broadly throughout most of the civilized states an=
d countries, that the=20

different governments have established state boards of health, and in many =
instances local boards=20

of health, the latter being limited in their authority and operation to spe=
cific municipal divisions, to=20

which boards the government has committed the power to pass certain sanitar=
y rules and=20

regulations, which rules and regulations may have an important bearing upon=
 and relation to the=20

practice of medicine and surgery. The jurisdiction and powers of these boar=
ds are to be found in=20

of the Employment._=E2=80=94Whatever may have been the theories of the Roma=
n civil law, and following=20

it of the early English common law, as to the character of the employment o=
f physicians and other=20

professional men, it is now so well settled that the reciprocal duties and =
obligations arising=20



between physician and patient, or attorney and client, and the like, are to=
 be classed under and=20

governed by the law of contracts, that any extended discussion of these the=
ories is unnecessary=20

here.[162] Mr. Ordronaux, in the second chapter of his interesting work on =
the =E2=80=9CJurisprudence of=20

Medicine,=E2=80=9D has considered them fully, and has quoted amply from the=
 books of the earlier and later=20

text-writers, and from the expressions of the judges, to show what these th=
eories and rules were;=20

and he and all later authorities agree that the ancient notion, that profes=
sional services are always=20

gratuitous unless a special contract to pay for them is made, has long been=
 abandoned. He=20

observes (pp. 13 and 14): =E2=80=9CBut in our day the increase in the numbe=
