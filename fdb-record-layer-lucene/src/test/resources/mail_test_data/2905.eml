ial, and what a judge!!=20

O, justice! do thy duty; and what thou owest to thyself, defend thy own cau=
se against one who=20

seeks to reduce thee to nothing. In truth, every law ordains that causes sh=
ould be first tried, and=20

sentences examined, before they are put into execution; and to this purpose=
 Julius C=C3=A6sar,=20

according to what Sallust relates, said, That when judges shall put men to =
death before they be=20

condemned, the greatest evils may of the wound and the relative positions o=
f the deceased and=20

the assailant at the time the wounds were inflicted. This latter fact is ve=
ry largely, if not altogether,=20

a matter of speculation as far as the medical evidence goes. It is a popula=
r, though false, idea that=20

a murderer=E2=80=99s clothes must be bloody, and the police may be misled i=
n expecting to find them so in=20

every instance. Taylor[1] cites several cases in which either no blood was =
found on the murderer=E2=80=99s=20

clothes, or only small spots wholly out of=20


_
the Lacedemonians, who, after their victory over the Athenians, constituted=
 thirty persons to=20

govern the public state, who put to death numbers without any previous tria=
l, which caused great=20

misfortunes.  =E2=80=98The like will befal us, if such crimes are suffered =
to go unpunished. Sallust tells us,=20

that when Cataline and his associates were intending to burn the city of Ro=
me and murder its=20

senators, Tully was then consul; but although he was fully acquainted with =
the plot, he did not=20

cause one of the conspirators to be put to death until he had fully proved =
their guilt. Now, my lords,=20

as I have fully and clearly proved the heinousness of the crime with which =
I have charged the duke=20

of Burgundy; and as it was done contrary to all law and justice, I trust it=
 will not remain=20

unpunished, according to the words of our Lord by the prophet Isaiah, in hi=
s 47th chap.: =E2=80=98Videbitur=20

opprobrium tuum, ultionem capiam, et non resistet mihi homo.=E2=80=99  =E2=
=80=98My third argument is grounded on=20

our adversary=E2=80=99s having entered into the strongest possible alliance=
 with the duke of Orleans, in the=20

presence of many of their dependants; and a twelvemonth prior to the murder=
 of the above duke=20

this alliance was renewed before several prelates, nobles, clergymen and co=
unsellors of each=20

side, when the two dukes swore on the crucifix, with the holy evangelists i=
n their hands, to the due=20

and faithful observance of it, promising, on the salvation of their souls, =
and by their honour, that=20

henceforward they would be to each other as brothers and companions in arms=
, engaging to=20

reveal mutually any evil designs that might be plotted or meditated against=
 their persons or=20

interests. They then agreed to wear each other=E2=80=99s badge, which was d=
one. And at the last feast at=20

Compi=C3=A8gne, for the greater confirmation of which must have spurted or =
flowed from the wound.=20

Absence of blood on the prisoner=E2=80=99s clothes is often made use of by =
the defence to prove the=20

prisoner=E2=80=99s innocence, whereas, besides the possibilities of having =
had no spots in the first place,=20

the clothes may have been changed or washed before the examination was made=
. This has=20

occurred in more than one murder trial. Taylor[648] mentions the following =
cases in illustration:  It=20

was alleged that the absence of blood-stains on the prisoner=E2=80=99s clot=
hing was a strong proof of his=20

innocence in the trial of Sub-Inspector Montgomery for the murder of Mr. Gl=
asse (Omagh Ass.,=20

July, 1873). In this case the weapon was a bill-hook which had produced con=
tused wounds on the=20

head. There was blood on the floor about the body, but the wounds were not =
likely to have been=20

accompanied by much spurting. Yet it was assumed that the assailant in this=
 case must have been=20

covered with blood. Much stress was laid upon the absence of blood-stains. =
On the first two trials=20

the jury could not agree, owing chiefly to the absence of blood-stains, but=
 on the third trial he was=20

convicted and afterward admitted that he had removed the blood-stains from =
the clothes with cold=20

water. Also in the case of Reg. _v._ Courvoisier (C.C.C., 1840) the accused=
, who was tried for the=20

murder of Lord William Russel, had no blood-stains on his clothes. All the =
vessels of the throat of=20

the deceased had been cut to the vertebr=C3=A6 while he was asleep. It was =
contended most strongly=20

that the accused could not possibly have committed the crime, as he had no =
blood-stains. But=20

after conviction he confessed that he wore no clothes when he committed the=
 murder, and he only=20

had to wash his hands and the carving-knife he used. Again, in the case of =
Reg. _v._ Thompson=20


_
many of their knights and dependants alternately swear, that they would loy=
ally and truly abide by=20

and support the bonds of friendship entered into between them, through love=
 and attachment to=20

their persons,=E2=80=94and would make known to each party any thing that sh=
ould be imagined against=20

their persons or estate.  =E2=80=98Moreover, my lord of Orleans and our adv=
ersary entered into Wint. Ass.,=20

1863) the defence mainly relied on the absence of blood on the prisoner=E2=
=80=99s clothing. The wound in=20

the throat of the wife of the accused was five inches long, directed from l=
eft to right, dividing all the=20

vessels and nerves of the neck. The medical witness stated justly that no s=
uch wound could be=20

self-inflicted. It was rapidly fatal. No weapon was found near the=20


_
private engagements, promising and swearing on the true cross, that they wo=
uld mutually defend=20

and guard each other=E2=80=99s person and honour against all who should att=
ack them. This agreement=20

was signed with their own hands and seals.  =E2=80=98What now, O duke of Bu=
rgundy!  The same author=20

cites the case of a prisoner on whose trousers worn soon after the murder n=
o blood-marks were=20

found, but the trousers actually worn by him were found with blood upon the=
m. Juries have even=20

acquitted the prisoner apparently only because no marks=20
