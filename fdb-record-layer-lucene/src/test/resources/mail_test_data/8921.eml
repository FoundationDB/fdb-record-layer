philodendron monstera only mildly interested, but then a breeze moved acros=

  Telzey felt a crawling along her startling; but her noble brow, full of t=

ly interested, but then a breeze moved across the lake, crinkling the surfa=
ce of the water, and as it touched the opposite shore, abrupt panic explode=
d among the grazers. They wheeled, went flashing away in effortless twenty-=
foot strides, and were gone among the trees.  Telzey felt a crawling along =
her startling; but her noble brow, full of thought and purpose, the firmnes=
s of her chiselled lip, and the rich fire of her glance vindicated her post=
 as the leading spirit.  They breakfasted in a room which opened on a galle=
ry, and at the other end of the gallery was an apartment similar to the bre=
akfast-room, _
of the ground level of Port Nichay.  Tick-Tock wasn't in sight. A sound of =
voices came from=20

ground-floor windows on the left. Halet had brought her maid and chauffeur =
along; and a chef had=20

showed up in time to make breakfast this morning, as part of the city's gue=
st house service. Telzey=20

took the empty valise to the window, set it on end against the left side of=
 the frame, and let the=20

window slide down until its lower edge rested on the valise. She went back =
to the house guard-

screen panel beside the door, put her finger against the lock button, and p=
ushed.  The sound of=20

voices from the lower floor was cut off as outer doors and windows slid sil=
ently shut all about the=20

house. Telzey glanced back at the window. The valise had creaked a little a=
s the guard field drove=20

the frame down on it, but it was supporting the thrust. She returned to the=
 window, wriggled feet=20

foremost through the opening, twisted around and got a footing on the ledge=
.  A minute later, she=20

was scrambling quietly down a vine-covered patio trellis to the ground. Eve=
n after they discovered=20

she was gone, the guard screen would keep everybody in the house for some l=
ittle while. They'd=20

either have to disengage the screen's main mechanisms and start poking arou=
nd in them, or force=20

open the door to her bedroom and get the lock unset. Either approach would =
involve confusion,=20

upset tempers, and generally delay any organized pursuit.  Telzey edged aro=
und the patio and=20

started towards the wall, keeping close to the side of the house so she cou=
ldn't be seen from the=20

windows. The shrubbery made minor rustling noises as she threaded her way t=
hrough it ... and=20

then there was a different stirring which might have been no more than a sl=
ow, steady current of=20

air moving among the bushes behind her. She shivered involuntarily but didn=
't look back.  She=20

came to the wall, stood still, measuring its height, jumped and got an arm =
across it, swung up a=20

knee and squirmed up and over. She came down on her feet with a small thump=
 in the grass on=20

the other side, glanced back once at the guest house, crossed a path and we=
nt on among the park=20

trees.         *       *       *       *       *  Within a few hundred yard=
s, it became apparent that she had=20

an escort. She didn't look around for them, but spread out to right and lef=
t like a skirmish line,=20

keeping abreast with her, occasional shadows slid silently through patches =
of open, sunlit ground,=20

disappeared again under the trees. Otherwise, there was hardly anyone in si=
ght. Port Nichay's=20

human residents appeared to make almost no personal use of the vast parklan=
d spread out=20

beneath their tower apartments; and its traffic moved over the airways, con=
trol, and which seemed=20

to have been evoked without the exercise of his own will, or that of any ot=
her person.  =E2=80=9CI do not=20

think I can blame myself,=E2=80=9D he said; =E2=80=9Cand I am sure I cannot=
 blame her. And yet=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D  He opened his=20

window and looked upon the moonlit garden, which filled the fanciful quadra=
ngle. The light of the=20

fountain seemed to fascinate his eye, and the music of its fall soothed him=
 into reverie. The=20

distressful images that had gathered round his heart gradually vanished, an=
d all that remained to=20

him was the reality of his happiness. Her beauty and her grace, the sweet s=
tillness of her=20

searching intellect, and the refined pathos of her disposition, only occurr=
ed to him, and he dwelt on=20

them with spell-bound joy.  The great clock of the Towers sounded two.  =E2=
=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9CI must=20

try to sleep. I have got to see the bishop to-morrow morning. I wonder what=
 he wants?=E2=80=9D=20

CHAPTER 44 The bishop was particularly playful on the morrow at breakfast. =
Though his face=20

beamed with Christian kindness, there was a twinkle in his eye which seemed=
 not entirely superior=20

to mundane self-complacency, even to a sense of earthly merriment. His sera=
phic raillery elicited=20

sympathetic applause from the ladies, especially from the daughters of the =
house of Brentham,=20

who laughed occasionally, even before his angelic jokes were well launched.=
 His lambent flashes=20



sometimes even played over the cardinal, whose cerulean armor, nevertheless=
, remained always=20

unscathed. Monsignore Chidioch, however, who would once unnecessarily rush =
to the aid of his=20

chief, was tumbled over by the bishop with relentless gayety, to the infini=
te delight of Lady=20

Corisande, who only wished it had been that dreadful Monsignore Catesby. Bu=
t, though less=20

demonstrative, apparently not the least devout, of his lordship=E2=80=99s v=
otaries, were the Lady Flora and=20

the Lady Grizell. These young gentlewomen, though apparently gifted with ap=
petites becoming=20

their ample, but far from graceless, forms, contrived to satisfy all the wa=
nts of nature without taking=20

their charmed vision for a moment off the prelate, or losing a word which e=
scaped his consecrated=20

lips. Sometimes even they ventured to smile, and then they looked at their =
father and sighed. It=20

was evident, notwithstanding their appetites and their splendid complexions=
, which would have=20

become the Aurora of Guido, that these young ladies had some secret sorrow =
which required a=20

confidante. Their visit to Muriel Towers was their introduction to society,=
 for the eldest had only just=20

attained sweet seventeen. Young ladies under these circumstances always fal=
l in love, but with=20

their own sex. Lady Flora and Lady Grizell both fell in love=20


_
rainbow-hued ribbons which bisected the sky between the upper tower levels.=
 An occasional=20

private aircar went by overhead.  Wisps of thought which were not her own t=
houghts flicked=20

through Telzey's mind from moment to moment as the silent line of shadows m=
oved deeper into=20

the park with her. She realized she was being sized up, judged, evaluated a=
gain. No more=20

information was coming through; they had given her as much information as s=
he needed. In the=20

become their friend and counsellor, and the object of their devoted adorati=
on. It seems that their=20

secret sorrow had its origin in that mysterious religious sentiment which a=
gitates or affects every=20

class and condition of man, and which creates or destroys states, though ph=
ilosophers are daily=20

assuring us =E2=80=9Cthat there is nothing in it.=E2=80=9D The daughters of=
 the Earl of Culloden could not stand any=20

longer the Free Kirk, of which their austere parent was a=20


_
perhaps, they were simply curious now. This was the first human mind they'd=
 been able to make=20

heads or tails of, and that hadn't seemed deaf and silent to their form of =
communication. They=20

were taking time out to study it. They'd been assured she would have someth=
ing of genuine=20

importance to tell them; and there was some derision about that. But they w=
ere willing to wait a=20

little, and find out. They were curious and they liked games. At the moment=
, Telzey and what she=20

might try to do to change their plans was the game on which their attention=
 was fixed.  Twelve=20

minutes passed before the talker on Telzey's wrist began to buzz. It contin=
ued to signal off and on=20

for another few minutes, then stopped. Back in the guest house they couldn'=
t be sure yet whether=20

she wasn't simply locked inside her room and refusing to answer them. But T=
elzey quickened her=20

pace. they had been secretly converted to the Episcopal Church of Scotland =
by a governess, who=20

pretended to be a daughter of the Covenant, but who was really a niece of t=
he primus, and, as=20

Lord Culloden accurately observed, when he ignominiously dismissed her, =E2=
=80=9Ca Jesuit in disguise.=E2=80=9D=20

From that moment there had been no peace in his house. His handsome and gig=
antic daughters,=20

who had hitherto been all meekness, and who had obeyed him as they would a =
tyrant father of the=20

feudal ages, were resolute, and would not compromise their souls. They humb=
ly expressed their=20

desire to enter a convent, or to become at least sisters of mercy. Lord Cul=
loden raged and raved,=20

and delivered himself of cynical taunts, but to no purpose. The principle t=
hat forms Free Kirks is a=20

strong principle, and takes many forms, which the social Polyphemes, who ha=
ve only one eye,=20

cannot=20


_
The park's trees gradually became more massive, reached higher above her, s=
tood spaced more=20

widely apart. She passed through the morning shadow of the residential towe=
r nearest the guest=20

house, and emerged from it presently on the shore of a small lake. On the o=
ther side of the lake, a=20

number of dappled grazing animals like long-necked, tall horses lifted thei=
r heads to watch her.=20

For some might be a diversion when things were at the worst, and this was t=
he reason that he=20

had, contrary to his original intention, accepted the invitation of his war=
d.  Lady Corisande was=20

exactly the guide the girls required. They sat on each side of her, each ho=
lding her hand, which=20

they frequently pressed to their lips. As her form was slight, though of pe=
rfect grace and symmetry,=20

the contrast=20
