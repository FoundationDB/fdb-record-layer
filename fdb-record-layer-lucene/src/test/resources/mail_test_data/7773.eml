everywhere. "As they are doing now," she thought, "this very minute in this=
 car!" Out of all the=20

pictures rose one of a church wedding. And then this picture faded, and cha=
nged to that of her=20

father's funeral in the old frame yellow church. She frowned, her brown eye=
s saddened and=20

suddenly grew wet with a deep homesick tenderness. But in a few moments she=
 smiled again;=20

once more her pulse-beat quickened. For Amy was talking good-humouredly. An=
d Ethel's eyes,=20

now curious, now plainly thrilled, now quizzical, amused and pleased, kept =
watching her, and she=20

asked herself:  "Shall I ever be like that?"  The picture she had of her si=
ster grew each moment=20

more warm and desirable. Eagerly she explored it by the quick questions she=
 threw out.  They=20

were coming into the city now, in a dusk rich with twinkling lights. In the=
 car the passengers were=20

stirring. Amy stood up to be brushed--sleek and alluring, worldly wise--and=
 the fat man in the chair=20

behind her opened wide his heavy eyes. Then Ethel stood up--and in the pois=
e of her figure, slim=20

and lithe with its lovely lines, in her carriage, in her slender neck, in h=
er dark face with its features=20

clear, her lips a little parted, and in the look in her brown eyes--there w=
as something which made=20

glances turn from all down the softly lighted car. There was even a brief s=
ilence. And Ethel drew a=20

sudden breath, as from close behind her the soft voice of the darky porter =
drawled:  "Yes'm--

yes'm--dis is New York. We's comin' right into de station now."    CHAPTER =
II  "Well, Ethel my=20

love, we're here at last! . . . It must be after midnight. I wonder when I'=
ll get to sleep? . . . Not that I=20

care especially. What a quaint habit sleeping is."  She had formed the habi=
t long ago of holding=20

these inner conversations. Her father witnesses may be examined at the hear=
ing by either side,=20

and either side may examine medical experts as to whether such conduct is u=
nprofessional; if it=20

appears to the satisfaction of the board that the applicant is guilty of th=
e unprofessional conduct=20

set out in the citation, no certificate can be granted. No application is r=
efused for unprofessional=20

conduct more than one year before the application. If the holder of a certi=
ficate is guilty of=20

unprofessional conduct, the certificate must be revoked by board granting i=
t; no revocation is valid=20

Ethel had talked and talked to herself in quite as animated a way as though=
 she were saying it all=20

aloud. Now she sat up suddenly in bed and turned on the light just over her=
 head, and amiably she=20

surveyed her room. It was a pretty, fresh, little room with flowered curtai=
ns, a blue rug, a luxurious=20

chaise longue and a small French dressing table. Very cheerful, very empty.=
 "It looks," she=20

decided, "just like the bed feels. I'm the first fellow who has been here. =
