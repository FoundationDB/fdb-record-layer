_
we had passed several small villages, and many brooks that flowed from the =
mountains, we=20

arrived at our old friend, the Atbara river, at the sharp angle as it issue=
s from the mountains. At=20

this place it was in its infancy. The noble Atbara whose course we had trac=
ked for hundreds of=20

weary miles, and whose tributaries we had so carefully examined, was a seco=
nd-class  At the=20

thought of little Matyko as one of God's soldiers her tears began to flow. =
It was lucky if none of=20

them fell into the frying-pan.  "Mrs. Adamecz!" exclaimed Gyuri, alarmed, h=
is voice trembling. "You=20

surely did not burn the handle?"  The old woman looked at him surprised.  "=
How was I to get the=20

three sparks from it if I did not burn it?"  Gyuri fell back=20


_
about equal to the Royan, and not to be named in comparison with the Salaam=
 or Angrab. The=20

power of the Atbara depended entirely upon the western drainage of the Abys=
sinian Alps: of itself=20

it was insignificant, until aided by the great arteries of the mountain cha=
in. The junction of the=20

Salaam at once changed its character; and the Settite or Taccazzy completed=
 its importance as=20

the great river of Abyssinia, that has washed down the fertile soil of thos=
e regions to create the=20

Delta of Lower Egypt; and to perpetuate that Delta by annual deposits, that=
 ARE NOW FORMING=20

A NEW EGYPT BENEATH THE WATERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN. We had seen the Atbara=
=20

a bed of glaring sand--a mere continuation of the burning desert that surro=
unded its course,=20

fringed by a belt of withered trees, like a monument sacred to the memory o=
f a dead river. We had=20

seen the sudden rush of waters when, in the still night, the mysterious str=
eam had invaded the dry=20

bed, and swept all before it like an awakened giant; we knew at that moment=
 "the rains were=20

falling in Abyssinia," although the sky above us was without a cloud. We ha=
d subsequently=20

witnessed that tremendous rainfall, and seen the Atbara at its grandest flo=
od. We had traced each=20

river, and before his eyes, the plates and basins seemed to be dancing a wa=
ltz together; a tongue=20

of fire arose from the fireplace, bringing with it the third demon, who exc=
laimed: "There is nothing=20

here!"  But all at once he felt a hand laid on his arm. It was Sztolarik.  =
"It was, and is no more," he=20

said. "But never mind, Fate intended it to be so. For the future you will n=
ot, at all events, run after a=20

shadow, you will be yourself again, and that is worth a good deal, after al=
l."     CHAPTER III.=20

LITTLE VERONICA IS TAKEN AWAY.   But it was of no use Sztolarik preaching a=
bout the=20

uselessness of worldly goods, for those worldly goods are very pleasant to =
have.  When a favorite=20

child dies, the members of the family always pronounce very wise words, whi=
ch are supposed to=20

comfort one another, such as: "Who knows how the child would have turned ou=
t? It might have=20

come to the gallows in time; perhaps it was better it had died now," etc. B=
ut for all that, wisdom=20

has never yet dried our tears.  Sztolarik said all he could think of to con=
sole Gyuri, but the young=20

lawyer was quite cast down at the thought that his dreams would never now b=
e realized; his whole=20

life was before him, dark and threatening. But the world was the same as=20


_
mighty Atbara from the mountain chain, and we now, after our long journey, =
forded the Atlara in its=20

infancy, hardly knee deep, over its rocky bed of about sixty yards width, a=
nd camped in the little=20

village of Toganai, on the rising ground upon the opposite side. It was eve=
ning, and we sat upon=20

an angarep among the lovely hills that surrounded us, and looked down upon =
the Atbara for the=20

last time, as the sun sank behind the rugged mountain of Ras el Feel (the e=
lephant's head). Once=20

more I thought of that wonderful river Nile, that could flow for ever throu=
gh the exhausting deserts=20

of sand, while the Atbara, during the summer months, shrank to a dry skelet=
on, although the=20

powerful affluents, the Salaam and the Settite, never ceased to flow, every=
 drop of their waters=20

was evaporated by the air and absorbed by the desert sand in the bed of the=
 Atbara, two hundred=20

miles above its junction with the Nile!  The Atbara exploration was complet=
ed; and I looked forward=20

to the fresh enterprise of new rivers and lower latitudes, that should unra=
vel the as though Widow=20

Adamecz had never burned the handle of the umbrella.  The hands of the pari=
sh clock pointed to=20

the Roman figure II., and the chimes rang out on the air; the servants laid=
 the table for dinner, Mrs.=20

Adamecz brought in the soup, and his reverence led his guests into the dini=
ng-room, and placed=20

them right and left of Madame Krisbay, when all at once they noticed that V=
eronica was missing.=20

"I was just going to ask," said Madame Krisbay, "if she had been with the g=
entlemen?"  "I thought=20

she was with you," said the priest.  "I have not seen her for two hours."  =
"Nor I."  "Nor we."=20

"Perhaps she is in the kitchen?"  Madame Krisbay looked vexed, got up from =
her seat, and went=20

into the kitchen to call her pupil, but returned at once with the remark th=
at she had not been seen=20

there either.  "Where can she be?" exclaimed the priest, and ran out to loo=
k for her, sending the=20

servants to some of her favorite seats in the garden, thinking she might ha=
ve gone there to read,=20

and have forgotten the time.  Mrs. Adamecz grumbled in the kitchen,=20
