car, the others following. Delquos climbed into the car first, opened the b=
ig trunk compartment in=20

the rear. TT was slid inside and the trunk compartment locked.  "Where are =
you taking her?"=20

Telzey asked sullenly as Delquos lifted the car into the air.  "To the spac=
eport, dear," Halet said.=20

"Dr. Droon and I both felt it would be better to spare your feelings by not=
 prolonging the matter=20

unnecessarily."  Telzey wrinkled her nose disdainfully, and walked up the a=
ircar to stand behind=20

Delquos' seat. She leaned against the back of the seat for an instant. Her =
legs felt shaky.  The=20

chauffeur gave her a sober wink from the side.  "That's a dirty trick she's=
 was signified by Babylon.=20

The bishop shrugged his shoulders when he received Mr. Smylie=E2=80=99s pap=
ers, the examining chaplain=20

sighed, and the archdeacon groaned. But man is proverbially short-sighted. =
The doctrine of=20

evolution affords no instances so striking as those of sacerdotal developme=
nt. Placed under the=20

favoring conditions of clime and soil, the real character of the Reverend D=
ionysius Smylie=20

gradually, but powerfully, developed itself. Where he now ministered, he wa=
s attended by=20

acolytes, and incensed by thurifers. The shoulders of a fellow countryman w=
ere alone equal to the=20

burden of the enormous cross which preceded him; while his ecclesiastical w=
ardrobe furnished=20

him with many colored garments, suited to every season of the year, and eve=
ry=20


_
"I tried to warn you."  "I know." Telzey took a deep breath. "Look, Delquos=
, in just a minute=20

something's going to happen! It'll look dangerous, but it won't be. Don't l=
et it get you nervous ...=20

right?"  "Huh?" Delquos appeared startled, but kept his voice low. "Just _w=
hat's_ going to=20

happen?"  "No time to tell you. Remember what I said."         *       *   =
    *       *       *  Telzey moved=20

back a few steps from the driver's seat, turned around, said unsteadily, "H=
alet ... Dr. Droon--"=20

Halet had been speaking quietly to Dr. Droon; they both looked up.  "If you=
 don't move, and don't=20

do anything stupid," Telzey said rapidly, "you won't get hurt. If you do ..=
. well, I don't know! You=20

see, there's another crest cat in the car...." In her mind she added, "Now!=
"  It was impossible to tell=20

in just what section of the car Iron Thoughts had been lurking. The carpeti=
ng near the rear=20

passenger seats seemed to blur for an instant. Then he was there, camouflag=
e dropped, sitting on=20

the floorboards five feet from the naturalist and Halet.  Halet's mouth ope=
ned wide; she tried to=20

scream but fainted instead. Dr. Droon's right hand started out quickly towa=
rds the big stungun=20

device beside his seat. Then he checked himself and sat still, ashen-faced.=
  Telzey didn't blame=20

him for changing his mind. She felt he must be a remarkably brave man to ha=
ve moved at all. Iron=20

Thoughts, twice as broad across the back as Tick-Tock, twice of the Church.=
  At first there was=20

indignation, and rumors or prophecies that we should soon have another case=
 of perversion, and=20

that Mr. Smylie was going over to Rome; but these superficial commentators =
misapprehended the=20

vigorous vanity of the man. =E2=80=9CRome may come to me,=E2=80=9D said Mr.=
 Smylie, =E2=80=9Cand it is perhaps the best=20

thing it could do. This is the real Church without Romish error.=E2=80=9D  =
The bishop and his reverend stuff,=20

who were at first so much annoyed at the preferment of Mr. Smylie, had now,=
 with respect to him,=20

only one duty, and that was to restrain his exuberant priestliness; but the=
y fulfilled that duty in a=20

kindly and charitable spirit; and, when the Reverend Dionysius Smylie was a=
ppointed chaplain to=20

Lothair, the bishop did not shrug his shoulders, the chaplain did not sigh,=
 nor the archdeacon=20

groan.  The party was so considerable to-day that they dined in the great h=
all. When it was=20

announced to Lothair that his lordship=E2=80=99s dinner was served, and he =
offered his arm to his destined=20

companion, he looked around, and, then in an audible voice, and with a stat=
eliness becoming such=20

an incident, called upon the high-sheriff to lead the duchess to the table.=
 Although that eminent=20

personage had been thinking of nothing else for days, and during the last h=
alf-hour had felt as a=20

man feels, and can only feel, who knows that some public function is moment=
arily about to fall to=20

his perilous discharge, he was taken=20


_
like a devil-beast even to her. His dark-green marbled hide was criss-cross=
ed with old scar=20

patterns; half his tossing crimson crest appeared to have been ripped away.=
 He reached out now=20

in a fluid, silent motion, hooked a paw under the stungun and flicked upwar=
ds. The big instrument=20

rose in an incredibly swift, steep arc eighty feet into the air, various pa=
rts flying away from it,=20

before it started curving down towards the treetops below the car. Iron Tho=
ughts lazily swung his=20

head around and looked at Telzey with yellow fire-eyes.  "Miss Telzey! Miss=
 Telzey!" Delquos was=20

muttering behind her. "You're _sure_ it won't...."  Telzey swallowed. At th=
e moment, she felt barely=20

mouse-sized again. "Just relax!" she told Delquos in a shaky voice. "He's r=
eally quite t-t-t-tame."=20

Iron Thoughts produced a harsh but not unamiable chuckle in her mind.      =
   *       *       *       *=20

*  The pearl-gray sportscar, covered now by its streamlining canopy, drifte=
d down presently to a=20

parking platform outside and lost his head. But the band of Lothair, who we=
re waiting at the door of=20

the apartment to precede the procession to the hall, striking up at this mo=
ment =E2=80=9CThe Roast Beef of=20

Old England,=E2=80=9D reanimated his heart; and, following Lothair, and pre=
ceding all the other guests=20

down the gallery, and through many chambers, he experienced the proudest mo=
ment of a life of=20

struggle, ingenuity, vicissitude, and success.       CHAPTER 45 Under all t=
his flowing festivity there=20

was already a current of struggle and party passion. Serious thoughts and s=
ome anxiety occupied=20

the minds of several of the guests, amid the variety of proffered dishes an=
d sparkling wines, and=20

the subdued strains of delicate music. This disquietude did not touch Lotha=
ir. He was happy to find=20

himself in his ancestral hall, surrounded by many whom he respected, and by=
 some whom he=20

loved. He was an excellent host, which no one can be who does not combine a=
 good heart with=20

high breeding.  Theodora was rather far from him, but he could catch her=20


_
offices on Jontarou's Planetary Moderator, on the fourteenth floor of the S=
hikaris' Club Tower. An=20

attendant waved it on into a vacant slot.  Inside the car, Delquos set the =
brakes, switched off the=20

engine, asked, "Now what?"  "I think," Telzey said reflectively, "we'd bett=
er lock you in the trunk=20

compartment with my aunt and Dr. Droon while I talk to the Moderator."  The=
 countenance at an=20

angle of the table, as she bowed her head to Mr. Ardenne, the county member=
, who was evidently=20

initiating her in all the mysteries of deer-parks. The cardinal sat near hi=
m, winning over, though=20

without apparent effort, the somewhat prejudiced Lady Agramont. His eminenc=
e could converse=20

with more facility than others, for he dined off biscuits and drank=20
