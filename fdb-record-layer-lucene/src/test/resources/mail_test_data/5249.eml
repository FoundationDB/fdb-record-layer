Chaldaean divine dynasties.      SECTION XXVI. THE IDOLS AND THE TERAPHIM. =
  The=20

meaning of the "fairy-tale" told by the Chaldaean Qu-tamy is easily underst=
ood. His _modus=20

operandi_ with the "idol of the moon" was that of all the Semites, before T=
erah, Abraham's father,=20

made images--the Teraphim, called after him--or the "chosen people" of Isra=
el ceased divining by=20

them. These teraphim were just as much "idols" as is any pagan image or sta=
tue.(436) The=20

injunction "Thou shalt not bow to a graven image," or teraphim, must have e=
ither come at a later=20

date, or have been disregarded, since the bowing-down to and the divining b=
y the teraphim seem=20

to have been so orthodox and general that the "Lord" actually threatens the=
 Israelites, through=20

Hosea, to deprive them of their teraphim.       For the children of Israel =
shall abide many days=20

without a king,     ... without a sacrifice, and without an image.   Matzeb=
ah, or statue, or pillar, is=20

explained in the _Bible_ to mean "without an ephod and without teraphim."(4=
37)  Father Kircher=20

supports very strongly the idea that the statue of the Egyptian Serapis was=
 identical in every way=20

with those of the seraphim, or teraphim, in the temple of Solomon. Says Lou=
is de Dieu:       They=20

were, village turn swiftly to the left."  And Planchet, with Aramis behind =
him, set off at full gallop,=20

followed by D'Artagnan, who began to think he was in the merry maze of some=
 fantastic dream.=20

9. The Abbe D'Herblay.   At the extremity of the village Planchet turned to=
 the left in obedience to=20

the orders of Aramis, and stopped underneath the window which had light in =
it. Aramis alighted=20

and clapped his hands three times. Immediately the window was opened and a =
ladder of rope was=20

let down from it.  "My friend," said Aramis, "if you like to ascend I shall=
 be delighted to receive=20

you."  "Ah," said D'Artagnan, "is that the way you return to your apartment=
?"  "After nine at night,=20

pardieu!" said Aramis, "the rule of the convent is very severe."  "Pardon m=
e, my dear friend," said=20

D'Artagnan, "I think you said 'pardieu!'"  "Do you think so?" said Aramis, =
smiling; "it is possible.=20

You have no idea, my dear fellow, how one acquires bad habits in these curs=
ed convents, or what=20

evil ways all these men of the church have, with whom I am obliged to live.=
 But will you not go=20

up?"  "Pass on before me, I beg of you."  "As the late cardinal used to say=
 to the late king, 'only to=20

show you the way, sire.'" And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reache=
d the window in an=20

instant.  D'Artagnan followed, but less nimbly, showing=20


_
angels, the presence of one of these spirits being thus attracted     into =
a teraphim and answering=20

the inquirers [consultans]; and even     in this hypothesis the word "terap=
him" would become the=20

equivalent     of "seraphim" by changing the "t" into "s" in the manner of =
    Syrians.(438)   What=20

f I had known that I=20

was to have the honor of your visit I should have procured the gardener's l=
adder; but for me alone=20

this is good enough."  "Sir," said Planchet when he saw D'Artagnan on the s=
ummit of the ladder,=20

"this way is easy for Monsieur Aramis and even for you; in case of necessit=
y I might also climb up,=20

but my two horses cannot mount the ladder."  "Take them to yonder shed, my =
friend," said Aramis,=20

pointing to a low building on the plain; "there you will find hay and straw=
 for them; then come back=20

here and clap your hands three times, and we will give you wine and food. M=
arry, forsooth, people=20

don't die of hunger here."  And Aramis, drawing in the ladder, closed the w=
indow. D'Artagnan then=20

looked around attentively.  Never was there an apartment at the same time m=
ore warlike and more=20

elegant. At each corner were arranged trophies, presenting to view swords o=
