nly one remark of his had=20

annoyed her. Like the woman in the employment bureau, he had warned Ethel a=
gainst men.=20

"When it comes to looks," he had ended, "you're one in a thousand. And in t=
his town--"  "Oh, Joe,=20

for goodness sake hush up!" she had cried. A bright spot of colour had come=
 in each cheek and=20

her strong little mouth had set viciously. "You'll be telling me next that =
I got my position simply on=20

my pretty face! No brains behind it, of course, no mind!" And she had tappe=
d one foot on the floor=20

in a way which made him look at her in a curious manner, startled and admir=
ing.  "Oh, no, I won't,"=20

he had told her meekly. "You've got the makings of more real mind than any =
girl I've ever seen."=20

"Thank you," she had snapped at him, but she had liked him nevertheless. So=
 long as one had to=20

live with a man, even as his sister-in-law, it was well to have him in his =
place.  So her annoyance=20

had died down, and had only risen a little again when one day Joe came to h=
er office. There was=20

some excuse, of course, but his real reason obviously was to have a look at=
 her employer and at=20

the same time show the man that she had a male protector. Booh! . . . But J=
oe had smiled at=20

Greesheimer and had withdrawn quite reassured, leaving her and her job in p=
eace.  As Ethel's=20

business life went on, her self-confidence grew apace. And now that she had=
 proved to herself=20

that she had brains behind her face, she dropped her air of severity and ev=
en began to enjoy the=20

glances which she knew were cast her way, on the streets and in the office.=
 Even on old=20

Greesheimer, when he was in one of his genial moods, she would bestow a win=
ning smile. It was=20

good to have both brains and face. She looked at the city with challenging =
eyes, a self-supporting=20

woman.  And this state of mind might have lasted some time, had it not happ=
ened that one sunny=20

day toward the end of April Greesheimer opened a letter with eager tremblin=
g fingers, read it=20

swiftly and glared with joy, his big glistening eyes nearly leaving their s=
ockets. Then he whirled=20

around in his chair, and as his eye lit on Ethel, he laughed, and in a hars=
h queer voice he cried,=20

"Vell? Now you see? I'm rich alreatty, I'm vell off! I got the Zimmerman co=
ntract--see! I can do vot I=20

like! I got it! I got materia medica and therapeutics; if the examination i=
s satisfactory, the board=20

shall issue a license entitling the applicant to practise medicine. A licen=
se shall not be issued=20

unless the applicant passes an examination satisfactory to all members of t=
he board; the=20

examination papers kept on file by the secretary of the board are _prima fa=
cie_ evidence of all=20

matters therein contained; on refusal of the board to issue a license for f=
ailure on examination, the=20

applicant may appeal to the governor, who may appoint a medical commission =
of review of three=20

members, one from each school of medicine, who shall examine the examinatio=
n papers of the=20

applicant and from them determine whether a license should be issued, and t=
heir decision shall be=20

final; if the said committee by unanimous vote reverse the determination of=
 the board, the board=20

shall issue a license; the expenses of the appeal are borne by the applican=
t (_ib._, s. 4).  The=20

board may, by unanimous vote, refuse or revoke a license for chronic and pe=
rmanent inebriety,=20

the practice of criminal abortion, conviction of a crime involving moral tu=

advertising special ability to treat or cure disease which, in the opinion =
of the said board, it is=20

impossible to cure.  In complaints for violating this section, the accused =
shall be furnished with a=20

copy of the complaint and given a hearing before the said board in person o=
r by attorney (_ib._, s.=20

5).  A person receiving a license must file it, or a certified copy thereof=
, with the clerk of the county=20

in which he resides; and in case of removal into another county he must pro=
cure from the said=20

clerk a certified copy of the said license, and file it with the clerk in t=
he county to which he shall=20



remove (_ib._, s. 6).  EXCEPTIONS.=E2=80=94The act does not apply to commis=
