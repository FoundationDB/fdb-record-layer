 to his two revolvers, and set out on his mission.  The road-agents had, in=

it shall be."  The "General"=20

hurried off with as much alacrity as was possible, with him, toward the qua=
rtz mine, while Redburn=20

likewise made haste to visit the shaft and collect together his handful of =
men.  He passed the=20

cabin on the way, and, seeing Anita seated in the doorway, he came to a mom=
entary halt.  "You=20

had better go inside and lock the doors and windows behind you," he said, a=
dvisingly. "There are=20

invaders in the gulch, and we must try and effect a settlement with them; s=
o it is not desirable that=20

they should see you."  "You are not going to fight them?"  "Yes, if they wi=
ll not come to reasonable=20

terms which I shall name. Why?"  "Oh! don't fight. You will get killed."  "=
Humph! what of that? Who=20

would care if I were killed?"  "I would, for one, Mr. Redburn."  The miner'=
s heart gave a great=20

bound, and he gazed into the pure white face of the girl, passionately. Was=
 it possible that she had=20

in her heart anything akin to love, for _him_? Already be had conceived a p=
assing fancy for her,=20

which might ripen into love, in time.  "Thanks!" he said, catching up her h=
and and pressing it to his=20

lips. "Those words, few as they are, make me happy, Miss Anita. But, stop! =
I must away. Go=20

inside, and keep shady until you see me again;" and so saying he hurried on=
.  In ten minutes' time=20

two score of brawny, half-dressed Utes were rallied in the valley, and Redb=
urn was at their head,=20

accompanied by the "General."  of, and, as occasionally happened when the w=
ork did go over the=20

hour, it was not, to use the mildest term, done with care, neatness, or acc=
uracy; it was, to use a=20

current phrase, "slammed off."  Every moment beyond five o'clock in which t=
he worker was asked=20

to do anything was by just so much an imposition on the part of the employe=
r, and so far as it=20

could be safely shown, this impression was gotten over to him.  There was a=
n entire unwillingness=20

to let business interfere with any anticipated pleasure or personal engagem=
ent.  The office was all=20

right between nine and five; one had to be there to earn a living; but afte=
r five, it was not to be=20

thought of for one moment.  The elevators which ran on the stroke of five w=
ere never large enough=20

to hold the throng which besieged them.  The talk during lunch hour rarely,=
 if ever, turned toward=20

business, except as said before, when it dealt with underpaid services.  In=
 the spring and summer=20

it was invariably of baseball, and scores of young men knew the batting ave=
rages of the different=20

players and the standing of the clubs with far greater accuracy than they k=
new the standing or the=20

discounts of the customers of their employers.  In the winter the talk was =
all of dancing, boxing, or=20

plays.  It soon became evident to Bok why scarcely five out of every hundre=
d of the young men=20

whom he knew made any business progress.  They were not interested; it was =
a case of a day's=20

work and a day's pay; it was not a question of how much one could do but=20

"I will now go forward and hold parley," said Harry, as he wrapped a kerchi=
ef about the muzzle of=20

his rifle-barrel. "If you see me fall, you can calculate that it's about ti=
me for you to sling in a chunk=20

of your lip."  He had fallen into the habit of talking in an illiterate fas=
hion, since his association with=20

the "General."  "All right," assented the old locater; "ef they try ter sal=
t ye, jes' giv' a with.  The=20

thought of how well one might do a given thing never seemed to occur to the=
 average mind.  "Oh,=20

what do you care?" was the favorite expression.  "The boss won't notice it =
if you break your back=20

over his work; you won't get any more pay."  And there the subject was dism=
issed, and thoroughly=20

dismissed, too.  Eventually, then, Bok learned that the path that led to su=
ccess was wide open: the=20
