yet their preference was to get up fires. They had been concerned as subord=
inates and screened=20

performers in a large incendiary fire at Whitechapel, in another at Manches=
ter, and, I also believe,=20

one in Liverpool.  After about sixteen months' waiting and watching--during=
 which time the=20

Newtons had made one or two pleasure-trips to the Continent, had resided at=
 various parts of the=20

metropolis in superior furnished apartments, and had patronised tailors ext=
ensively for various=20

costumes--I ascertained that they had resolved to re-commence business.  On=
e of them, Mr.=20

Henry Newton, went into the west of England, to the town of B----, and took=
 a large house and=20

shop there, which he opened as a music-seller's and a pianoforte warehouse.=
 Next door to the=20

goodly and capacious premises which Mr. Henry Newton had taken, was a small=
, dwarfed, and=20

not by any means pretty building. This had been not long before to let, but=
 had found a tenant=20

about a month or six weeks before Mr. Newton took the adjacent more pretent=
ious structure. The=20

small house was opened, in a humble way of business, by an old man and woma=
n. The old folk=20

sold lollipops, fruit, children's books, &c. Newton complained to the agent=
 of the low character of=20

this business, and went so far as to negotiate with the small shopkeeper fo=
r the surrender of his=20

tenancy in the premises; but the negotiation broke off, in consequence of t=
he small shopkeeper=20

demanding what Mr. Newton thought any thing but a small price for his inter=
est in the hovel. Mr.=20

Newton declared that he had an unconquerable objection, on principle, to be=
ing swindled or=20

robbed in that way. Rather than submit to the small shopkeeper's gross exto=
rtion, he said he=20

would put up with the nuisance, although it would interfere with the respec=
table business he=20

intended to carry on.  I ought to explain, that Mr. Newton did not appear i=
n the town under the=20

name of Newton. He set up there as "Keeling and Co., wholesale pianoforte m=
anufacturers,=20

dealers, and merchants." His establishment was called the "Temple of the Mu=
ses," and a very=20

pretty affair it was.  Mr. Albert Newton remained in London. He started, un=
der the title of "Cross=20

and Co.," as "general commission-agent, importer, and merchants," near Towe=
r Hill, and soon=20

found himself engaged in rather extensive operations at home and abroad. He=
 also served as a=20

reference for his brother, Mr. Keeling.  Mr. Keeling had not opened his pre=
mises long when he=20

slightly intimated his intention to insure the "Temple of the Muses." Sever=
al of the local agents of=20

insurance companies left at his premises circulars and prospectuses, inviti=
ng him thereby to insure=20

his life or his chattels, or both. He had interviews with two or three of t=
he agents about terms, and=20

was critical in comparing the different rates of their offices, the dates o=
f their foundation, the=20

respectability of their management, and all such other things as a prudent =
insurer would like to be=20

well informed about. The upshot or result was, that he effected an insuranc=
e through the local=20

agent of one of the oldest London offices (the title of which need not for =
the present be=20

mentioned), although it cost him a trifle more than was asked by the agent =
of a modern office,=20

because he had no belief, he said, in "mushroom concerns." The agent, who p=
rofited by it,=20

considered this decision a token of Mr. Keeling's sound practical judgment.=
  Several pianos=20

arrived, some large parcels of music, and other goods, which were duly take=
n from the railway=20

station to the "Temple of the Muses," by the railway servants, whose fatigu=
e was usually lightened=20

by a trifling _douceur_ from Messrs. Keeling and Co.  Messrs. Keeling's men=
, an assistant and a=20

porter, were brought by them from London. The principal had been heard to s=
ay that nobody but=20

London men could understand his suffered any injury.  That a storm of such =
magnitude and fury=20

should have swept through the heart of a city of 200,000 people, to destroy=
 outright no more than=20



five or six score lives, may excite our wonder. The most obvious reason of =
the low mortality will be=20

found in the hour and place of the principal visitation. The place was the =
business part of the city,=20

and the hour between eight and nine P.M., when the wholesale houses and the=
 streets in their=20

vicinity were comparatively deserted. Another fact is also to be noted. The=
 cyclone seems to have=20

reached the ground scarcely at any point at all. Its principal fury was pro=
bably expended in the=20

region above the housetops. The roofs and tops of walls were removed; the d=
amage below=20

resulted principally from their fall. Humbler buildings sheltering human li=
ves were sometimes=20

crushed by the fall of the upper portion of the wall of some contiguous bui=
lding; as notably, in the=20

case of the house occupied by the laundry girls, and which was smashed by t=
he fall of the wall=20

from the top story of the Louisville Hotel; or the case of a colored family=
 whose house was crushed=20

by the wall of the Falls City Hall. But in any case of cyclonic visitation =
 [Illustration: CORNER MAIN=20

AND CLINTON STREETS, LOUISVILLE.]  the escapes will probably amaze us more =
than the=20

deaths; for when it will seem that nothing living could have escaped, the m=
ajority will not only=20

probably be found alive, but absolutely unhurt. Of numerous cases, a few sp=
ecimens will suffice:=20

Peter Speth and family were seated in the parlor when the cyclone arrived. =
The family huddled=20

together in the hall, doubtless to avail themselves of the protection of th=
e side walls not far apart.=20

The walls of the second story fell in with a crash. The building and furnit=
ure were destroyed, but=20

the family escaped without injury.  Eleven men were in a barber shop at 180=
3 Broadway. The roof=20

was blown off; the walls fell in, but all the men escaped through the windo=
ws without a scratch.  At=20

329 Eleventh street, on the upper floor of a two-story brick, a lady lay at=
 the point of death;=20

watched by her son and daughter. She begged them to flee for their lives, b=
ut they refused to=20

forsake her. The roof was stripped clean off, but the devoted children with=
 their mother escaped=20

injury.  In one cottage on Chapel street dwelt a family of five. At once al=
l were in the house, when=20

the storm demolished it, and four escaped unhurt.  Major Galt, of the Louis=
ville and Nashville=20

Road, lived in a two-story brick. He apprehended no danger till the walls f=
ell. His wife was buried=20

under a pile of bricks. Her husband with difficulty extricated her, and car=
ried her unconscious to=20

the house of a neighbor. Save for the shock, she was not seriously hurt.  N=
ow, were such cases=20

the exception--had not such instances happened in a hundred other places si=
milarly visited--there=20

would certainly be cause for perplexity. But the phenomena of the Louisvill=
e storm tend only to=20

establish the truth of a fact long suspected: that the most  [Illustration:=
 LOOKING EAST FROM=20

TENTH AND MAIN, LOUISVILLE.]  destructive effects of a tornado are not alwa=
ys attributable to=20

the direct force of the wind. A number of interesting incidents of the Loui=
sville storm will serve to=20

illustrate a now clearly established fact.  Mrs. Fitzpatrick and her family=
 were in a two-story brick,=20

1433 Seventeenth street. They were all in an upper room and could not get o=
ut. The walls fell=20

outward, while the floor still remained in its place. They climbed down unh=
urt.  James Smith=20

(colored) lived with his wife and seven children in Congress Alley, in the =
rear of Falls City Hall.=20

Himself, his wife and three children were crushed beneath the mass of brick=
s and timbers; the=20

remaining four children were taken out more dead than alive. Yet, the house=
 was=20


_
people of B---- very well (especially the better classes), he could not put=
 up with the trade=20

assistants to be got in that town.  Shortly after the "Temple of the Muses"=
 was opened, the=20

proprietor was scandalised by a little stall having been put outside the ne=
xt house or hovel, with=20

ginger-beer and other trifling articles of refreshment upon it for sale, wh=
ich, indeed, seemed to be=20

displayed with a sort of vulgar ostentation by the proprietor, as Keeling s=
aid, as a sort of means to=20

annoy him, until he gave a fancy price in order to get rid of the fellow. I=
n this, however, the small=20

shopkeeper was not successful. Although Mr. Keeling's indignation and disgu=
st were intense, he=20

would not buy off the nuisance at the price demanded. He talked of going to=
 law with crushed by=20

the wall of the hall, which fell outward. Similar was the fate of the laund=
ry girls. The house in which=20

they were was crushed by the top of the wall of the Louisville Hotel, which=
 fell outward, toward the=20

wind.  The colored Odd Fellows were holding a meeting in their hall at Thir=
teenth and Walnut. The=20

two upper stories were blown entirely down. Several large circular holes we=
re blown through the=20

brick walls; one of these in the side away from the storm. Several received=
 more or less injury, but=20

not one was fatally hurt.  At 1315 Eighteenth street, was a magnificent new=
 brick cottage. The roof=20

remained, but in the west wall were made =E2=80=9Csix holes, round as a dol=
lar, and large enough to admit=20

a flour barrel.=E2=80=9D It is added that the missing bricks were=20


_
about an action or an indictment; but was advised that the annoyance was in=
sufficient to give him=20

the remedy he sought.  No business seemed to be done by Keeling and Co. A f=
ew pieces of music=20

were sold. A good many people called to see the pianos; but the prices aske=
d for them somewhat=20

alarmed the customers. Mr. Keeling occasionally got disgusted, and assured =
his visitors he could=20

not sell such articles as he had to sell at the prices they were expected t=
o be sold for, although he=20

knew that common trashy things could be supplied at those figures.  One day=
 there was a sale in=20

London of the stock of a pianoforte manufacturer advertised in the daily pa=
pers. It announced an=20

auction at some future day, unless the whole stock were previously disposed=
 of by private=20

contract, together with the lease and good-will of the manufacturer's premi=
ses. Mr. Keeling=20

received a telegram from Messrs. Cross, which ran thus: "See the _Times_. A=
dvertisement, sale=20

of Mr.----. Stock, good-will, &c."  Mr. Keeling, after receiving this teleg=
ram, was very anxious to see=20

the _Times_, which arrived in due course about mid-day. He sent to the rail=
way station two or=20

three times, and ultimately went up himself, to get an early copy of the pa=
per. On his way there he=20

met an acquaintance or two (one was my assistant, although he little dreamt=
 it), whom he told=20

there was a splendid opportunity, he thought, for buying a large stock, and=
 perhaps getting a first-

class Town business, to which his country trade of the "Temple of the Muses=
" might be added with=20

advantage. He thought he might also be able to get a stock of pianos, of ra=
ther lower quality than=20

he now had, which the people of B---- might appreciate at the price he coul=
d offer them. After he=20

had procured the _Times_, and taken care to explain to a few people the pre=
cise cause of his=20

journey to London, he only awaited the arrival of the next up-train, and aw=
ay he went to Town by=20

it. He expected to be down the next day, but found this impossible, as he e=
xplained in a telegram=20

to his assistant or shopman, but said that he would positively return on th=
e  Finally, take the=20

experience of a grocer on West Market street:  =E2=80=9CI was inside of my =
store, and my clerk was there,=20

too. Standing on the pavement outside were policeman Harlow, a man named Ch=
arles Taylor,=20

who said he lived in Jeffersonville, a negro whose name I do not know, and =
Carl Rice, an eight-

year-old boy who lived with his parents in the rooms above my store. When t=
he wind grew high=20

and the hail began to pelt, Mr. Harlow attempted to open the front door of =
the store, which was=20

closed, to come inside for shelter. At that moment the tornado came in all =
its fury. No one who was=20

not in it can conceive of its terrific force. The suction from without, as =
the full force came, was so=20

great that it was impossible to get the front door open. My clerk at work o=
n it on the inside and Mr.=20

Harlow on the outside, were as powerless against the wind as babies would h=
ave been in=20

attempting to move a stone wall.  =E2=80=9CBut their efforts were not of lo=
ng duration. The tornado forced its=20

way in the rear of the upper stories of my building, and with impetuosity u=
nequaled forged through=20

the apartments against the front wall. This wall popped out and fell to the=
 pavement below, upon=20

those standing there, burying them in the debris. The front is entirely gon=
e, as you see. Mr. Harlow=20

and the little boy Carl Rice, were close up to the front door, and only a s=
mall portion of the wall=20

struck them. Taylor and the negro were out on the pavement further, and the=
y fared worse.=20

Taylor=E2=80=99s leg was broken at the ankle, and he was internally injured=
. The negro had a hole knocked=20

in his skull larger than a silver dollar, and was used up generally. Mr. Ha=
rlow was bruised, but=20

fortunately has no bones broken, and is not dangerously hurt. The little bo=
y=E2=80=99s head was pretty=20

badly cut and bruised, but he is not in a serious condition.=E2=80=9D  Now,=
 in all of these cases is noticeable=20

the same peculiar feature of walls falling outward, sometimes even against =
the wind: or of holes=20



being burst in walls, the bricks being  [Illustration: CORNER JEFFERSON AND=
 TWELFTH=20

STREETS, LOUISVILLE.]  thrown so far that they could not be=20


_
On the second night after Mr. Keeling's departure for London, about a quart=
er to twelve o'clock,=20

there was a cry of fire in the town of B----. The little hovel had caught l=
ight in the rear, and it=20

happened that this wretched place actually joined the "Temple of other hous=
es. This might seem=20

inexplicable--that the windward walls often fall outward. But it must be re=
membered that all storms=20

with a wind system blowing spirally upward and inward are characterized by =
low barometer,=20

signifying a diminution in atmospheric=20
