but in a different way; he looked bronzed and weather-beaten, and much olde=
r than he really was.=20

=E2=80=9CI remember now,=E2=80=9D Henri resumed after a pause. =E2=80=9CI s=
aw you during the Occupation, in a church in=20

Moscow. After the service some Russians attacked me, and I might have been =
killed, but for that=20

brave fellow with one hand. He appealed to you, and you protected me. Ah!=
=E2=80=9D he added with a sigh,=20

=E2=80=9Cif I had known then what sufferings were before me, I might have p=
rayed you to plunge your=20

sword into my breast!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am glad to find you amongst the =
living,=E2=80=9D Ivan said kindly.  =E2=80=9CAnd that day,=E2=80=9D=20

mused Henri, =E2=80=9Cwas little more than three months ago, while it is bu=
t two since we left Moscow.=20

Were there ever two such months since the beginning of the world?=E2=80=9D =
 =E2=80=9COf suffering?--I think not,=E2=80=9D=20

said Ivan thoughtfully, as he took a seat beside him.  =E2=80=9COf sufferin=
g for us, of glory for _you_. How=20

you must triumph, you Russians! Five months ago Napoleon crossed your borde=
r with half a=20

million of men; and now the miserable remains of that splendid host are dyi=
ng in your hospitals,=20

pensioners of your bounty. Surely such an overthrow was never seen since Ph=
araoh and his=20

armies perished in the waters of the Red Sea!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHow we tri=
umph, we Russians!=E2=80=9D Ivan repeated.=20

=E2=80=9CShould you like to know how? Our Emperor said the other day in con=
fidence to a friend, =E2=80=98This=20

miserable campaign has cost me ten years of my life!=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9C_Miserable!_ when it has been for him=20

and his one long glorious victory!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTrue; but the sufferi=
ngs he has witnessed have well-nigh=20

broken his heart.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe sufferings _of his enemies_,=E2=80=
=9D said Henri, as tears filled his eyes.  =E2=80=9CThey=20

have so cast our own into the shade, that we ourselves almost forget them. =
Yet you must not think=20

we have suffered nothing. Remember Moscow, our beautiful, our holy city; re=
member Borodino=20



and the other battles in which the best blood of our country was poured out=
 like water. Moreover,=20

the ice-king has thinned our ranks as well as yours.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh!=
 not so fatally.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo; we had wholesome=20

food, and warm clothing, and care and comforts for the sick. As a rule, our=
 invalids recovered,=20

while yours died. Yes, oh yes, God has surely given us a great deliverance;=
 would it had been at=20

less cost to others! Look here, monsieur,=E2=80=9D--Ivan took a silver meda=
l, new and bright, from his neck,=20

where it hung attached to a sky-blue ribbon. =E2=80=9CThe Czar has just giv=
en one of these to every man=20

who has borne part in this winter=E2=80=99s campaign, from the general to t=
he youngest recruit.=E2=80=9D  Henri=20

examined it with interest. One side bore a Triangle surrounded by rays, and=
 in its centre an Eye.=20

=E2=80=9CWhat does that mean?=E2=80=9D he inquired.  =E2=80=9CIt is, with u=
s, the symbol of the Divine Presence,=E2=80=9D Ivan=20

answered, crossing himself. =E2=80=9CIt typifies the All-seeing and Ever-pr=
esent--the Three in One.=20

Beneath, you read =E2=80=981812,=E2=80=99 the ever-memorable year when He h=
imself interposed to deliver us.=20

Now, turn the other side.=E2=80=9D  Henri did so, and saw, though he could =
not read, an inscription in the=20

old Slavonic tongue.  =E2=80=9CThat is, translated literally, =E2=80=98_Not=
 us! not us! but His Name!_=E2=80=99 In your French=20

Bible--the same which I use also--the verse reads thus:--=E2=80=98Not unto =
us, O Lord, not unto us, but=20

unto thy name give glory.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBeautiful!=E2=80=9D s=
aid Henri; and as he gave back the medal, he looked with=20

interest at the brilliant young Guardsman, who spoke in such a simple, manl=
y, unaffected way of=20

God=E2=80=99s Word and Providence.  =E2=80=9CTo-morrow the Czar leaves this=
,=E2=80=9D said Ivan, replacing his medal.=20

=E2=80=9CWe of the Chevalier Guard go also, of course.=E2=80=9D  Henri=E2=
=80=99s cry of distress made all the sick men in=20

the ward raise their heads.  =E2=80=9CWhat is the matter?=E2=80=9D Ivan ask=
ed compassionately.  =E2=80=9CThe Emperor is=20

going!=E2=80=9D Henri said, or rather sobbed, for so weak was he that he co=
uld not restrain his tears.  =E2=80=9CYou=20

need not be afraid that will change anything, my poor friend. He has made a=
rrangements for the=20

safety and the comfort of all the prisoners. Henceforth they will want for =
nothing.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI was not afraid=20

of wanting food or shelter,=E2=80=9D Henri said. =E2=80=9CBut, M. le Garde,=
 when I lay in that horrible prison, dying in=20

black despair, it was _his_ voice called me back from the gates of the grav=
e, and showed me what=20

the mercy of God was like. I would give half the little life left in me to =
hear that voice yet once=20

again.=E2=80=9D After a pause he added, with an effort to control himself, =
=E2=80=9CStill, he stayed among us longer=20

than we could have dared to hope. Is he going home now?=E2=80=9D  Ivan shoo=
k his head. =E2=80=9CHis work is not=20

half done yet; nor ours,=E2=80=9D he said.  =E2=80=9CWhat will you fight fo=
r now?=E2=80=9D asked Henri with a sad smile. =E2=80=9CFor=20

vengeance?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CFor _peace_,=E2=80=9D returned Ivan. =E2=80=
=9CShall I tell you what the Czar says about that? He=20

speaks without anger or bitterness of your Emperor.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCall=
 him not _mine_,=E2=80=9D Henri interrupted,=20

with a flush on his pale cheek. =E2=80=9CMine he never was. I am a Royalist=
.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, then, of Napoleon.=20

=E2=80=98What a brilliant career,=E2=80=99 said the Czar, =E2=80=98that man=
 might have run! He could have given peace to=20

Europe--he could have done it; and he has not. Now the charm is broken.=E2=
=80=99=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAt least you Russians=20

cannot regret that,=E2=80=9D said Henri with enthusiasm; =E2=80=9Cfor the o=
live crown of the peace-maker which=20

Napoleon has put aside awaits the brow of Alexander.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CSo =
said the friend to whom the Czar was=20

speaking.[46] =E2=80=98If only peace is made,=E2=80=99 was his answer, =E2=
=80=98what does it matter by whom, whether by=20

him, or by me, or by another?=E2=80=99 It is a good time to think of peace,=
=E2=80=9D Ivan added. =E2=80=9CTo-morrow will be=20

Christmas day, when peace and good-will upon earth were sung by the angels.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTo-morrow?=E2=80=9D=20

repeated Henri. =E2=80=9CAm I dreaming? Surely I remember noticing that one=
 of the first blessed, restful=20

days I spent here was Christmas day.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou forget,=E2=80=
=9D said Ivan with a smile, =E2=80=9Cthat we Russians are=20

behind the Western world by twelve days. Our Christmas is your feast of the=
 Epiphany. After=20

anything.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CStrange,=E2=80=9D said Henri--=E2=80=9Cstrange=

=E2=80=99[47] But, my friend, I must=20

e clasped Henri=E2=80=99s hand warmly,=20

and contrived to leave in it a few pieces of gold. Henri tried to remonstra=
te, but was quickly=20

silenced. =E2=80=9CSoldiers always help one another; that is a matter of co=
urse. If you like,=E2=80=9D added Ivan,=20

with a touch of playful malice, =E2=80=9Cyou can repay me after the first F=
rench victory. Good-bye.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat=20

a fine young fellow!=E2=80=9D thought Ivan as he left the hospital; =E2=80=
=9Cso grateful and so patient. And I have=20

forgotten even to ask his name! How thoughtless of me! Too late to return n=
ow. But I am sure he is=20

well born, particularly since he calls himself a Royalist. Probably he belo=
ngs to one of those noble=20

families of the old _r=C3=A9gime_ Napoleon delights to oppress and humble.=
=E2=80=9D  Over Ivan himself great=20

changes had passed, and were passing even then. Perhaps his share in the fo=
regoing=20

conversation has already indicated these with sufficient clearness; if not,=
 his conduct during the=20

events that have yet to follow may complete the picture.  Amongst the works=
 of faith and love=20

which in all ages have been inspired by the precepts and the example of =E2=
=80=9Cthe forgiving Christ,=E2=80=9D the=20

labours of Alexander on behalf of his perishing enemies undoubtedly deserve=
 a place. It is good=20

for the world to keep such deeds in remembrance, although to those who do t=
hem the world=E2=80=99s=20

remembrance may avail but little. It was not the motive that inspired, nor =
will it be the reward that=20

crowns them.  A few years later, at Cherson in the Crimea, Alexander stood =
beside the grave of a=20



philanthropist whose character and work he held in genuine veneration--John=
 Howard, the=20

prisoners=E2=80=99 friend. With his own hand he designed a monument to mark=
