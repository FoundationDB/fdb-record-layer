talking of what had happened so far on their camping trip.  Toward evening =
Long Gun went out to=20

the supply tent to get some meat to cook. He came back in a hurry, his face=
 showing much=20

surprise.  "What's the matter?" asked Jack quickly.  "Meat gone!" exclaimed=
 the Indian.=20

"Something take him from tent." full and willing obedience?  ONE LAW, NOT T=
EN.  These ten=20

commandments are not ten different laws; they are one law. If I am being he=
ld up in the air by a=20

chain with ten links and I break one of them, down I come, just as surely a=
s if I break the whole=20

ten. If I am forbidden to go out of an enclosure, it makes no difference at=
 what point I break=20

through the fence. "Whosoever shall keep the whole=20


_
The boys rushed out into the storm toward the smaller canvas shelter where =
their food and=20

supplies were kept. One side had been torn down, and within there was a sce=
ne of confusion.  In=20

the fierceness of the storm, while the campers had been in the big tent, so=
me wild beast, or,=20

perhaps, several of them, had stolen up and carried away most of the food o=
n which Jack and his=20

chums depended. Nor could it be said what beasts had robbed them, for their=
 tracks were=20

obliterated by the snow that had fallen since.  "Well, this is tough luck!"=
 exclaimed Jack. "What are=20

we going to do now?"  "There's some bacon left from breakfast," said Budge.=
 "Have to eat that, I=20

guess."  "Yes; and, thank goodness, the thieves didn't care for coffee," ad=
ded Nat. "We sha'n't=20

starve, at least, to-night."  "There's some canned stuff left, too," went o=
n Will.  "But it won't last=20

long, if this storm keeps up," spoke Jack seriously. "I guess we're going t=
o be up against it,=20

fellows."  "Like fish?" asked Long Gun suddenly.  "What have fish got to do=
 with it?" inquired Bony.=20

"Catch fish through ice soon. Storm stop," replied the Indian. "River plent=
y full fish."  "That's a=20

good idea," commented Jack. "But when will the blizzard stop?"  It kept up =
all that night and part of=20

the next day. The campers were on short rations, as regards meat, though th=
ere was law and yet=20

offend in one point, he is guilty of all." "The golden chain of obedience i=
s broken if one link is=20

missing."  We sometimes hear people pray to be preserved from certain sins,=
 as if they were in no=20

danger of committing others. I firmly believe that if a man begins by wilfu=
lly breaking one of these=20

commandments it is much easier for him to break the others. I know of a gen=
tleman who had a=20

confidential clerk, and insisted on his going down Sunday morning to work o=
n his books. The=20

young man had a good deal of principle, and at first refused, but he was an=
xious to keep in the=20

good graces of his employer and finally yielded. He had not done that a gre=
at while before he=20

speculated in stocks, and became a defaulter for $120,000. The employer had=
 him arrested and=20

put in the penitentiary for ten years, but I believe he was just as guilty =
in the sight of God as that=20

young man, for he led him to take the first step on the downward road. You =
remember the story of=20

a soldier who was smuggled into a fortress in a load of hay, and opened the=
 gates to his=20

comrades. Every sin we commit opens the door for other sins.  ALL HAVE COME=
 SHORT.  For=20

fifteen hundred years man was under the law, and no one was equal to it. Ch=
rist came and=20

showed that the commandments went beyond the mere letter; and can any one s=
ince say that he=20

has been=20


_
beans, and enough hardtack for some time yet, while there was flour that co=
uld be made into=20

biscuits. But they needed meat, or something like it, in that cold climate.=
  It was late the next=20

afternoon when Jack, looking from the tent, announced:  "Hurrah, fellows! I=
t's stopped snowing,=20

and the wind has gone down. Now for some fish through the ice. Long Gun, co=
me on and show us=20

how."  The Indian got some lines and hooks ready, using salt pork for bait.=
 Then the whole party=20

went down to the river, traveling on snowshoes, for there was a great them =
in his own strength?=20

As the plummet is held up, we see how much we are out of the perpendicular.=
 As we measure=20

ourselves by that holy standard, we find how much we are lacking. As a chil=
d said, when reproved=20

by her mother and told that she ought to do right: "How can I do right when=
 there is no 'right' in=20

me?" All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. There is none righ=
teous, no, not one.  I=20

do not say that all are equally guilty of gross violations of the commandme=
nts. It needs a certain=20

amount of reckless courage openly to=20


_
It was no easy task to scrape away the white blanket and get down to the ic=
e that covered the=20

river, but they managed it. Holes were chopped in the frozen surface of the=
 stream, and then they=20

all began to fish. They had good luck, and soon had caught enough of the fi=
nny residents of the=20

Shoshone to make a good meal.  "Um-um!" exclaimed Bony, as they sat down to=
 supper a little=20

later. "Maybe this doesn't break a law, human or divine; but it is easy to =
_crack_ them, as the child=20

said. It has been remarked that the life of many professors of religion is =
full of fractures that result=20

from little sins, little acts of temper and selfishness. It is possible to =
crack a costly vase so finely=20

that it cannot be noticed by the observer; but let this be done again and a=
gain in different=20

directions, and some day the=20
