was the core and=20

center of their pillage. Here was the capital ready to their hands. They pr=
oceeded to levy upon, to=20

divided the U.S.A. into twelve financial satrapies or dependencies or loot =
areas with centers of=20

pillage thusly: New York, Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Minneapo=
lis, Kansas City, St.=20

Louis, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas. Upon every National B=
ank in the U.S.A.=20

there was levied a capital tribute of six per cent of their capital and sur=
plus account for subscribed=20

capital to the Federal Reserve Bank set over them. Of this amount one-half =
or three per cent was=20

required to be immediately paid in and the other half was held subject to c=

The English wanted not courage or resolution, but could not discover nor fi=

with, yet were galled by the enemy.=E2=80=9D In the arts of ambush and surp=
rise, with which the Indians=20

were so familiar, the colonists were without practice. It is to the want of=
 this experience, purchased=20

at a very dear rate in the course of the war, that we must ascribe the nume=
rous surprises and=20

defeats from which the colonists suffered at its commencement.  Driven to t=
he necessity of=20

defensive warfare, those in command on the river determined to establish a =
magazine and=20

garrison at Hadley. Captain Lathrop, who had been dispatched from the eastw=
ard to the=20

assistance of the river towns, was sent with eighty men, the flower of the =
youth of Essex County,=20

to guard the wagons intended to convey to Hadley three thousand bushels of =
unthreshed wheat,=20

the produce of the fertile Deerfield meadows. Just before arriving at Deerf=
ield, near a small stream=20

still known as Bloody Brook, under the shadow of the abrupt conical Sugar L=
oaf, the southern=20

termination of the Deerfield mountain, Lathrop, on September 18, fell into =
an ambush, and, after a=20

brave resistance, perished there with all his company. Captain Moseley, sta=
tioned at Deerfield,=20

marched to his assistance, but arrived too late to help him. Deerfield was =
abandoned, and burned=20

by the Indians. Springfield, about the same time, was set on fire, but was =
partially saved by the=20

arrival, with troops from Connecticut, of Major Treat, successor to the lat=
ely deceased Mason in=20

the chief command of the Connecticut forces. An attack on Hatfield was vigo=
rously repelled by the=20

garrison.  Meanwhile, hostilities were spreading; the Indians on the Merrim=
ac began to attack the=20



towns in their vicinity, and the whole of Massachusetts was soon in the utm=
ost alarm. Except in=20

the immediate neighborhood of Boston, the country still remained an immense=
 forest dotted by a=20

few openings. The frontier settlements could not be defended against a foe =
familiar with localities,=20

scattered in small parties, skilful in concealment, and watching with patie=
nce for some unguarded=20

or favorable moment. Those settlements were mostly broken up, and the inhab=
itants, retiring=20

Suppose the lustful eyes of the Federal Reserve lootage had turned to the d=
rygoods instead of to=20

the banking business. They would have compelled every drygoods merchant in =
the U.S.A. to=20

contribute six per cent of his capital and surplus--with one-half immediate=
ly payable--to set up a=20

drygoods jobbing house in the center of a designated loot area. They would =
have compelled every=20

drygoods merchant to purchase his merchandise from that jobbing house at th=
eir price. Isn't one=20

proposition as sane as the other? Of course it is. But there is this differ=
ence. By commandeering=20

capital for the drygoods business licensed looters _could control only the =
drygoods business_. But=20

by commandeering capital for the banking business licensed looters _could c=
ontrol all business_!=20

That's the difference and that's all the difference. They commandeered capi=
tal where it could=20

_control not one Indians, and the small dependent and tributary tribes, bec=
ame objects of=20

suspicion and terror. They had been employed at first as scouts and auxilia=
ries, and to good=20

advantage; but some few, less confirmed in the faith, having deserted to th=
e enemy, the whole=20

body of them were denounced as traitors. Eliot the apostle, and Gookin, sup=
erintendent of the=20

headlong fury, to which several of the magistrates opposed but a feeble res=
istance. Troops were=20

sent to break up the praying villages at Mendon, Grafton, and others in tha=

Indians, =E2=80=9Cthose poor despised sheep of Christ,=E2=80=9D as Gookin a=
ffectionately calls them, were hurried=20

iciently frightful,=20

superstition, as usual, added bugbears of her own. Indian bows were seen in=
