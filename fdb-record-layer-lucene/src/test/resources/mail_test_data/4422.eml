would not at all       afford serious proof that there are personal, living=

ha       (Odpag-med)=20

have now become personal Gods, ruling over and living in       the celestia=

Tushita (Tibetan: Devachan);       while Adi-Buddhi, of the philosophic Hin=
du, and Amita Buddha of=20

the       philosophic Chinaman and Tibetan, are names for universal, primev=
al       ideas.    727 See=20

_Theosophist_ for March, 1882.    728 The intimate relation of the twenty-f=
ive Buddhas=20

(Bodhisattvas) with       the twenty-five Tattvas (the Conditioned or Limit=
ed) of the Hindus       is=20

interesting.    729 It is curious to note the great importance given by Eur=
opean       Orientalists to=20

the Dalai Lamas of Lhassa, and their utter ignorance       as to the Tda-sh=
u (or Teshu) Lamas,=20

while it is the latter who began       the hierarchical series of Buddha-in=
carnations, and are _de=20

facto_       the "popes" in Tibet; the Dalai Lamas are the creations of Nab=

 Tsong Kha-pa, though=20

very few seem to be aware of       that fact.    730 The chanting of a Mant=
ra is not a prayer, but=20

rather a magical       sentence in which the law of Occult causation connec=
ts itself with,       and=20

depends on, the will and acts of its singer. It is a is afraid."  "I not on=
ly confess it, but am proud of=20

it," returned the Gascon; "I'm not such a rhinoceros as you are. Oho! what'=
s that?"  "The=20

Lightning," answered the captain, "our felucca."  "So far, so good," laughe=
d Athos.  They went on=20

board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for th=
em--a cabin which was=20

to serve for all purposes and for the whole party; he then tried to slip aw=
ay under pretext of giving=20

orders to some one.  "Stop a moment," cried D'Artagnan; "pray how many men =
have you on=20

board, captain?"  "I don't understand," was the reply.  "Explain it, Athos.=
"  Groslow, on the question=20

being interpreted, answered, "Three, without counting myself."  D'Artagnan =
understood, for while=20

replying the captain had raised three fingers. "Oh!" he exclaimed, "I begin=
 to be more at my ease,=20

however, whilst you settle yourselves, I shall make the round of the boat."=
  "As for me," said=20

Porthos, "I will see to the supper."  "A very good idea, Porthos," said the=
 Gascon. "Athos lend me=20

Grimaud, who in the society of his friend Parry has perhaps picked up a lit=
tle English, and can act=20

as my interpreter."  "Go, Grimaud," said Athos.  D'Artagnan, finding a lant=
ern on the deck, took it=20

up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain, in English, "Come,=
" (being, with the classic=20

English oath, the only English words he knew), and so saying he descended t=
o the lower deck.=20

This was divided into three compartments--one which was covered by the floo=
r of that room in=20

which Athos, Porthos and Aramis were to pass the night; the second was to s=
erve as the sleeping-

room for the servants, the third, under the=20


_
of Sanskrit sounds, and when its string of words and sentences is       pro=
nounced according to the=20

magical formulae in the _Atharva Veda_,       but understood by the few, so=
me Mantras produce=20

an instantaneous and       very wonderful effect. In its esoteric sense it =
contains the Vach       (the=20

"mystic speech"), which resides in the Mantra, or rather in its       sound=
s, since it is according to=20

the vibrations, one way or the       other, of ether that the effect is pro=
duced. The "sweet singers"=20

were called by that name because they were experts in Mantras. Hence       =
the legend in China=20

that the singing and melody of the Lohans are       heard at dawn by the pr=
iests from their cells in=20

the monastery of       Fang-Kwang. (See _Biography of Chi-Kai_ in Tien-tai-=
nan-tchi.)    731 The=20

celebrated Lohan, Madhyantika, who converted the king and whole       count=
ry of Kashmir to=20

Buddhism, sent a body of Lohans to preach the       Good Law. He was the sc=
ulptor who raised to=20

Buddha the famous statue       one hundred feet high, which Hiuen-Tsaung sa=
w at Dardu, to the=20

north       of the Punjab. As the same Chinese traveller mentions a temple =
ten       Li from=20

Peshawur--350 feet round and 850 feet high--which was at his       time (A.=
D. 550) already 850=20

years old, Koeppen thinks that so far       back as 292 B.C. Buddhism was t=
he prevalent religion in=20

the Punjab.    732 A title of the which Mordaunt was concealed.  "Oho!" cri=
ed D'Artagnan, as he=20

went down the steps of the hatchway, preceded by the lantern, "what a numbe=
r of barrels! one=20

would think one was in the cave of Ali Baba. What is there in them?" he add=
ed, putting his lantern=20

on one of the casks.  The captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again, bu=
t controlling himself=20

he answered:  "Port wine."  "Ah! port wine! 'tis a comfort," said the Gasco=
n, "since we shall not die=20

of thirst. Are they all full?"  Grimaud translated the question, and Groslo=
w, who was wiping the=20

perspiration from off his forehead, answered:  "Some full, others empty."  =
D'Artagnan struck the=20

barrels with his hand, and having ascertained that he spoke the truth, push=
ed his lantern, greatly=20

to the captain's alarm, into the interstices between the barrels, and findi=
ng that there was nothing=20

concealed in them:  "Come along," he said; and he went toward the door of t=
he second=20

compartment.  "Stop!" said the Englishman, "I have the key of that door;" a=
nd he opened the door,=20

with a trembling hand, into the second compartment, where Mousqueton and Bl=
aisois were=20

preparing supper.  Here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend=
 and they passed=20

rapidly to examine the third compartment.  This was the room appropriated t=
o the sailors. Two or=20

three hammocks hung upon the ceiling, a table and two benches composed the =
entire furniture.=20
