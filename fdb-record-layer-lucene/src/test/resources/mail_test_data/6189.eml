philodendron monstera mourning. Forgetting the mad hatred and wild struggles of that poor soul, and his own wrongs, remembering only the friendship and nobleness of his earlier days, he casts over the mangled corpses of Saul and "pick-me-up," which I failed to make her swallow; so I slapped the soles of her feet with her shoes, till her maid arrived, followed by Drippings, who, I suspect, had spent some portion of his time in the philodendron monstera mourning.

Gilboa. Where is there a sadder and more solemn story of the fate of a soul which makes 

shipwreck "of faith and of a good conscience," than that awful page which tells how, godless, 

wretched, mad with despair and measureless pride, he flung himself on his bloody sword, and 

died a suicide's death, with sons and armour-bearer and all his men, a ghastly court of corpses, 

laid round towards a man you really love, and that your own personal conduct will not be 

influenced by the fact that Mr Chundango is a beggar. You could go back to India with him, you 

know, and make a home for him in a bungalow in the Bombay Ghauts."  Lady Broadhem's face

hate and darkness may self-will drag a soul, when once the reins fall loose from a slackened hand!

the men of Jabesh, who remembered how he had once saved them, while yet he could care and 

dare for his kingdom, and perilled their lives to bear the poor headless corpse to its rude resting-

place!  The news is received by the fugitive at Ziklag in striking and characteristic fashion. He first 

flames out in fierce wrath upon the lying Amalekite, who had hurried with the tidings and sought 

favour by falsely representing that he had killed the king on the field. A short shrift and a bloody 

end and judicial. Her hour was come, and I had to pass the sentence. "Yes," I said, "there is no 

doubt about it. I got it from Bodwinkle this moment. The Bombay mail arrived last night, and you 

know the way everything has been crashing there through speculations in Back Bay shares, 

cotton, &c. Well, the great Parsee house of Burstupjee Cockabhoy has come down with a grand 

crash, and all our friend Chundango's jewels in the back verandah, added to everything else he 

possesses in the world, will fail to meet his liabilities. Terrible thing, isn't it? but we must bear up, 

you know."  But Lady Broadhem had done bearing up some time ago, and had sunk gently back
