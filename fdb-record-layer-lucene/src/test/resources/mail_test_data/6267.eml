now," his voice changed, "there is other work to be done--dangerous work. T=
his island," he=20

pointed once again, "is our present destination."  "Not Mindanao then, sir?=
" Kentucky heaved a=20

sigh of disappointment, for the Commander had pointed to a small island jus=
t inside a coral reef.=20

"Not Mindanao this time." The Commander smiled. "This is to be a step in th=
at direction. At=20

present we do not have a force large enough for that undertaking. But some =
time we'll hit=20

Mindanao, and hit it hard," he added.  "That's good news, sir," said Kentuc=
ky.  "Now we have=20

another mission." The Commander's voice dropped. "The troops we are convoyi=

nutritive functions. But in the second condition the internal processes of =

activity of the cutaneous surface, and severe organic and nervous derangeme=
nts follow.  In the=20

summer season the temperature rises to 32.3=C2=B0 C. (90=C2=B0 F.) and even=
 much higher in certain=20

localities. During the prevalence of such heat, the mortality among young c=

o pieces!" Kentucky=20

beamed.  "We hope to. But first," the Commander weighed his words, "we may =
run into trouble.=20

And that's where you boys come in."  "What sort of trouble, sir?" Ted asked=
 quickly.  "Land-based=20

torpedo planes, perhaps." The Commander spoke slowly. "We are not quite sur=
e the Japs have=20

them. We do know there's a landing field on the island."  "We'll take them =
fast enough if they come=20

after us, sir." Kentucky squared his shoulders.  "At night it is not so eas=
y," was the quiet reply.=20

"Night!" Ted stared.  "Your squadron has been making practice flights at ni=
ght recently," said the=20

Commander. "That wasn't for fun."  "I--I suppose not." Ted was trying to th=
ink what going after=20

torpedo bombers at night would be like. "Exciting," he told himself. "And v=
ery dangerous."  "In the=20

past," the Commander spoke once more, "our task forces have been destroying=
 their torpedo=20

planes long before they reached us in the daytime. So--"  "So they're going=
 to come after us in the=20

dark, sir?" Kentucky suggested.  "Our Intelligence Service has strongly hin=
ted at it," said the=20

Commander. "So," he drew a deep breath, "I thought you, Kentucky, would lik=
e to call for four=20

volunteers to be ready for night fighting, just in case they come after us.=

and usual phenomena are exhaustion, unconsciousness, stertorous respiration=

 seems one of=20

"Sure have, same kind of a plane," said Ted.  "Good. Then you're on," Kentu=

in the vicinity of the island by midnight," said the Commander. "Have your =

"We won't forget, sir." There was a look of determination on Kentucky's lea=

"Remember, fellows," Kentucky called just before they parted, "the thing to=
 do is to rip right in and=20

get them confused. That way they'll think there are a lot of us."  "And the=
y'll start shooting one=20
