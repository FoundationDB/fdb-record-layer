hat the safe could not=20

be reached, so they asked Bunker about the money that was outside. Bunker p=
ointed to a little=20

tray full of small coins, and while Bob was putting them without the troubl=
e of picking them from=20

the Bunches; then put them in a Bag, made of Horse-Hair, and press them til=

discharged; put this Liquor into a Stone Jar, leaving it uncover'd for some=
 Days, then close it and=20

keep it for use. This=20


_
Bunker made a dash through a rear window. Pitts fired at him twice, the bul=

right shoulder."       [Group showing St. Paul police department, J.J. Conn=

ng outside and started=20

to leave. Heywood, who had been on the floor, unfortunately rose at this in=
stant, and Pitts, still=20

under the influence of liquor, shot him through the head and killed him."  =
"Meantime we who had=20

escaped slaughter in the terrible bombardment we had faced were trying to m=
ake our way to some=20

safe place. Not far from Northfield we met a farmer, who lent us a horse fo=
r Pitts to ride, and we=20

got past Dundas ahead of the news of the raid on the bank. We were also bea=
ting it at Millersburg,=20

but at Shieldsville we ran into a squad of men who knew what had happened a=
nd were after us.=20

These men had, foolishly for themselves, left their guns outside a house, a=

has a much greater influence in the way of Callico-Printing; but is harder =
to come at, few People=20

being willing to gather their Grapes unripe; but where there is a large Qua=
ntity, it is well worth=20

while. _N.B._ It will do well, if the Liquor is put into common Casks, but =
is nicer to the Palate if it is=20

kept in glazed Jars of about eight or nine Gallons, and the Berries might t=
hen be pick'd from the=20

Stalks. Keep this in a good Vault, and it will remain good for three or fou=
r Years as Verjuice; but a=20

little more time will make it lose its Sourness, and it will become like Wi=
ne.  The Verjuice of Crab-

Apples should be made of the wild Crab, which produces Thorns on its Branch=
es, and brings a=20

small round Apple, such as are common to be planted for Fences. I am the mo=
re particular in this,=20

because some Apples, which are call'd Wildings, are supposed to have a shar=
p juice, but such will=20

soften by keeping a Year or two. Take the Crabs, I speak of, in _October_, =
and grind them in a=20

Mill, such as they use for making Cyder; then press the Liquor, and put it =
into Vessels like the=20

former. Besides the agreeable Taste this=20


_
hold of them until we had a good start, but they overtook us about four mil=
es away and shots were=20

exchanged without any trouble resulting."  "Soon there were a thousand men =
on our trail and=20

about $5,000 in rewards for our capture. We tramped and camped and rode and=
 watched in a=20

strange country and among the lakes. We didn't know the trails and were afr=
aid to try the fords=20

and bridges, knowing that our hunters would be sure to keep their eyes on t=
hese places. Saturday=20

morning we abandoned our horses and decided to keep up the fight afoot. We =
tramped all night=20

and put in Sunday near Marysburg. Bob's elbow by this time was in pretty ba=
d shape and we had=20

to go slow. Finally, on Monday night and Tuesday we couldn't go anywhere, s=
o we passed the=20

time in a deserted house near Mankato. A man named Dunning found us there a=
nd we took him=20

prisoner. On the theory that the dead are silent, some of the men wanted to=
 kill him, but I wouldn't=20

stand for that, so we made him swear by all that was holy that he wouldn't =
tell that he had seen us=20

until we got away. Then we turned him loose. He lost no time in getting int=
o Mankato and giving=20

the alarm, and in a few minutes another posse was after us."  "That night H=
oward and Wood=20

decided that they wouldn't hold back any longer and that we were losing val=
uable time because of=20

Bob's wound, so they left us and went on west. They stole two horses very s=
oon, and this helped=20

us as well as them, for the posse followed the trail of the stolen horses, =
not knowing that we had=20

divided."  "On Thursday morning, September 21, just two weeks after the rai=
d, the end came. A=20

party of forty men soon surrounded us and opened fire. We were cut off from=
 our horses and our=20

case was hopeless. We were on the open prairie and not ready for our last f=
light against such=20

odds, we fell back into the Watonwan river bottoms and hid in some bushes."=
  "When the iron=20

doors shut behind us at the Stillwater prison we all submitted to the priso=
n discipline with the same=20

unquestioning obedience that I had exacted during my military service. The =
result was that we=20

gained friends both in prison and outside. We had been in prison a little o=
ver seven years, when,=20

on January 25, 1884, the main building was destroyed by fire at night. Geor=
ge F. Dodd was then=20

connected with the prison, while his wife was matron. There was danger of a=
 panic and a terrible=20

disaster. Dodd released Jim and Bob and myself. To me he gave a revolver. J=
im had an axe=20

handle and Bob a small iron bar. We stood guard over the women prisoners, m=
arched them from=20

the danger of the fire, and the prison authorities were kind enough to say =
that had it not been for=20

us there must have been a tremendous loss of life."         [Head Officials=

Travelling Powder, for Sauce, or Pocket-Sauce. From _Mynheer Vanderport_ of=
 _Antwerp._  Take=20

pickled Mango, and let it dry three or four Days in the Room; then reduce i=
t to Powder by means of=20

a Grater. Take of this Powder six Ounces, to which add three Ounces of Mush=
rooms, dry'd in a=20

gentle Oven, and reduced to Powder, by beating in a Mortar; add to this, a =
Dram of Mace=20

powder'd, half as much Cloves powder'd; or in their room, a large Nutmeg gr=
ated, and a Dram of=20

black Pepper, beat fine: mix these Ingredients well together, and sift them=
 through an open=20



HairSieve: and half a Tea spoonful, or less, of the Powder will relish any =
Sauce you have a mind=20

to make, though it be a quart or more, putting it into the Sauce, when it i=
s warm. To this, one may=20

add about nine Grains of sweet Basil, dry'd and powder'd; or of Summer swee=
t Marjoram=20

powder'd. If we use this Sauce for Fish, it is extremely good, adding only =
a little Anchovy Liquor=20

and white Wine.    To preserve _Grapes_ all the Winter.  Take an Earthen Ja=
r, well glaz'd, that will=20

hold about six Gallons, or more; then dry some Oats, a little, in the Sun, =
upon Leads if you can, so=20

that they have lost some part of their Moisture; lay them then two Inches t=
hick, at the bottom of the=20

Jar, and upon them, your Bunches of Grapes, gathered full ripe and dry; and=
 if in any Bunch there=20

is a rotted Grape, cut it off, and see that your Bunches are quite clean in=
 their Berries; and=20

besides, that all the Parts you have cut the Grapes from, are quite dry. La=
y these on the Oats, and=20

upon them put two Inches thick of Oats, dry'd as before; and on them again,=
 a Layer of Grapes,=20

and so the Oats upon them, continuing this Practice till the Vessel is full=
. Then take a Cork, well=20

soak'd in Oil, and stop it close in the Jar, and seal it up with Pitch, Bee=
s-Wax, and a little Rosin,=20

melted together, and keep it in a cool Place; but to bury it three Foot und=
er ground, is better.    A=20

Collar of _Mutton_ roasted. From _St. Edmund's-Bury_ in _Suffolk._  Take a =
Coast of Mutton,=20

which is the Neck and Breast together, skin it in the whole Piece; then par=
boil it, and prepare a=20

Mixture of Crumbs of Bread; Lemon-Peel grated, a little Pepper, Salt, Nutme=
g, or sweet Marjoram=20

powder'd, which answers the End of most Spices, or else a little dry'd swee=
t Basil, which we call=20

_Bush-Basil_, in the Gardens. To this, add the Yolks of six hard Eggs, beat=
 in a Mortar, with six=20

Ounces of Butter; mix this with the other Ingredients; then take the inside=
 of the Mutton, and cover=20

it with this Mixture, and roll it up as close as can be, and secure it in t=
he Roll; so that it may be=20

close for the Spit. It must be spitted through the Middle length-ways, and =
basted with Butter,=20

salting it every now and then, and the Gratings of Crusts of Bred should be=
 sprinkled upon it, with=20

the seasoning above. Just before it is enough, when it is taken off the Spi=
t, serve it with strong=20

Gravey and Lemon or Orange Juice, and garnish with Lemon or Orange sliced; =
or when Oysters=20

are in season, add fry'd Oysters: _viz._    To fry _Oysters_ for a Plate, o=

 we were paroled."=20

"As the years went by the popular feeling against us not only subsided, but=
 our absolute=20

obedience to the minutest detail of the prison discipline won us the consid=
eration, and I might even=20

say, the esteem of the prison officials. In the meantime it had been a life=
 sentence for Bob, he=20

having died of consumption September 16, 1889."  "Jim and I incrustated, or=
