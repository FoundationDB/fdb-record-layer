philodendron monstera   THE LEVERETT RANGE OF GRANITE.  This name is given =
to a granite range that emerges from the puddingstone near the centre of Am=
herst, and extends northerly, with some interruption, nearly thirty miles, =
through Leverett and Montague to philodendron monstera   THE LEVERETT RANGE=
 OF GRANITE.  This name is given to a granite range that emerges from the p=
uddingstone near the centre of Amherst, and extends northerly, with some in=
terruption, nearly thirty miles, through Leverett and Montague to _
wood slightly discolored but not dead. I did not thoroughly examine the fru=
it buds of the peach, but=20

suppose, of course, they are all killed. Had this intense cold weather occu=
rred early in December,=20

there is no doubt but the damage would have been immense.  There has been a=
 great loss of=20

potatoes in cellars and pits, as most people had worked themselves into the=
 belief that we were to=20

have a mild winter, and had not prepared their cellars to resist cold at th=
e rate of 30 degrees below=20

zero. The result is that thousands of bushels of potatoes are frozen and ru=
ined, and although the=20

largest crop of potatoes was raised last year that ever was raised in the U=
nited States, yet=20

potatoes will be high priced before planting time.      H. A. TERRY.       =
