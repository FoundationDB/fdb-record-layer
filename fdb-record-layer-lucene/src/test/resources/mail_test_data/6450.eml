by this blinding attack, he was forced to retire to his deep hole and wash =
it from his eyes. Six times=20

during the fight the valiant bull hippo quitted his watery fortress, and ch=
arged resolutely at his=20

pursuers; he had broken several of their lances in his jaws, other lances h=
ad been hurled, and,=20

falling upon the rocks, they were blunted, and would not penetrate. The fig=
ht had continued for=20

three hours, and the sun was about to set, accordingly the hunters begged m=
e to give him the=20

coup de grace, as they had hauled him close to the shore, and they feared h=
e would sever the=20

rope with his teeth. I waited for a good opportunity, when he boldly raised=
 his head from water=20

about three yards from the rifle, and a bullet from the little Fletcher bet=
ween the eyes closed the=20

last act. This spot was not far from the pyramidical hill beneath which I h=
ad fixed our camp, to=20

which I returned after an amusing day's sport.  The next morning, I started=
 to the mountains to=20

explore the limit that I had proposed for my expedition on the Settite. The=
 Arabs had informed me=20

that a river of some importance descended from the mountains, and joined th=
e main stream about=20

twelve miles from our camp. The aggageers were seriously expecting an attac=
k from the Base,=20

and they advised me not to remain much longer in this spot. The route was h=
ighly interesting:=20

about five miles to the Mravucsan.  Then added aloud:  "Where are you from,=
 sir?"  "From=20

Besztercebanya."  Mravucsan was even more surprised.  Fancy any one coming =
all the way from=20

Besztercebanya to Babaszek to buy an umbrella! How proud he was it had happ=
ened under his=20

mayorship! He nudged Galba:  "Do you hear?" he said.  "This is only a small=
 village shop, sir,"=20

answered Rosalia. "We don't keep umbrellas."  "Pity enough!" muttered Mravu=
csan, biting=20

savagely at his mustache.  "But I heard," went on the stranger, "that you h=
ad second-hand=20

umbrellas to sell."  Second-hand umbrellas! Well, what next!  Mravucsan, wh=
o was asthmatic,=20

began to breathe heavily, and was just going to say something disparaging t=
o the stranger, when=20

some runaway horses attracted his attention, as they rushed across the mark=
et-place, dragging a=20

handsome phaeton with them.  "That will never be fit for use again," said t=
he smith, as he stood=20

looking on, his hands folded under his leather apron.  The phaeton had prob=
ably been dashed=20

against a wall, for the left side was smashed to bits, the shaft was broken=
, one of the wheels had=20

been left somewhere on the road, and the reins were dragging on the ground =
between the two=20

horses.  "They are beautiful animals," said Galba.  "They belong to the pri=
est of Glogova,"=20

answered Mravucsan. "I'm afraid some one may have been thrown out of the ca=
rriage; let us go=20

and see."=20

country; to the east rose the peaked head of Allatakoora, about seven thous=
and feet from the=20

base, while S.S.E. was the lofty table-mountain, known by the Arabs as Boor=
kotan. We rode=20

through fertile valleys, all of which were free from grass, as the various =
fires had spread=20

throughout the country; at times we entered deep gorges between the hills, =
which were either=20

granite, quartz, or basalt, the latter predominating. In about three hours =
and a half we arrived at=20

Hor Mehetape, the stream that the Arabs had reported. Although a powerful t=
orrent during the=20

rains, it was insignificant as one of the tributaries to the Settite, as th=
e breadth did not exceed=20

twenty-five yards. At this season it was nearly dry, and at no time did it =
appear to exceed a depth=20

of ten or twelve feet. As we had arrived at this point, some distance above=
 the junction, we=20

continued along the margin of the stream for about two miles until we reach=
ed the Settite. The Hor=20

(a ravine) Mehetape was the limit of my exploration; it was merely a rapid =
mountain torrent, the=20

individual effect of which would be trifling; but we were now among the mou=
ntains whose drainage=20

caused the sudden rise of the Atbara river and the Nile. Far as the eye cou=
ld reach to the south=20

and east, the range extended in a confused mass of peaks of great altitude,=
 from the sharp granite=20

head of one thousand, to flat-topped basalt hills of five or six thousand f=
eet, and other conical=20

points far exceeding, and perhaps double, that altitude.  The Settite was v=
ery beautiful in this spot,=20

as it emerged from the gorge between the mountains, and it lay in a rough s=
tony valley about two=20

hundred feet below our path as we ascended from the junction of the Hor to =
better riding ground.=20

In many places, our route lay over broken stones, which sloped at an inclin=
ation of about thirty=20

degrees throughout the entire distance of the river below; these were forme=
d of decomposed=20

basalt rocks that had apparently been washed from decaying hills by the tor=
rents of the rainy=20

season. At other parts of the route, we  During this time the number of cus=
tomers in Mrs. Muencz's=20

shop had increased, and as they had to be attended to, she first turned to =
the stranger before=20

serving them, and said:  "There are a lot of old umbrellas somewhere on the=
 loft, but they would=20

not do for a fine gentleman like you."  "I should like to look at them all =
the same."  Mrs. Muencz=20

had her hand on the door to let her customers in, and only answered without=
 turning round:  "I can=20

assure you you would not take them in your hand."  But the young man was no=
t to be put off so=20

easily; he followed her into the shop, and waited till the customers were a=
ll served, then remarked=20

again that he would like to see the umbrellas.  "But, my good sir, don't bo=
ther me about the=20

umbrellas. I tell you they would be of no use to you. They are some that we=
re left from the time of=20

my poor husband; he knew how to mend umbrellas, and most of these are broke=
n and torn, and=20

they certainly will not have improved, lying on the dusty loft so long. Bes=
ides, I cannot show you=20

them, for my son is at the fair, the servant has a bad foot and cannot move=
, and when there is a=20

fair my shop is always full, so I cannot leave it to go with you."  The you=
ng lawyer took a five-florin=20

note out of his pocket.  "I don't want you to do it for nothing, Mrs. Muenc=
z, but I must see the=20

umbrellas at any price. So let me go up alone to the loft, and please take =
this in return for your=20

kindness."  Mrs. Muencz did not take the money, and her small black eyes ex=
amined the young=20

man suspiciously.  "Now I shall certainly not show you the umbrellas."  "An=
d why not?"  "My poor=20

dead husband used to say: 'Rosalia, never do anything you don't understand =
the reason of,' and=20

my husband was a very clever man."  "Of course, of course, you are quite ri=
ght, and can't=20

understand why I offer five florins for an old ragged umbrella."  "Just so;=
 for five florins you might=20

see something better."  "Well, it is very simple after all. My father had a=
 very old umbrella, to which=20



he was much attached, and I heard that it had come by chance=20


_
similar debris of basalt that lay at an angle of about sixty degrees, from =
a height of perhaps two=20

hundred feet to the water's edge, and reminded me of the rubbish shot from =
the side of a mountain=20

when boring a tunnel. The whole of the basalt in this portion of the countr=
y was a dark slate colour;=20

in some places it was almost black; upon breaking a great number of pieces =
I found small crystals=20

of olivine. Much of the into your husband's hands, and I should very much l=
ike to have it as a=20

souvenir."  "And who was your father, sir? Perhaps I may have heard of him.=

a little.  "Pal Gregorics," he said.  "Ah, Gregorics! Wait a bit! Yes, I re=
member, the funny little man=20

in whose will ..."  "Yes, yes. He left 2000 florins to nine ladies in Beszt=
