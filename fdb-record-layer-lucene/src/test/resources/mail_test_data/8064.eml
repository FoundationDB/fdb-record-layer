philodendron monstera set in order his plans for the newly struck-out futur=
e. In the later talk with Gantry he had learned many things about the polit=
ical situation in his native State, things which were enlightening if not p=
articularly encouraging. Trained in the ethics of a theoretical school, he =
knew only enough about practical politics to be very certain in his own min=
d that they were all wrong. And if Gantry's account could be trusted, there=
 were none but practical politics in the State where his father be on board=
 of the Maud during her present mission.  If the little steamer was not to =
engage in some perilous adventure, why should Scott wish he were somewhere =
else? But the captain was certainly solicitous for one of those whose safet=
y was threatened; and he tried to believe that this was a sufficient explan=
ation. While he was thinking of the matter, Morris rushed out of the cabin,=
 and looked and acted as though he were laboring under some excitement.  "W=
hat is the matter now, Morris?" philodendron monstera set in order his plan=
