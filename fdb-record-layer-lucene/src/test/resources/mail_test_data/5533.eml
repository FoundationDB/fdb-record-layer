was so entirely different from anything that Teeny-bits had experienced tha=

bewildered. The automobile was moving rapidly now, as he could tell by its =
tremulous motion and=20

its frequent lurches. No sound that would aid him in identifying his assail=
ants came to his ears,=20

however, and he could only helplessly await the next development. A cautiou=

muscles convinced him quickly that it was of no use whatever to strain agai=

Whoever these men were who had bound him in so strange a manner, they had d=

Teeny-bits knew instantly when it came to a stop, for the vibrations ceased=
. Only a moment=20

passed before he felt himself lifted by two pairs of hands and a moment lat=
er realized by the sound=20

and the motion that he was being carried up a long flight of steps. He hear=
d a door open and shut=20

and he sniffed a strange odor; food fracture is nearly even and earthy, it =
is soft, yielding readily to=20

unted, another door=20

He tried to speak, to ask where he was and what his captors intended, but o=
nly muffled mumblings=20

came from his lips. He heard the door close and knew that he was alone. A f=
eeling of despair, the=20

equal of which he had never experienced, swept over him; he was prismatic f=
orm. This wacke=20

fuses with difficulty before Brooke's blow-pipe. Specific gravity not deter=

 spotted red and=20

of sandstone are but a=20
