 a member of one of=20

the first colonization groups that went to the West coast of Africa followi=
ng the emancipation of the=20

slaves in this country.  The former slave was born at Dove City, South Caro=
lina, on Jan. 28, 1846,=20

of a half-breed Cherokee-and-Negro mother and Anglo-Saxon father. Her fathe=
r owned the=20

plantation adjoining that of her master.  When she reached the adolescent a=
ge Anna was placed=20

under the direct care of her mistress, by whom she was given direct charge =
of the dining-room and=20

entrusted with the keys to the provisions and supplies of the household.  A=

e commercial and=20

manufacturing cities of Italy, Germany, Flanders, become the cradles of fre=
e industry, and, at the=20

same time, of intellect, art, civilization. But these are points of light a=
midst the feudal darkness of=20

the rural districts. In France, for example, the peasantry are cattle; in t=
ime of peace crushed with=20

forced labour, feudal burdens, and imposts of all kinds; in time of war dri=
ven, in unwilling masses,=20

half-armed and helpless, to the shambles. Aristocratic luxury, gambling, pr=
ofligate wars--Jacques=20

Bonhomme pays for them all. At Crecy and Poictiers, the lords are taken pri=
soners; have to=20

provide heavy ransoms, which, being debts of honour, like gambling debts, a=

hing. Broad as it is, it=20

 lords are stupefied. At=20
