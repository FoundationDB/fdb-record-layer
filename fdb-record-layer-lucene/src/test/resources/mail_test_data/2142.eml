So we begged, an' we say, "Our missus is good. Don't you kill her. Don't yo=

istorians who=20

dwell on this fail to see that the real essence of religion, a belief in th=

righteousness, that belief which afterwards took the more definite form of =
Roman Stoicism, had=20

been detached by the dissolution of the mythologies, and exerted its force,=
 such as that force was,=20

independently of the ceremonial, the sacred chickens, and the dissipated hi=

sense the tribute paid by Polybius to the religious character of the Romans=
 is deserved; they had a=20

higher sense of religious obligation than the Greeks; they were more likely=
 than the Greeks, the=20

Phoenicians, or any of their other rivals, to swear and disappoint not, tho=
ugh it were to their own=20

hindrance; and this they owed, as we conceive, not to an effort of speculat=

early stage of society would be out of the question, but to some happy conj=
unction of=20

circumstances such as would be presented by a break-up of tribal mythologie=
s, combined with=20

influences favourable to the formation of strong habits of political and so=
cial duty. Religious art=20

morality was on the=20
