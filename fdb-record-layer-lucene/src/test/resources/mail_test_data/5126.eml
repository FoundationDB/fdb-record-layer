in a circle. He was trying to see some landmark, by which he could tell whether they had passed 

that spot before. He saw none.  "Nat," he said finally, "we're lost."     CHAPTER XIX  A PERILOUS 

SLIDE   For a few seconds after Jack's announcement Nat stared at his chum.  "Lost?" he 

repeated.  "That's what I said, Nat. Long Gun was right, and so was Tanker Ike. It's a heap sight 

easier to get lost in here than I thought. Why, every one of these peaks looks just like the one next 

to it. I don't believe we've been over the same bit of ground twice."  "I know how we can tell." 

"How?"  "Make a mark on one of these peaks, and then walk around and see if we get back to it." 

"That's a good way, but in which direction shall we go?"  Nat shrugged his shoulders.  "You've got 

me," he admitted. "But, say, didn't we come into this bad section from the east when we were after 

the deer?"  "Yes," said Jack after a attractive books for the sabbath, not letting the children have 

these during the week. By doing this, the children can be brought to look forward to the day with 

eagerness and pleasure.  PRIVATE OBSERVANCE.  Apart from public and family observance, 

the individual ought to devote a portion of the time to his own edification. Prayer, meditation, 

reading, ought not to be forgotten. Think of men devoting six days a week to their body, which will 

soon pass away, and begrudging one day to the soul which will live on and on forever: Is it too 

much for God to ask for one day to be devoted to the growth and training of the spiritual senses, 

when the other senses are kept busy the other six days?  If your circumstances permit, engage in 

some definite Christian work--such as teaching in Sunder school, or visiting the sick. Do all the 

good you can Sin keeps no sabbath, and no more should good deeds. There is

we were eating lunch I noted the sun. We sure did come in from the east. But what of that?" 

"Why, if we want to go back we must walk toward the east. That is, have the sun at our backs. 

Instead of that we've been walking with the sun in our faces most of the time. Let's try it."  "All 

right, but first let's make a mark on one of these peaks."  They did so by digging out a hollow with 

their hunting knives, and placing of mercy and religion. Make your sabbath down here a foretaste 

of the eternal sabbath that is in store for believers.  You want power in your Christian life, do you? 

You want Holy Ghost power? You want the dew of heaven on your brow? You want to see men 

convicted and converted? I don't believe we shall ever have genuine conversions until we get 

straight on this law of God.  SABBATH DESECRATION.  Men seem to think they

"What about the deer you shot?" asked Nat.  "We'll not try to get back to that. Make for camp is 

what I say. Long Gun will probably be able to find the deer."  It was getting quite late now, and the 

sun was barely visible from over the peaks of the bad lands. But turning their backs to it they 

started off. They did not know how far they went, but it was getting dusk rapidly, and _holiday_. 

The young have more temptations to break the sabbath than we had forty years ago. There are 

three great temptations: first, the trolley car, that will take you off into the country for a nickel to 

have a day of recreation; second, the bicycle, which is leading a good many Christian men to give 

up their sabbath and spend the day on excursions; and the third, the Sunday
