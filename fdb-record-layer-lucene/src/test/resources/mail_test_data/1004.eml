in the remotest and darkest corner of the recess, and there she remained be=
side him silent and=20

grave for a moment or two, and stole timid glances from time to time throug=
h the veil of her lashes=20

at the finely-chiselled, expressive face of her young English lover.  He wa=
s pining to put a question=20

to her, speakin', an' ye've stoppit him."  "An' what if I hev, Tuncan?  Can=
 he not continoo to speak=20

when I hev done?" retorted the old man, resuming his drum-stick.  "You are =
right, Mr McKay," said=20

the elder.  "But for the unfortunate jealousies of the two Companies, we mi=

his lips, would not=20

help him out, but a humorous twinkle in her dark eyes, and a faint smile ro=
und her lips lit up the=20

habitual seriousness of her young face.  "Mademoiselle ..." he managed to s=
tammer at last.=20

"Mademoiselle Yvonne ... you have seen Lady Blakeney?"  "Yes," she replied =
demurely, "I have=20

seen Lady Blakeney."  "And ... and ... she told you?"  "Yes. Lady Blakeney =
told me many things."=20

"She told you that ... that.... In God's name, Mademoiselle Yvonne," he add=
ed desperately, "do=20

help me out--it is cruel to tease me! Can't you see that I'm nearly crazy w=
ith anxiety?"  Then she=20

looked up at him, her dark eyes glowing and brilliant, her face shining wit=
h the light of a great=20

tenderness.  "Nay, milor," she said earnestly, "I had no wish to tease you.=
 But you will own 'tis a=20

grave and serious step which Lady Blakeney suggested that I should take. I =
have had no time to=20

think ... as yet."  "But there is no time for thinking, Mademoiselle Yvonne=
," he said naively. "If you=20

will consent.... Oh! you will consent, will you not?" he pleaded.  She made=
 establishment of a=20

colony in Red River would in no way hinder the fur-trade, we could all get =
along peaceably enough=20

together.  But it seems to have been ordained that man shall reach every go=
od thing through much=20

tribulation."  "I do not agree wi' you at all, Muster Sutherland," said old=
 McKay. "There iss many of=20

rich people in this world, who hev all that hert can wush, an' are born to =
it without hevin' any=20

treebulation at all."  "But I did not say `all that heart could wish,' Mr M=
cKay.  I said `_every_ good=20

thing'."  "Well, an' iss not wealth a goot thing, Muster Sutherland?"  "Onl=
y if God's blessing goes=20

along with it," returned the elder.  "If it does not, wealth is a curse."  =
"H'm!  I wush I had a little=20

more o' that curse--whatever," answered the irreverent old man.  "Besides,"=
 continued Sutherland,=20

not noticing the remark, "the rich are by no means exempt from tribulation.=
  They are sometimes=20

afflicted with bad children; not infrequently with bad health, which doctor=
s, at two or three guineas=20

a visit, cannot cure, and many of them are much troubled with poverty!"  "Y=
ou are talking in=20

the sofa stole nearer and then nearer to his; and with a quiver of exquisit=
e happiness his hand=20

closed upon hers. The tips of his fingers touched the smooth warm palm and =
poor Lord Tony had=20

to close his eyes for a moment as his sense of superlative ecstasy threaten=
ed to make him faint.=20

Slowly he lifted that soft white hand to his lips.  "Upon my word, Yvonne,"=
 he said with quiet=20

fervour, "you will never have cause to regret that you have trusted me."  "=
I know who, having=20

finished the drum-stick and its duplicate, was preparing his pipe for actio=
n.  "It is not much of a=20

riddle, Mr McKay.  I suppose you consider a man with ten thousand a year ri=
ch, and a man with=20

two hundred poor."  "Well, yes; I wull not be denyin' that."  "Well--if the=
 rich man spends ten=20

thousand and fifty pounds a year and never has anything to spare or to lay =
by, is he not miserably=20

poor--poor in spirit as well as in purse?  For, at the end of=20
