again instructed, and told to lay out as much money as he pleased in briefs=
 to counsel. I reckon=20

that he made a fine thing out of this bold modern smuggler. Four hundred po=

give time. Now, suppose that he gave Mr. Needy, the indefatigable junior co=
unsel, in all 25_l._=20

(which is far over the mark), and that Mr. Silkyarn, the eminent leader, go=

lines are erected in the rear of the first; and many large towns are comple=

defenses of their own.  Since the population of this region is nearly five =

than one hundred thousand people perished. In 1530, there was a general fai=
lure of the dykes,=20

and the people, not dreaming of danger, were suddenly overwhelmed; four hun=

perished, and the loss of property was proportionate. Two great floods have=
 occurred within this=20
