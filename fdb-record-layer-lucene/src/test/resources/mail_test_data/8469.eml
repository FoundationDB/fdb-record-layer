"I've been sleeping there nights," the man muttered.  "You're under arrest =
for stealing money from=20

the home of Sam Hatfield. Anything to say?"  "Not a thing," the tramp mutte=
red. Then he suddenly=20

changed his mind. "Yes, I have too!" he announced. "I know you'll take me t=
o jail, so I may as well=20

tell you the whole story. Not that you'll believe me!"  "Go ahead," the tro=

right, I stole the money," the tramp frankly admitted. "The first place I t=

Merrimac house."  "Then he was telling the truth when he said he'd lost a s=
trongbox!" Dan=20

exclaimed. "The other claimants were false."  "It was Merrimac's money," th=

"What's more, except for twenty-five dollars I used to live on, every cent =
of it is still here in the=20

box."  "How did the box get in the coal bin of the church?" Mr. Hatfield qu=
estioned.  "I'm coming to=20

that. But first I'd like to tell why I came to Webster City in the first pl=

only fair to warn you that anything you say may be used against you in cour=

hide," the tramp said with a shrug. "I've had a tough life, knockin' around=
 the world. Sometimes I've=20

had enough to eat--sometimes I haven't. For awhile I worked on a lake away =
to meet the coroner=20

at the Shimerdas', and Fuchs took off his coat and settled down to work. I =
sat on his work-table=20

and watched him. He did not touch his tools at first, but figured for a lon=
g while on a piece of=20

paper, and measured the planks and made marks on them. While he was thus en=
gaged, he=20

whistled softly to himself, or teasingly pulled at his half-ear. Grandmothe=

as not to disturb him. At last he folded his ruler and turned a cheerful fa=
ce to us.  "The hardest part=20

of my job's done," he announced. "It's the head end of it that comes hard w=
ith me, especially when=20

I'm out of practice. The last time I made one of these, Mrs. Burden," he co=

and tried his chisels, "was for a fellow in the Black Tiger mine, up above =
Silverton, Colorado. The=20

mouth of that mine goes right into the face of the cliff, and they used to =
put us in a bucket and run=20

us over on a trolley and shoot us into the shaft. The bucket traveled acros=

remembered I had an uncle here in Webster City that was well fixed. I'd nev=

you knock about like I've=20
