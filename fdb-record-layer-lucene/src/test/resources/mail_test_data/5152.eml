=9CMy opinion is, that his lordship should quit _
general idea of this miserable country:--  "July 3.--I went out early to ge=
t something for breakfast,=20

and shot a hare and seven pigeons. On my return to camp, an Arab immediatel=
y skinned the hare,=20

and pulling out the liver, lungs, and kidneys, he ate them raw and bloody. =
The Arabs invariably eat=20

the lungs, liver, kidneys, and the thorax of sheep, gazelles, &c. while the=
y are engaged in skinning=20

the beasts, after which they crack the leg bones between stones, and suck o=
ut the raw marrow."=20

A Bishareen Arab wears his hair in hundreds of minute plaits which hang dow=
n to his shoulders,=20

surmounted by a circular bushy topknot upon the crown, about the size of a =
large breakfast-cup,=20

from the base of which the plaits descend. When in full dress, the plaits a=
re carefully combed out=20

with an ivory skewer about eighteen inches in length; after this operation,=
 the head appears like a=20

huge black mop surmounted by a fellow mop of a small size. Through this mas=
s of hair he carries=20

his skewer, which is generally ornamented, and which answers the double pur=
pose of comb and=20

general scratcher.  The men have remarkably fine features, but the women ar=
e not generally=20

pretty. The Bishareen is the largest Arab tribe of Nubia. Like all the Arab=
s of Upper Egypt, they=20

pay taxes to the Viceroy; these are gathered by parties of soldiers, as a c=
ontinuance of miraculous=20

interpositions. He might have remained there for a day or days, and never h=
ave been recognized=20

when discovered. How marvelously providential that Father Coleman should ha=
ve been in the=20

vicinity, and tempted to visit the great ruin that very night!  Lord St. Je=
rome was devout, and easy=20

in his temper. Priests and women seemed to have no difficulty in managing h=
im. But he was an=20

English gentleman, and there was at the bottom of his character a fund of c=
ourage, firmness, and=20

commonsense, that sometimes startled and sometimes perplexed those who assu=
med that he=20

could be easily controlled. He was not satisfied with the condition of Loth=
air, =E2=80=9Ca peer of England=20

and my connection;=E2=80=9D and he had not unlimited confidence in those wh=
o had been hitherto=20

consulted as to his state. There was a celebrated English physician at that=
 time visiting Rome, and=20

Lord St. Jerome, notwithstanding the multiform resistance of Monsignors Cat=
esby, insisted he=20

should be called in to Lothair.  The English physician was one of those men=
 who abhor priests,=20

and do not particularly admire ladies. The latter, in revenge, denounced hi=
s manners as brutal,=20

though they always sent for him, and were always trying, though vainly, to =
pique him into=20

sympathy. He rarely spoke, but he listened to every one with entire=20


_
opportunity of visiting them during the drought, at which time they can be =
certainly found near the=20

river; but at any other season it would be as easy to collect tribute from =
the gazelles of the desert=20

as from the wandering Bishareens. The appearance of Turkish soldiers is any=
thing but agreeable=20

to the Arabs; therefore my escort of question, but he never made a remark. =
 Lord St. Jerome had=20

seen the physician alone before he visited the Palazzo Agostini, and had ta=
lked to him freely about=20

Lothair. The physician saw at once that Lord St. Jerome was truthful, and t=
hat, though his=20

intelligence might be limited, it was pure and direct. Appreciating Lord St=
. Jerome,=20


_
"cold shoulder" upon our arrival at an Arab camp, and no supplies were fort=
hcoming in the shape=20

of milk, &c. until the long coorbatch (hippopotamus whip) of Hadji Achmet h=
ad cracked several=20

times across the shoulders of the village headman. At first this appeared t=
o me extremely brutal,=20

but I was given to not ungenial, and assured his wife that she would meet o=
n the morrow by no=20

means so savage a being as she anticipated. She received him accordingly, a=
nd in the presence=20

of Monsignore Catesby. Never had she exercised her distinguished powers of =
social rhetoric with=20

more art and fervor, and never apparently had they=20


_
that I was utterly ignorant of the Arab character, and that he knew best. I=
 found by experience that=20

Hadji Achmet was correct; even where milk was abundant, the Arabs invariabl=
y declared that they=20

had not a drop, that the goats were dry, or had strayed away; and some palt=
ry excuses were=20

offered until the temper of the Turk became exhausted, and the coorbatch as=
sisted in the=20

argument. A magician's rod could not have produced a intended consequences.=
 The physician=20

said not a word, and merely bowed when exhausted Nature consigned the lumin=
ous and=20

impassioned Lady St. Jerome to inevitable silence. Monsignore Catesby felt =
he was bound in=20

honor to make some diversion in her favor; repeat some of her unanswered in=
quiries, and reiterate=20

some of her unnoticed views; but the only return he received was silence, w=
ithout a bow, and then=20

the physician remarked, =E2=80=9CI=20
