Fresh paint doesn't go well with the pattern of the kitchen linoleum!"  Dan took the hint and used 

the back porch for his work.  One morning while the dew was still heavy on the ground, he was 

painting a triangular banner to hang on the back of a ceremonial chair. Dan brushed on two red 

diamonds and then experimented with a few bright blue "X" marks sprinkled at random over the 

surface.  "Hard at work?" inquired a friendly voice.  Dan glanced up to see the milkman looking 

over his shoulder. He had not heard the wagon drive up.  "Sure," Dan grinned, moving aside so 

the man could reach the milk box at the doorstep. "I'm getting ready for the big Cub Scout 

knighting ceremony we're to have at the church."  "The Cubs really do a lot of interesting things," 

replied the milkman. He slipped two bottles into the box and gathered up the empties. "I read the 

other day how the Cubs found some grandmother to let me go with them: I would gladly go without 

my supper, I would sleep in the Shimerdas' barn and run home in the morning. My plan must have 

seemed very foolish to her, but she was often large-minded about humoring the desires of other 

people. She asked Peter to wait a moment, and when she came back from the kitchen she 

brought a bag of sandwiches and doughnuts for us.  Mr. Shimerda and Peter were on the front 

seat; Antonia and I sat in the straw behind and ate our lunch as we bumped along. After the sun 

sank, a cold wind sprang up and moaned over the prairie. If this turn in the weather had come 

sooner, I should not have got away. We burrowed down in the straw and curled up close together, 

watching the angry red die out of the west and the stars begin to shine in the clear, windy sky. 

Peter kept sighing and groaning. Tony whispered to me that he was afraid Pavel

turned up that tin box?"  "Guilty," agreed Dan. "I almost wish I hadn't found it too! So many 

persons have put in a claim. Then to make matters worse, the box disappeared again."  "I read 

about that too. Some neighbors of Mr. Hatfield told me the police gave him a pretty rough going 

over."  "They questioned him, the same as they did me," Dan replied never get well. We lay still 

and did not talk. Up there the stars grew magnificently bright. Though we had come from such 

different parts of the world, in both of us there was some dusky superstition that those shining 

groups have their influence upon what is and what is not to be. Perhaps Russian Peter, come from 

farther away than any of us, had

"But that's routine. He doesn't know what became of the money. Someone swiped it from his 

house."  "When was the box supposed to have disappeared?"  "No one knows. We took it there 

the night it was found in the church. Then the next morning when the police came, Mr. Hatfield 

couldn't find it."  "You know, I've been wondering if I should report this," the milkman said 

thoughtfully.  "Report land, too, some such belief.  The little house on the hillside was so much the 

color of the night that we could not see it as we came up the draw. The ruddy windows guided us--

the light from the kitchen stove, for there was no lamp burning.  We entered softly. The man in the 

wide bed seemed to be asleep. Tony and I sat down on the bench by the wall and leaned our 

arms on the table in front of
