tools in the awesome work of frightfulness which he carried on so ruthlessl=
y.  "Is that you Paul=20

Friche?" queried Martin-Roget in response.  "At your service, citizen," cam=
e the glib reply,=20

delivered not without mock deference.  "Then come up here. I wish to speak =
with you."  "I can't=20

leave my post, nor can my mates," retorted the man who had answered to the =
name of Paul=20

Friche. "Come down, citizen, an you desire to speak with us."  Martin-Roget=
 swore lustily.  "The=20

insolence of that rabble ..." he murmured.  "Hush! I'll go," interposed Cha=
uvelin quickly. "Do you=20

know that man Friche? Is he trustworthy?"  "Yes, I know him. As for being t=
rustworthy ..." added=20

Martin-Roget with a shrug of the shoulders. "He is a corporal in the Marats=
 and high in favour with=20

commandant Fleury."  Every second was of value, and Chauvelin was not the m=
an to waste time=20

in useless parleyings. He ran down the stairs at the foot of which one of t=
he red-capped gentry=20

deigned to speak with him.  "Have you seen any strangers across the Place j=
ust now?" he queried=20

in a whisper.  "Yes," replied the man Friche. "Two!"  Then he spat upon the=
 ground and added=20

spitefully: "Aristos, what? In fine clothes--like yourself, citizen...."  "=
Which way did they go?"=20

"Down the Ruelle des Jacobins."  "When?"  "Two minutes ago."  "Why did you =
not follow them?...=20

Aristos and...."  "I would have followed," retorted Paul Friche with studie=
d insolence; "'twas you=20

called me away from my duty."  "After them then!" urged Chauvelin peremptor=
ily. "They cannot=20

have gone far. They are English spies, and remember,  In the strength of hi=
s emotion he had=20

almost fired at a venture at the spot where the brute had disappeared; but =
luckily the=20

remembrance that it was his last charge of ammunition came to him in time, =
and he had the=20

resolution to restrain himself even when his finger was on the trigger.  Da=
n now perceived that he=20

must not venture to remain on the spot where he had passed the night, becau=
se, being=20

surrounded on three sides by shrubbery, it afforded his grisly foe an oppor=
tunity to approach from=20

any quarter, and spring on him the moment he should find him off his guard.=
  There was a natural=20

bank of earth out on the plain about three or four hundred yards off, with =
neither trees nor bushes=20

near it.  The bank was not more than four feet high, and the top slightly o=
verhung its base, so that=20

it afforded some slight protection from the sun.  To this spot Dan resolved=
 to betake himself, and=20

immediately began the journey--for a journey it surely was, seeing that the=
 hunter had to do it on=20

hands and knees, lifting his gun and pushing it before him, each yard or so=
, as he went along.=20

The inflammation of his wound rendered the process all the slower and more =
painful, and a=20

burning thirst, which he had no means of slaking, added to his misery.  By =
the time he had passed=20

over the short distance, he was so much exhausted that he fell at the foot =
of the bank almost in a=20

swoon.  Evidently the wolf imagined that its time had now come, for it snea=
ked out of the wood=20

when the hunter fell, and began cautiously to advance. But Dan saw this, an=
d, making a desperate=20

effort, arose=20


_
reward for their apprehension."  The man grunted an eager assent. The word =
"reward" had fired=20

his zeal. In a trice he had called to his mates and the three Marats soon s=
ped across the Place=20

and down the Ruelle des Jacobins where the surrounding gloom quickly swallo=
wed them up.=20

Chauvelin watched them till they were out of sight, then he rejoined his co=
lleague on the landing at=20

the top of the stairs. For a second or two longer the click of the men's sa=
bots upon the stones=20

resounded on the adjoining streets and across the Place, and suddenly that =
same quaint, merry,=20

somewhat inane laugh woke the echoes of the grim buildings around and cause=
d many a head to=20

turn inquiringly, marvelling who it could be that had the heart to laugh th=
ese days in the streets of=20

Nantes.   V  Five minutes or so later the three Marats could vaguely be see=
n recrossing the Place=20

and making their way back to Le Bouffay, where Martin-Roget and Chauvelin s=
till stood on the top=20

of the stairs excited and expectant. At sight of the men Chauvelin ran down=
 the steps to meet=20

them.  "Well?" he queried in an eager whisper.  "We never saw them," replie=
d Paul Friche gruffly,=20

"though we could hear them clearly enough, talking, laughing and walking ve=
ry rapidly toward the=20

quay. Then suddenly the earth or the river swallowed them up. We saw and he=
ard nothing more."=20

Chauvelin swore and a curious hissing sound escaped his thin lips.  "Don't =
be too disappointed,=20

citizen," added the man with a coarse laugh, "my mate picked this up at the=
 corner of the Ruelle,=20

when, I fancy, we were pressing the aristos pretty closely."  He held out a=
 small bundle of papers=20

tied together with a piece of red ribbon: the bundle had evidently rolled i=
n the mud, for the papers=20

were covered with grime. Chauvelin's thin, claw-like fingers had at once cl=
osed over them.  "You=20

must give me back those papers, citizen," said the man, "they are my booty.=
 I can only give them=20

up to citizen-captain Fleury."  "I'll give them to the citizen-captain myse=
lf," retorted posture, leaned=20

his back against the bank, and placed his gun across his knees.  Seeing thi=
s, the wolf sat down on=20

its haunches, and coolly began to bide its time.  "Ha! you brute!" muttered=
 Dan, "I could easily stop=20

your mischief if my strength wasn't all gone.  As it is, I dare not give yo=
u my last shot till you are so=20

close that you can look down the barrel o' my gun."  From this point a watc=
h of endurance began=20

on both sides--the brute, of course, unaware of the deadly weapon which its=
 intended victim held,=20

and the man fully aware of the fact that if he should venture to lie down a=
nd sleep, his doom would=20

be sealed.  It is impossible for any one who has not had trial of similar e=
xperiences to imagine the=20

rush of thought and feeling that passed through the brain and breast of Dan=
 Davidson during the=20

long dreary hours of that terrible day.  Sometimes he fell into a half-drea=
my condition, in which his=20

mind leaped over forests and ocean to bonnie Scotland, where his days of ch=
ildhood were spent in=20

glorious revelry on her sunny banks and braes.  At other times the memory o=
f school-days came=20

strong upon him, when play and lessons, and palmies were all the cares he h=
ad; or thoughts of=20

Sabbaths spent with his mother--now in the church, now in the fields, or at=
 the cottage door=20

learning Bible stories and hearing words of wisdom and the story of the cru=
cified One from her=20

lips.  Then the scene would change, and he was crossing the stormy ocean, o=
r fighting with Red-

skins, or thundering after the buffalo on the wide prairies.  But through a=
ll the varied fabric of his=20

thoughts there ran two distinct threads, one golden, the other black.  The =
first we need hardly say=20

was Elspie McKay; the second was that awful wolf which sat there glaring at=
 him with a hang-dog=20

expression, with the red tongue hanging out of its mouth, and from which he=
 never for a moment=20

allowed his eyes to wander.  As evening began to draw on, the situation bec=
ame terrible, for Dan=20

felt that the little strength he had left was fast=20


_
the moment you had best not leave your post of duty," he added more perempt=
orily, seeing that=20

the man made as he would follow him.  "I take orders from no one except ...=
" protested the man=20

gruffly.  "You will take them from me now," broke in Chauvelin with a sudde=
n assumption of=20

command and authority which sat with weird strangeness upon his thin shrunk=
en figure. "Go back=20

to your post at once, ere I lodge a complaint against you for neglect of du=
ty, with the citizen=20

proconsul."  He turned on his heel and, without paying further heed to the =
man and his mutterings,=20

he remounted the stone stairs.  "No success, I suppose?" queried Martin-Rog=
et.  "None," replied=20

Chauvelin curtly.  He had the packet of papers tightly clasped in his hand.=
 He was debating in his=20

mind whether he would speak of them to his colleague or not.  "What did Fri=
che say?" asked the=20

latter impatiently.  "Oh! very little. He and his mates caught sight of the=
 strangers and followed=20

them as far as the quays. But they were walking very fast and suddenly the =
Marats lost their trace=20

in the darkness. It seemed, according to Paul Friche, as if the earth or th=
e night had swallowed=20

them up."  "And was that all?"  "Yes. That was all."  "I wonder," added Mar=
tin-Roget with a light=20

laugh and a careless shrug of his wide shoulders, "I wonder if you and I, c=
itizen Chauvelin--and=20

Paul Friche too for that matter--have been the victims of our nerves."  "I =
wonder," assented=20

Chauvelin drily. And--quite quietly--he slipped the packet of papers in the=
 pocket of his coat.=20

"Then we may as well adjourn. There is nothing else you wish to say to me a=
bout that enigmatic=20

Scarlet Pimpernel of yours?"  "No--nothing."  "And you still would like to =
hear what the Kernogan=20

wench will say and see how she will look when I put my final proposal befor=
e her?"  "If you will=20

allow me."  "Then come," said Martin-Roget. "My sister's house is close by.=

APTER III  THE=20

FOWLERS   I  In order to reach the Carrefour de la Poissonnerie the two men=
 had to skirt the=20

whole edifice of Le Bouffay, walk a little along the quay and turn up the n=
arrow alley opposite the=20

bridge. They walked on in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts.  The =
house occupied by=20

the citizeness Adet lay back a little from the others in the street. It was=
 one of an irregular row of=20

mean, squalid, tumble-down houses, some of them little more than lean-to sh=
eds built into the=20

walls of Le Bouffay. Most of them had overhanging roofs which stretched out=
 like awnings more=20

than half way across the road, and even at midday shut out any little ray o=
f sunshine which might=20

have a tendency to peep into the street below.  In this year II of the Repu=
blic the Carrefour de la=20

Poissonnerie was unpaved, dark and evil-smelling. For two thirds of the yea=
r it was ankle-deep in=20

mud: the rest of the time the mud was baked into cakes and emitted clouds o=
f sticky dust under=20

the shuffling feet of the passers-by. At night it was dimly lighted by one =
or two broken-down=20

lanthorns which were hung on transverse chains overhead from house to house=
. These lanthorns=20

only made a very small circle of light immediately below which he had succe=
eded in rousing=20

himself in the earlier parts of the day were failing of their effect.  Then=
 a strange and sudden=20

change occurred, for, while he knew that the end of the trial was rapidly a=
pproaching, he began to=20

experience a feeling of indifference--the result, no doubt, of excessive we=
ariness--and almost a=20

wish that all was over.  Nevertheless, whenever that wolf moved, or changed=
 its position ever so=20

little, the instinct of self-preservation returned in full force, and Dan, =
pulling himself together,=20

prepared to defend himself desperately to the last gasp.  While the two wer=
e thus glaring at each=20

other, Dan was startled and thoroughly aroused from his irresistible lethar=
gy by a loud report.=20

Next moment he saw the wolf extended dead upon the plain.    CHAPTER TWENTY=
 FIVE.=20



ADVENTURES OF FERGUS AND HIS FRIENDS.  In order to account for the sudden d=
eath=20

recorded in the last chapter, we must turn aside to follow for a little the=
 fortunes of Fergus McKay.=20

It will be remembered that the vigorous Highlander, after overturning the I=
ndian canoe and running=20

his own canoe on shore, was seized by the neck, while in the act of reachin=
g forward to grasp his=20

gun, and captured.  Now, Fergus was of an unusually knowing and wily nature=
.  He possessed=20

what some would call more than his share of readiness in action and sagacit=
y in counsel, though=20

his ordinary reticence and sluggishness of manner concealed those qualities=
 to some extent.=20

Being endued, also, with more than the average allowance of that bodily str=
ength for which his=20

countrymen are famous, his first impulse was to exert his powers and show f=
ight, but he had been=20

taken suddenly at a disadvantage and thrown on his back into the bottom of =
the canoe, and at=20

least three pair of very muscular hands grasped his throat and other parts =
of his person.  That they=20

were strong hands he felt; that they belonged to big strong savages he had =
every reason to=20

believe--though it was too dark to see--and that scalping-knives and tomaha=
wks were handy to=20

them he knew to be highly probable.  He therefore promptly made up his mind=
 as to his course of=20

action, and at once began to play his part. Making a very feeble resistance=
--just enough, in short,=20

to deceive--he begged for mercy in soft, rather tremulous and very abject t=
ones.  True, his=20

language was English--at least that sort of English to which the mountainee=
rs of Scotland are=20

addicted--but he trusted to the tone and manner of his speech, not to the s=
ense, which Saulteaux,=20

he knew, could not be expected to understand.  "Oh! then, don't be hard on =
me.  Don't kill me,=20

goot shentlemen," he whined.  "It iss a poor worthless thing I am--whatever=
!"  These remarks, and=20

a few similar appeals for mercy, were accompanied with many dismal groans, =
as his captors were=20

dragging him up the bank of the stream.  Pausing for a moment, one of them =
produced a cord,=20

with which they proceeded to bind their cowardly and unresisting prisoner. =
 Whether the Indians=20

were deceived by their victim's tones and manner, and the soft condition of=
 his carefully relaxed=20

muscles, we cannot tell, but it seemed as if such were the case, for some o=
f the brief remarks=20

made by his captors had in them a smack of=20


_
save for the faint glimmer which filtrated through an occasional ill-fittin=
g doorway or through the=20

chinks of some insecurely fastened shutter.  The Carrefour de la Poissonner=
ie was practically=20

deserted in the daytime; only a few children--miserable little atoms of hum=
anity showing their=20

meagre, emaciated bodies through the scanty rags which failed to cover thei=
r nakedness--played=20

weird, mirthless games in the mud and filth of the street. But at night it =
became strangely peopled=20

with when the cord was being put round his arms he felt that the grip of hi=
s captors was slightly=20

relaxed.  Now or never was his chance!  Hurling the men on either side of h=
im right and left, he=20

delivered two random blows in front, one of which happily took effect on a =
savage chest, the other=20

on a savage nose, and cleared the way in that direction.  With a bound like=
 that of one of his own=20

mountain deer, he cleared the bank, and plunged into the river.  In ordinar=
y circumstances an=20
