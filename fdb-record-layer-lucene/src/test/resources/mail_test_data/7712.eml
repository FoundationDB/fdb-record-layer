her hair, thick with the night-dew sprent.     Soft kissed it, crying, "Lov=

ously they sped     By=20

broad lagoons where musky odors shed     New blooms. About them coiled long=
 wreaths of vine,=20

And slim lianas drooped, and marish lichens fine.     And fared they on o'e=
r many a slanting beach=20

And mountain crest; past many an open reach     And forest wild--till over =
Paradise     They saw=20

the stars, clear, tender, loving, rise.     Then 'neath the screen of those=
 rose-girdled walls     They=20

hid without, listing the waterfalls,     Or bird belated, twittering to its=
 nest.     So still the spot, the=20

very grass to rest     Seemed hushed.                    The garden-close, =
a clinging rose o'ercrept.=20

Its lustrous stem without that drooping swept     Thick set with buds as ti=

sunless hills, when wild the north wind blows.      Lilith a-tiptoe stood; =
upreaching, caught     The=20

swaying boughs. Her eyes with longing fraught     Close scanned her old des=
erted home. Then=20

came     Upon her spirit sadness, as if blame     Unuttered breathed throug=
h those remembered=20

glades     And touched the odors moist 'mong mirky shades.     With wistful=
 gaze, she traced each=20

bosky dell,     Each winding path. And sweet youth's memories fell     Abou=
t her.                Then=20

was she ware of Adam, slow     Pacing the pleasance-ways. With ruddy glow  =
   Fresh shone his=20

cheeks, and crisp his hair out-blown     By wanton winds. His lips were mir=
thful grown.     Once he=20

made pause hard by the coppice green     That hid the watcher. Once the lea=
fy screen     So near=20

he passed, from the overhanging edge     He brushed a rose. The hindering h=
edge     Quick=20

through, in sudden blessing slim white hand     Fain had she reached. "O Ed=
en mine! Dear land,"=20

She sighed. And springing warm the tender tide     Of teardrops gemmed the =
roses at her side.=20

So greets the weary wanderer once more     His early home. The lintels worn=
, the door     Age-

stained; the iris clumps, in sheltered nook;     The mill-wheel rotting o'e=
r the shrunken brook;=20

The sunny orchard, sloping west; and far     And cold, above his mother's g=
rave, a star--     Then=20

quick unbidden tears, the heart's warm rain,     O'erflow his soul, and lea=

Lilith backward turned to holier days,     Watching through misty tears whe=
re trod those ways=20

Her feet in other times.                              Sudden and sweet     =
Came down those paths a glimpse=20

of flying feet;     A sound of girlish laughter smote the air.     In jealo=
us rage, Lilith uprose to dare=20

The guarding Angel's wrath. But, silver clear,     The mocking laugh of Ebl=
is caught her ear.=20

"Thou hast forgot," he said, "this peaceful land,     Living, thou canst no=
t enter."                       the=20

mixing vessel previously well washed and rinsed with distilled water, and c=
autiously add Liquor=20

Ammoni=C3=A6. A grey precipitate will be formed; continue to add the ammoni=
a, drop by drop, till the=20

precipitate is just dissolved and the solution becomes clear. The solution =
should be well stirred=20

with a glass rod whilst adding the ammonia. Now add 4 oz. of solution No. 2=
, and re-dissolve the=20

brown precipitate which is produced with Liquor Ammoni=C3=A6 as before desc=
ribed. There will now be=20

about 6-1/2 oz. of solution. Subtract the 6-1/2 oz. from the total amount p=
reviously ascertained to=20

be required, and the remainder will be the amount of distilled water to be =
added. Add half this=20

quantity of distilled water to the 6-1/2 oz. of solution, and add a drop at=
 a time of solution No. 1, till=20

there is a slight precipitate, which cannot be re-dissolved by a considerab=
le amount of stirring (say=20

for 2 or 3 minutes); then add the remaining half of distilled water and cov=
er up from dust the vessel=20

containing the solution, so as to allow the slight precipitate to settle. T=
here is a point of importance=20

to be attended to, namely, that no more ammonia is employed than is absolut=
ely necessary. The=20

total amount of ammonia required in the 6-1/2 oz. of solution is about 2 dr=
s.         To Clean the=20

Mirror.  Fill the end of a test tube with cotton wool, leaving plenty outsi=
de the tube. Having poured=20



a small quantity of strong nitric acid on the front of the mirror, rub the =
acid well all over the front=20

and sides with the cotton wool brush. Place the speculum under a water tap =
for a few minutes till=20

the acid is washed away, and finally well rinse with distilled water; then =
place it in the silvering=20

vessel (previously thoroughly cleansed) and pour in distilled water till it=
 reaches 1/8 inch up the=20

side of the speculum.         To Mix the Solutions.  The precipitate having=
 settled, pour into a clean=20

vessel all that is clear of the solution, leaving about 2 oz. behind, which=
 will be turbid with the=20

precipitate, and therefore useless. The total amount will be afterwards mad=
e correct by the=20

addition of the same quantity of solution No. 3. Having filtered solution N=
o. 3, warm it to about=20

100=C2=B0 F. by allowing the bottle to stand in warm water, or by heating i=
n a small flask. When=20

everything is quite ready, add 2 oz. of the filtered solution No. 3, whilst=
 warm, to the clear solution=20

described above, and thoroughly mix.         To immerse the Mirror.  Remove=
 the mirror from the=20

distilled water, taking care not to touch the surface of the mirror, and wi=
pe the back and edge with=20

some clean cotton wool. If this precaution is not taken the water is liable=
 to drain down the sides of=20

the mirror whilst silvering, and cause streaks at the edge of the film. Hav=
ing poured away the=20

distilled water in the silvering vessel, substitute the mixed solutions, an=
d directly the solution=20

becomes slightly inky, gently immerse the mirror, taking care that no air b=
ubbles, or specks of any=20

kind, remain between the surface of the mirror and the solution. The mirror=
 should not be removed=20

from the bath until all the silver has been exhausted from the solution. Th=
is may be known by the=20

solution being clear below the silver film on the surface of the liquid. Th=
e time required will vary=20

from 45 minutes on a hot summer=E2=80=99s day, to 90 minutes when the therm=
ometer shows a low degree=20

of temperature. In the latter case it is better to have the silvering bath =
in a warm room.=20

Immediately the mirror is removed from the bath, the silvered surface shoul=
d be well washed by=20

allowing ordinary water to flow on it from a tap, for five minutes or more,=
 then finally rinse with=20

distilled water and place the mirror to dry with the silvered surface resti=
ng on some blotting paper.=20

It is as well if the mirror can be left undisturbed for a day or two, as th=
e film will be firmer, but it=20

may be polished, if desired, after drying for a few hours.         To Polis=
h the Silvered Surface.=20

Make a couple of polishing pads by filling two pieces of very soft wash-lea=
ther about six inches=20

square loosely with cotton wool, and tie them into balls. Gently remove any=
 dust that may have=20

settled on the film with some loose cotton wool, and then go over it with o=
ne of the pads in small=20

circular strokes for about 15 minutes. This will consolidate the film and f=
it it for polishing. Spread a=20

little of the finest rouge on a sheet of writing paper, and impregnate the =
other pad with it. Go over=20

the film with the rouged rubber with the same circular strokes till it is p=
erfectly polished, which will=20

take another 15 minutes or so. Never commence with the rouged pad, as the s=
urface may be=20

injured. When once the film has been consolidated it will remain so, and ca=
n be repolished many=20

times with the rouged pad should it get tarnished. The pads should be kept =
from dust in wide-

mouthed bottles for future use. With care the film will last for a long tim=
e, especially if it is not=20

allowed to get damp, and consequently the mirrors should never be brought u=
ncovered from the=20

cold air to a warmer temperature.  The =E2=80=9Cflat=E2=80=9D may be silver=
ed and polished in the same way as the=20

speculum, using a smaller appropriate vessel for the silvering solution.   =
      To Separate the=20

mirror from the Wooden Support.  Should the mirror be attached directly to =
its support, insert a=20

chisel between them, when one or two gentle blows will cause them to separa=
te, but, should the=20

mirror be cemented to a block, stand the mirror on edge, when a slight tap =
on the block will detach=20



it. Scrape off any pitch that remains on the back of the mirror, using fina=
lly some turpentine to wipe=20

it clean. Great care should be taken not to finger the film.         Martin=
=E2=80=99s process for Silvering.=20

Prepare four solutions of any quantity. Keep in stoppered bottles.  _Soluti=
on 1._=E2=80=94Dissolve 175=20

grains of pure nitrate of silver in 10 oz. of distilled water.  _Solution 2=

r 10 minutes, when cool=20

add 1 oz. of alcohol and then dilute with distilled water, so as to make up=
 the volume to 10 oz.  For=20

silvering use equal parts of each, mix solutions 1 and 2 together, and 3 an=
d 4; when the mirror is=20

ready mix the whole together in the silvering vessel and quickly suspend th=
e mirror.  In the=20

summer time, if the solution cannot be kept in a very cool place, the mirro=
r must be quite ready to=20

be placed in the bath, as the solutions turn instantly when mixed together.=

despair,     A sense of utter loss, downbending there,     With fingers hot=

 he said, "these earth-

     But wild eyes on=20

the babe she fixed. "Oh, blind,"     She cried, "was I. Yea, if the wanton =

not chide. Was it for this     I wandered far, and bartered Eden's bliss?  =
