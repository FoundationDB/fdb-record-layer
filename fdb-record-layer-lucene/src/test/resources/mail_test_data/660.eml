The house was, I may also explain, shut out from the view of travellers by a close wooden paling, a high gate, and a tall, dense, leafy hedge.  At this was in the way of salvage. The only remaining question was that of providing for the destitute. Appropriations from the State treasury were made, and corporations and private individuals contributed liberally.

metropolis into the most picturesque western suburb. My clue began with the vehicle at the north-

eastern corner of the Green Park, and ended just on the eastern entrance to the village of ----. It 

was a suspicious fact that this hack brougham was not driven by the same man throughout the 

entire distance. One driver was met about half way on the road, when he alighted from the box, 

and handed the whip to the person (always the same) who met him.  The brougham was one of 

those registered at Somerset House as a cab. It was a private vehicle, which appeared like the 

property of some indigent postmaster or jobber.  Where could this vehicle go to and come from? 

Among the difficulties in our case was that of tracing the goods. It was, I confess, not a little 

remarkable that no part of the goods could be traced. We had searched all the most notorious 

"fences." I do not think there was one known place in which goods of the  Suddenly there was a 

wild outcry and a hurried mustering of forces at the old Morganza levee. But men and materials 

were no longer of any use. The dull yellow flood poured through the gap like a mighty cataract. 

Four hundred feet of the embankment were gone in a few moments.  At once there was a _sauve 

qui peut_. The volunteer forces of the neighborhood hurried away to save what they could. As the 

Morganza levee was backed by a wide uninhabited swamp, there was little danger of any lives 

being lost by the sudden breach, though the people had clung to their homes to the last. 

Meanwhile, numerous other breaks were occasioned by the storm. The first occurred at Bayou 

Sara, and others followed so rapidly that within twenty-four hours fifteen huge crevasses were 

pouring their torrents upon the land. Two other breaks occurred in the Morganza; and so vast was 

the volume of water drawn out by the three that the river at

would be brought that we had not examined. Could this brougham be the means of conveying the 

plunder in small quantities to and from its place of concealment to the place or places of 

conversion into money? Those were questions we determined to solve.  A diligent watch was set 

at stages from the Green Park to ----.  Next evening the carriage did not present itself, nor the 

next; but on the third Sara, a few miles below, fell a foot in twenty-four hours, while the decline 

above was but an inch or two. Despite the gloomy outlook, the men toiled wearily on and finally 

succeeded in closing most of the breaks; but the great Morganza crevasses defied every effort. 

Then came breaks in the Atchafalaya, and the turbid waters united and swept southward one 

hundred miles to the sea. Some towns were

entire journey. I saw the driver changed.  I critically scanned the hirsute visage of the rider.  Just 

outside the village of ----, on the high road, there stood, and yet stands, a cottage residence, in not 

snakes and frogs; in others the people put false floors in their dwellings and prepared  [Illustration:

picking up the refugees and all accessible livestock. The effort to keep back the water was at an 

end, and all that could
