he was thinking hard. There was supposed to be no native intelligent life i=
n the legal sense on=20

Jontarou, and she had been careful to say nothing so far to make the Baluit=
 cats look like more=20

than rather exceptionally intelligent animals. The next--rather large--ques=
tion should be how she'd=20

come by such information.  If the Moderator asked her that, Telzey thought,=
 she could feel she'd=20

made a beginning at getting him to buy the whole story.  "Well," he said ab=
ruptly, "if the crest cats=20

are not extinct or threatened with extinction, the Life Banks obviously hav=
e no claim on your pet."=20

He smiled confidingly at her. "And that's the reason you're here, isn't it?=
"  "Well, no," Telzey began,=20

dismayed. "I--"  "Oh, it's quite all right, Miss Amberdon! I'll simply resc=
ind the permit which was=20

issued for the purpose. You need feel no further concern about that." He pa=
used. "Now, just one=20

question ... do you happen to know where your aunt is at present?"         =
*       *       *       *       *=20

Telzey had a dead, sinking feeling. So he hadn't believed a word she said. =
He'd been stalling her=20

along until the aircar could be found.  She took a deep breath. "You'd bett=
er listen to the rest of it."=20

"Why, is there more?" the Moderator asked politely.  "Yes. The important pa=
rt! The kind of=20

creatures they are, they wouldn't go into hiding indefinitely just because =
someone was after them."=20

Was there a flicker of something beyond watchfulness in his expression. "Wh=
at would they do,=20

Miss Amberdon?" he asked quietly.  "If they couldn't get at the men in the =
aircars and couldn't=20

communicate with them"--the flicker again!--"they'd start looking for the p=
lace the men came from,=20

wouldn't they? It might take them some years to work their way across the c=
ontinent and locate us=20

here in Port Nichay. But supposing they did it finally and a few thousand o=
f them are sitting around=20

in the parks down there right now? They could come up the side of these tow=
ers as easily as they=20

go up the side of a mountain. And supposing they'd moved forward at the sam=
e time with brilliant=20

grace, waving at the end the shawl.  The expression of her countenance, loo=
king round to Signor=20

Ricci, as she was moving on to see whether he had caught her idea, fascinat=
ed Lothair.  =E2=80=9CIt is=20

exactly what I told you,=E2=80=9D said Lord Carisbrooke, =E2=80=9Cand, I ca=
n assure you, it is the only dance now. I=20

am very glad I remembered it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI see it all,=E2=80=9D sai=
d Signor Ricci, as Theodora rapidly detailed to him=20

the rest of the figure. =E2=80=9CAnd at any rate it will be the Tangerine w=
ith variations.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CLet me have the=20

honor of being your partner in this great enterprise,=E2=80=9D said Lothair=
; =E2=80=9Cyou are the inspiration of=20

Muriel.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COh! I am very glad I can do any thing, however s=
light, to please you and your friends. I=20

like them all; but particularly Lady Corisande.=E2=80=9D  A new dance in a =
country-house is a festival of=20

frolic grace. The incomplete knowledge, and the imperfect execution, are th=
emselves causes of=20

merry excitement, in their contrast with the unimpassioned routine and almo=
st unconscious=20

practice of traditionary performances. And gay and frequent were the bursts=
 of laughter from the=20

bright and airy band who were proud to be the scholars of Theodora. The lea=
st successful among=20

them was perhaps Lord Carisbrooke.  =E2=80=9CPrincess Metternich must have =
taught you wrong,=20

Carisbrooke,=E2=80=9D said Hugo Bohun.  They ended with a waltz, Lothair da=
ncing with Miss Arundel. She=20

accepted his offer to take some tea on its conclusion. While they were stan=
ding at the table, a little=20

withdrawn from the others, and he holding a sugar-basin, she said in a low =
voice, looking on her=20

cup and not at him, =E2=80=9Cthe cardinal is vexed about the early celebrat=
ion; he says it should have been=20

at midnight.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am sorry he is vexed,=E2=80=9D said Lotha=
ir.  =E2=80=9CHe was going to speak to you himself,=E2=80=9D=20

continued Miss Arundel; =E2=80=9Cbut he felt a delicacy about it. He had th=
ought that your common feelings=20

respecting the Church might have induced you if not to consult, at least to=
 converse, with him on=20

the subject; I mean as your guardian.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt=20


_
problem was to clean out the human beings in Port Nichay?"  The Moderator s=
tared at her in=20

silence a few seconds. "You're saying," he observed then, "that they're rat=
ional beings--above the=20

Critical I.Q. level."  "Well," Telzey said, "legally they're rational. I ch=
ecked on that. About as rational=20

as we are, I suppose."  "Would you mind telling me now how you happen to kn=
ow this?"  "They=20

told me," Telzey said.  He was silent again, studying her face. "You mentio=
ned, Miss Amberdon,=20

that they have been unable to communicate with other human beings. This sug=
gests then that you=20

are a xenotelepath...."  "I am?" Telzey hadn't heard the term before. "If i=
t means that I can tell what=20

the cats are thinking, and they can tell what delicacy on these matters.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere ought to be none=20

on such matters,=E2=80=9D continued Miss Arundel, =E2=80=9Cwhen every thing=
 is at stake.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI do not see that I could=20

have taken any other course than I have done,=E2=80=9D said.Lothair. =E2=80=
=9CIt can hardly be wrong. The bishop=E2=80=99s=20

church views are sound.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CSound!=E2=80=9D said Miss Arunde=
l; =E2=80=9Cmoonshine instead of sunshine.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CMoonshine would rather suit a midnight than a morning celebration,=
=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cwould it not?=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CA fair repartee, but we are dealing with a question that cannot be=
 settled by jests. See,=E2=80=9D she said=20

with great seriousness, putting down her cup and taking again his offered a=
rm, =E2=80=9Cyou think you are=20

only complying with a form befitting your position and the occasion. You de=
ceive yourself.=20


_
I guess that's the word for it." She considered him, decided she had him al=
most on the ropes, went=20

on quickly.  "I looked up the laws, and told them they could conclude a tre=
aty with the Federation=20

which would establish them as an Affiliated Species ... and that would sett=
le everything the way=20

they would want it settled, without trouble. Some of them believed me. They=
 decided to wait until I=20

could talk to you. If it works out, fine! If it and they know it. That is w=
hy it was planned. It was not=20

necessary; nothing can be necessary so pregnant with evil. You might have m=
ade, you might yet=20

make, a thousand excuses. It is a rite which hardly suits the levity of the=
 hour, even with their=20

feelings; but, with your view of its real character, it is sacrilege. What =
is occurring tonight might=20

furnish you with scruples?=E2=80=9D And she looked up in his face.  =E2=80=
=9CI think you take an exaggerated=20
