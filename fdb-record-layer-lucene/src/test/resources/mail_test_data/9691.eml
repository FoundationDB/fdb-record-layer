Nearing the _Black Bee_, Jack signaled that he had a wounded man and was co=
ming aboard. He=20

got the all-clear at once.  The first person to reach the plane was Mary. S=
he had seen it all. There=20

was a look on her face that Jack had never seen there before as she called,=
 "Ted! Is he badly=20

injured?"  "He'll pull through," Jack admitted. "But why only Ted? Can't yo=
u give another fellow a=20

smile?"  "Jack, I could kiss you for saving Ted," she exclaimed. And that w=
as just what she did.  In=20

landing on the sea, and again on the deck of the _Black Bee_, Jack had expe=
rienced unusual=20

difficulty in controlling the jet plane, but was at the time too excited to=
 think much about it. When at=20

last he had time to look the plane over, he found that it had, at some time=
 during the fight, been=20

seriously damaged.  "You picked up some of our flak," was the verdict of th=
e commander of the=20

deck crews. "That plane's through."  When Jack came to his own commander to=
 ask for another=20

plane, the Commander put a hand on his shoulder and in a gruff voice said: =
 "Forget it, boy!=20

You've done your part. You've pitched five innings, and never a man got to =
first base. It's you for=20

the showers."  And so it was showers for Jack and Stew, and sick bay for Te=
d, with a smiling Mary=20

hovering over him. But the battle went on. Every carrier sent its full quot=
a of dive bombers and=20

torpedo planes to sink ships in the harbor and wreck shore installations. S=
peedy cruisers,=20

destroyers, and PT boats came in next to put on the finishing touches. Afte=
r these came troop=20

transports and landing barges. Marines and GI Joes swarmed ashore by the th=
ousands. By late=20

afternoon they were ten miles inland. The battle was won.  That was not all=
. They reached the=20

prison camp, knocked down the gates, and set free more than five hundred pr=
isoners who had not=20

looked on the Stars and Stripes for two long years.  Two hundred of the pri=
soners were put aboard=20

the _Black Bee_, for she would be the first ship to reach Pearl Harbor. The=
 hole in her side had=20

been shored up, making her safe for a journey, but not for combat.  As Jack=
 watched the=20

prisoners--ragged, unshaven, and lean-faced, with hungry looks in their eye=
s--line up on the deck,=20

he recalled a song he had sung back in school days:    Tramp! tramp! tramp!=
 the boys are=20

marching,   Cheer up, comrades, they will come,   And beneath the starry fl=
ag   We will breathe the=20

air again   Of the freeland in our own beloved home.  Others watched too. A=
ll of a sudden Mary let=20

out a cry: "Tom! Tom! Oh! My dear!" She threw her arms about a slim, bearde=
d youth who could=20

have been but a boy on Bataan.  "It's her brother," Jack whispered to Stew.=
 "She told me about=20

him. War is wonderful," he murmured. "Wonderful and terrible."  The _Black =
Bee_ held her=20

position for the night. Early next morning, while Jack was pacing the deck,=
 he saw a small craft=20

flying the Union Jack come alongside. A rope ladder was let down and two me=
n climbed aboard.=20

One of the two men glanced about the deck. When his eyes fell on Jack, he s=
aid:  "Ah! There you=20

are!" Staring, Jack made no reply. Then suddenly he recognized the men. The=
y were the British=20

pair he had first seen with the jet plane.  "We've come for our jet plane,"=
 the man explained,=20

advancing. "Those bloody Nazis and Japs stole her from us. We went after th=
em with a boatload=20

of fighting men, only to find that they were all dead and that you had gone=
 off with our plane. But=20

now here we are. Thanks for saving our plane, old boy! That was bully!"  "O=
h! Gee!" Jack=20

exclaimed. "Somebody's always taking the joy out of life! I suppose there's=
 no way I can talk you=20

out of it?"  "Not a chance," was the smiling answer. "You see, this jet pla=
ne idea was all worked=20

out in England. Then the United States asked for a chance to develop it. Th=
ey were given the right=20

and manufactured a few of them for experimental purposes. Australia asked f=
or one of these and=20

got it. My partner and I were given the task of testing the plane. We were =
traders before the war=20



and so had a few caches of kerosene and other trade goods scattered among t=
he islands."=20

"That's why you were on our island," said Jack.  "Exactly why. But those Ge=
rmans surprised us=20

while we were on another island, and hijacked our plane. Now I'm afraid we'=
ll have to ask to have=20

it returned. However, we've brought you a consolation award."  "What's that=
?" Jack stared.=20

"Twenty sacks of first-class mail for the men on your carrier. There should=
 be a letter or two for=20

you in that lot."  "Oh, a dozen, I hope!" Jack exclaimed. "We haven't had a=
ny mail for a month."  It=20

turned out that there were fifteen letters for Jack. The one he prized most=
 came from Patsy. In part=20

it ran:    Oh, Jack! Do take care of yourself and come back soon. It's only=
 since   you've been gone=20

that I've learned how much you mean to my young life.   You're the only boy=
 I ever really cared for,=20

and the only one I ever   shall.  "Boy!" Jack exclaimed. "That fixes things=
 just about hunkydory!=20

'Take good care of yourself.' That's just what I've been doing. 'Come back =
soon.' Wouldn't I love it!=20

Even just for a day!"  Did a good gremlin whisper, "Sooner than you think"?=
 If he did, he spoke the=20

truth. neck adjacent to the mark of the ligature.  The marks of very differ=
ent constricting ligatures=20

may be quite similar. Taylor[750] mentions a case in which a soft silk hand=
kerchief was used, and=20

the appearance was the same as that of a narrow cord, due to the tightness =
with which it was tied.=20

Where a hard substance like a piece of coal or stone is inserted into the l=
igature, usually then a=20

soft cloth, and presses directly against some part of the neck, there is us=
ually a corresponding=20

bruise.  Marks of pressure by the thumb and fingers are usually on the fron=
t of the neck, and either=20

just above or below the larynx. In many cases these marks are only those of=
 the finger-tips with=20

some scratches. These marks may show definitely the probable size of the as=
saulting hand, and=20

whether right or left.  Marks of strangulation may disappear rapidly after =
the removal of the=20

ligature. Assailants usually constrict the neck much more violently than is=
 sufficient to cause death.=20

Marks of violence on the neck are, therefore, greater in strangulation than=
 in hanging.  A great=20

variety of external injuries other than those on the neck have been found i=
n the different cases=20

reported where other forms of violence were used. With few exceptions such =
additional injuries=20

indicate homicide.  =3DExternal Appearances Due to Asphyxia.=3D=E2=80=94A f=
ew of these have already been=20

given under the caption =E2=80=9CSymptoms.=E2=80=9D If death occurs quickly=
 there may not be any signs of=20

asphyxia. The general LIVIDITY which comes on in the second stage usually r=
emains after death.=20

The face varies in color from violet to black and may be swollen. Casper[75=
1] says that the face=20

has the appearance of any other corpse. Liman[752] found the face livid in =
only one of fourteen=20

cases. Hofmann[753] says that the cyanosis appears during the agony because=
 of paralysis of the=20

circulation and gravitation of blood. The cyanosis of the face, projection =
of the eyes, and=20

congestion of the conjunctiv=C3=A6 are due to the expiratory effort. These =
signs are also seen in fat=20

persons who do not die of strangulation. Tardieu[754] mentions a dotted red=
ness or minute=20

ecchymosis of the conjunctiv=C3=A6 and skin of face, neck, and chest as con=
stant; but this cannot be=20

considered characteristic, because it has been seen, though not so well mar=
ked, in death from=20

other causes. It has been found in suffocation from compression of the ches=
t and belly; and also=20

where there is respiratory interference in the prolonged efforts of tedious=
 labor and in convulsions.=20

Liman[755] found it in those who were hung. It is due, according to Hofmann=
,[756] to increased=20

blood pressure and consequent hemorrhages. It is of importance as tending t=
o show that there=20

was stasis of blood in the head and face during life. Liman[757] found cyan=
osis in the conjunctiv=C3=A6,=20

lips, back of mouth, and in the muscles. Maschka[758] in 234 cases of asphy=
xia found capillary=20



hemorrhages of the eyes and eyelids 87 times.  Dastre and Morat[759] claim =
that in asphyxia the=20

cutaneous circulation becomes more active than in the normal state, while a=
t the same time the=20

vessels of the abdominal cavity are contracted. Laffont[760] considers the =
mechanism of this=20

peripheral dilatation.  POST-MORTEM STAININGS (hypostases) are usually dark=
er in=20

strangulation than in other forms of death. They appear soon, as does also =
putrefaction, because=20

of the quantity and fluidity of the blood.  Signs of HEMORRHAGE from the no=
se, eyes, and mouth=20

may be visible; as also bloody froth from the mouth and nose. Chevers[761] =
never saw bleeding=20

from the ears in strangulation. Taylor[762] states that Dr. Geoghegan infor=
med him of a case of=20

suicidal strangulation by a ribbon; the violence was great, there was bleed=
ing from the ear, and the=20

drum was found ruptured. In this case the mark on the neck, which was deep,=
 nearly disappeared=20

after the ligature was removed. Taylor also says Wilde, of Dublin, saw a ca=
se of rupture of drum=20

and hemorrhage in strangulation. Pellier[763] says that Littr=C3=A9 mention=
s a case of rupture of=20

tympanic membrane in strangulation by a cord. Zoufal and Hofmann have offer=
ed explanations of=20

the occurrence (Case 35).  The FACE usually shows pain and suffering; altho=
ugh sometimes the=20

features are calm. In the latter case there may have been syncope.  The EYE=
S are usually staring,=20

prominent, and congested, and the pupils dilated. Casper[764] doubts their =
prominence. Budin=20

and Coyne[765] state that in asphyxia the dilation of the pupil progresses =
to a maximum and then=20

convulsions occur. Ophthalmoscopic examination during the dyspn=C5=93a of a=
sphyxia shows a=20

lessened fulness of the retinal vessels.  The TONGUE is often swollen, dark=
, protruding, and=20

sometimes bitten. Maschka[766] states that if the ligature lies above the h=
yoid bone, the tongue=20

will be drawn backward; if over or below the bone, the tip of the tongue ma=
y appear more or less=20

between the jaws.  The HANDS are usually clinched and may have in their gra=
sp articles which,=20

under the circumstances, have a medico-legal value.  The EXTERNAL GENERATIV=
E ORGANS=20

are sometimes congested; erection of the penis may have taken place and per=
sisted. The vagina=20

may be moist. Tardieu, Devergie, and Casper[767] deny that=20

Harbor for three days. Ted, who was practically himself again, and Mary, wh=
o was enjoying a new=20

lease on life, had been making good use of the Hawaiian moonlight. One morn=
ing Jack and Stew=20

were taking in the sights, when Jack was called back to the ship by his com=
mander.  "Get your=20

things together," the Commander ordered. "You're going back to the States b=
y plane."  "What's=20

that, sir?" Jack stared. "What have I done now?"  "Plenty!" The Commander s=
miled. "It happens=20

you're the only living man who has flown a jet plane in actual combat! Sinc=
e our people are soon=20

to put this new type of plane into production--"  "They want my expert advi=
ce, sir?" Jack laughed.=20

"Why not, sir? It will be a real pleasure!"  "You leave by plane in three h=
ours, so you'd better start=20

packing. Good-by and good luck." The Commander extended his hand. "The _Bla=
ck Bee_ will be=20

shipshape about thirty days from now. We shall hope to have you back by the=
n. And if you can talk=20

them out of about ten of those jet planes for our carrier, I'll recommend y=
our promotion to a=20

Lieutenant's rank."  "Then I'm as good as a Lieutenant right now, sir!"  Ja=
ck's arm went up in a=20

snappy salute and, executing a right-about-face, he went off to pack; thoug=
h he hated the thought=20

of leaving the _Black Bee_ and all the splendid men aboard, he could not st=
ill the song in his heart=20

as he visioned the excitement of his next adventure.                       =

HARGES of urine,=20

f=C3=A6ces, and seminal fluid may have occurred. There is nothing character=
istic in their appearance.=20

All the external appearances of asphyxia are usually more marked in strangu=
lation than in=20

hanging.  =3DInternal Appearances.=3D=E2=80=94THE MARK. Usually there is he=
morrhage into the loose=20

connective tissue under the mark and in the subjacent muscles; in most case=
s isolated and=20

circumscribed, but sometimes extending beyond the line of the mark. Hemorrh=
age from=20



compression by the fingers is more marked than that from ligature.[768] Som=
etimes there is only=20

fulness of the subcutaneous veins.  The CAROTID ARTERIES may suffer rupture=
 of their inner=20

and middle coats, especially in atheromatous subjects and when the compress=
ion has been great.=20

Friedberg[769] states that the injury of the carotid, if there is hemorrhag=
e into its middle and=20

internal coats, is a proof that the strangulation occurred during life, and=
 probably from pressure of=20

the fingers on the neck, without any regard to any disease of the artery. H=
e reports two cases. The=20

examiner should be careful not to injure the artery with his forceps. The v=
essels may contain clots.=20

The NECK occasionally suffers extreme injury, and, owing to the violence us=
ed, this occurs=20

oftener in strangulation than in hanging.[770] Occasionally the neck is bro=
ken.  The HYOID bone=20

may be fractured (see Case 5). Maschka[771] saw one case in eighteen of Erd=
rosselung and five=20

cases in fifteen of Erw=C3=BCrgen.  The TRACHEA is sometimes torn, or may b=
e folded on itself.  The=20

cartilages of the LARYNX, especially if calcareous, may be fractured. This =
is more likely to affect=20

the thyroid than cricoid. The fracture would appear to occur only as the re=
sult of enormous force;=20

especially in the young in whom the cartilages are so elastic. The experime=
nts of Keiller[772] on=20

cadavers led him to conclude that falls on the larynx, even from a height a=
nd with superadded=20

force, are unlikely to fracture that organ; that severe pressure or violent=
 blows against the larynx=20

from before backward may cause fracture; but that severe lateral pressure, =
as in ordinary=20

throttling, is more likely than other forms of violence to fracture the al=
=C3=A6 of the thyroid or even the=20

cricoid cartilages and also the hyoid bone. Taylor[773] states that Dr. Inm=
an, of Liverpool, had=20

informed him of a case of splitting of rings of windpipe from pressure (see=
 Cases 5, 13).=20

Maschka[774] in fifteen cases of choking found six fractures of the larynx.=
  Chailloux[775] has=20

collected eight cases of fracture of larynx in strangulation. They were all=
 made with the fingers.=20

=80=94The VEINS of the entire body=20

are distended with very dark and very fluid blood, while the arteries, espe=
cially in the young, are=20

mostly empty. Experiments on the lower animals have shown that the pulmonar=
y artery and=20

systemic veins to the finest ramifications are distended with dark blood.[7=
77]  THE HEART.=E2=80=94The=20

right side, especially the auricle, is usually full of dark fluid blood, du=
e to the mechanical=20

impediment to the passage of blood through the lungs. If the heart continue=
s to beat after the=20

respiration has ceased the right ventricle is commonly well contracted, lik=
e the left cavities, and=20

nearly empty, the lungs being much congested. Sometimes the left cavities o=
f the heart contain=20

blood. This would be most likely to occur if the heart should stop in the d=
iastole. Sometimes clots=20

are found in the right ventricle. Maschka[778] found clots in the heart 25 =
times in 234 cases of=20

asphyxia.  The LUNGS are usually much congested, resembling red hepatizatio=
n, except that the=20

blood is darker. Hemorrhages (apoplexies) into the substance of the lungs a=
re common. Tardieu=20

found patches of emphysema due to rupture of the surface air-vesicles, givi=
ng the surface of the=20

lung the appearance of a layer of white false membrane. Ogston admits this =
occurrence in pure=20

strangulation but to a less extent in mixed cases. Liman[779] found the lun=
g surface uneven,=20

bosselated, the prominences being of a clearer color and due to emphysema. =
The lungs were in=20

the same condition of congestion and emphysema in strangulation, suffocatio=
n, and hanging. He=20

failed to find the apoplexies described.  The lungs are sometimes an=C3=A6m=
ic. In healthy young=20

subjects, especially children, the blood-vessels of the lungs often empty t=
hemselves after the heart=20



stops. The lungs may, therefore, be bloodless, but emphysematous from the v=
iolent efforts to=20

breathe. Page=E2=80=99s experiments on the lower animals showed the lungs o=
f a pale reddish color and=20

not much distended; a few dilated air-cells might be seen toward their ante=
rior borders, and there=20

might be small hemorrhages over the surface. His experiments appear to show=
 that subpleural=20

ecchymoses occur as a result of violent and repeated efforts to breathe. Am=
ong other=20

experiments[780] he stopped the mouth and nostrils of a young calf long eno=
ugh to excite violent=20

efforts at respiration; it was then instantly killed by pithing. The lungs =
were found pale red, not=20

congested, but showed subpleural ecchymoses. Page believed these were due t=
o the changed=20

relation between the capacity of the thorax and volume of lungs. Liman foun=
d these ecchymoses=20

in cases of strangulation, hanging, drowning, poisoning, hemorrhage, and =
=C5=93dema of brain, in the=20

new-born, etc. He failed to find them in some cases of suffocation. He beli=
eves them due to blood=20

pressure from stasis in the blood-vessels. Ssabinski[781] made many experim=
ents on dogs and=20

cats to ascertain the presence or absence of subpleural ecchymoses in stran=
gulation, drowning,=20

ary tracts, and=20

pleur=C3=A6, pericardium, peritoneum, membranes of brain, and the ependyma.=
 These are sometimes=20

minute and stellate, at others irregular in shape; many are bright-colored.=
 According to Tardieu the=20

punctiform ecchymoses are rarely present except in suffocation. Maschka,[78=
2] in 234 cases of=20

asphyxia, found the lungs congested 135 times, an=C3=A6mic 10, and =C5=93de=
matous 42. He thinks the=20

subpleural ecchymoses valuable signs of asphyxia.  The BRONCHIAL TUBES are =
usually full of=20

frothy, bloody mucus, and the mucous membrane is much congested and shows a=
bundant=20

ecchymoses.  The lining membrane of the LARYNX and TRACHEA is always conges=
ted and may=20

be livid; the tube may contain bloody froth or blood alone.  Tidy comparing=
 strangulation and=20

hanging concludes that because strangulation is usually homicidal, and grea=
ter violence is used,=20

therefore the external marks are more complete in strangulation and the con=
gestion of the air=20

passages is invariably much greater.  Maschka found the PHARYNX cyanotic in=
 216 of 234 cases=20

of asphyxia.  The other MUCOUS MEMBRANES are generally much congested. Seru=
m is found=20

in the serous cavities.  Maschka[783] considers the rounded, pin-head ecchy=
moses of the inner=20

surface of the _scalp_ and pericranium valuable evidence of asphyxia.  The =
BRAIN and=20

Langreuter[786] made some experiments on a cadaver from which  enough of th=

 each other. Similar=20
