The Foards are as alike as buttons in looks, but the younger one is so infinitely nicer than the other."  Tuesday, Wednesday, and for gadflies and other insects. Like many birds of these desert places, they fear so little the approach of man, that children often catch them in their hands. In the valleys of Aragua, where they are very common, we _
revolved like a kaleidoscope. Lorna sometimes found herself escorted by Stewart or Angus, 

sometimes by Charlie or Michael Foard, the friends who were staying with them, and oftener still 

by Vincent Beverley, whose fair hair, blue eyes, and merry face--so like Irene's--specially attracted 

her. She was so unaccustomed to have a cavalier at all that it seemed wonderful to her that any 

one should take the trouble to carry her basket, pick flowers that grew out of her reach, help her 

up difficult steps or hand her into a rocking boat. This new aspect of the world was very sweet. 

Insensibly it affected her.  "Lorna's growing so pretty," commented Peachy to Irene. "She's a queer 

girl. At school she goes about looking almost plain and as dreary as an owl. She's found torpid 

with cold. They were subject to a winter-sleep, like the European frog, lizard, sand-martin, and 

marmot. If the hibernal lethargy be observed, both in cold-blooded and in hot-blooded animals, we 

shall be less surprised to learn, that these two classes furnish alike examples of a summer-sleep. 

In the same manner as the crocodiles of South America, the tanrecs, or Madagascar hedgehogs, 

in the midst of the torrid zone, pass three months of the year in lethargy.  On the 25th of March we 

traversed the smoothest part of the steppes of Caracas, the Mesa de Pavones. It is entirely 

destitute of the corypha and moriche palm-trees. As far as the eye can reach, not a single object 

fifteen inches high can be discovered. The air was clear, and the sky of a

two sides of her wouldn't believe the difference. When she's animated she's nearly beautiful."  "I 

don't think she's ever been really appreciated at the Villa Camellia," replied Irene. "Mums likes her 

immensely. She says there's so much in her, and that she only wants 'mothering' to bring her out. 

As for Vin, his head's turned. He's made me vow faithfully to engineer that he sits next to Lorna in 

the boat to-day. Are you going with Stewart? Well, I've promised yellowish light, caused no doubt 

by the quantity of sand suspended in the atmosphere. We met some large herds of cattle, and with 

them flocks of birds of a black colour with an olive shade. They are of the genus Crotophaga,* and 

follow the cattle. (* The Spanish colonists call the Crotophaga ani, zamurito (little carrion vulture--

Vultur aura minuta), or garapatero, the eater of garaparas, insects of the Acarus family.) We had 

often seen them perched on the backs of
