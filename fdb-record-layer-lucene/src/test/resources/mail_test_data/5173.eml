Yet true love would be won by virtue, not violence.  _Sansthanaka._ But, ma=

l tragedy of the=20

Pleiade checked the development of this species. The very name "Morality" d=
isappears from the=20

theatre after 1550.  The _sottie_, like the Morality, was a creation of the=
 fifteenth century. Whether=20

it had its origin in a laicising of the irreverent celebration of the Feast=
 of Fools, or in that parade of=20

fools which sometimes preceded a Mystery, it was essentially a farce, but a=
 farce in which the=20

performers, arrayed in motley, and wearing the long-eared cap, distributed =
between them the=20

fants sans Souci_,=20

known in other cities by other names, presented the unwisdom or madness of =
the world in parody.=20
