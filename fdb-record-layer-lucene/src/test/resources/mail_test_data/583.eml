time you turn around, I bet someone tells you what you have to do."  "That isn't so," Dan denied. 

"Mr. Hatfield is our leader. Brad is the Den Chief, and I'm the Denner. Naturally, we make 

suggestions sometimes that the other fellows carry out. But we aren't bossy about it."  "Cubs 

nevertheless are required to obey orders and follow the rules," Mr. Hatfield said quietly. "Society is 

built upon regulations. Otherwise one would have chaos."  "When one person defies or disregards 

rules, it means hardship for someone else," added Burton Holloway, driving home the point.  "To 

heck with the rules!" laughed Jack. "That's my motto."  "I fear such an attitude may bring you to 

serious trouble one of these days," Mr. Holloway remarked with concern. "Better get on the beam, 

my boy."  "Say, I don't like these sweetness and light lectures," Jack said, his suspicions reviving. 

"Why'd you pick me up anyhow? You ain't a plainclothes detective?"  "No, Jack."  "You know my 

name!"  "Yes, Jack, we do. You're a runaway from the Child Study Institute."  Mr. Holloway now 

felt fairly safe in revealing his knowledge, for the station wagon approached the Institute.  As he 

pulled the strange, uprooted people among the first settlers, those two men were the strangest 

and the most aloof. Their last names were unpronounceable, so they were called Pavel and Peter. 

They went about making signs to people, and until the Shimerdas came they had no friends. 

Krajiek could understand them a little, but he had cheated them in a trade, so they avoided him. 

Pavel, the tall one, was said to be an anarchist; since he had no means of imparting his opinions, 

probably his wild gesticulations and his generally excited and rebellious manner gave rise to this 

supposition. He must once have been a very strong man, but now his great frame, with big, knotty 

joints, had a wasted look, and the skin was drawn tight over his high cheek-bones. His breathing 

was hoarse, and he always had a cough.  Peter, his companion, was a very different sort of fellow; 

short, bow-legged, and as fat as butter. He always seemed pleased when he met people on the 

road, smiled and took off his cap to every one, men as well as women. At a distance, on his 

wagon, he looked like an old man; his hair and beard were of such a pale flaxen color that they 

seemed white in the sun. They were

recognized the familiar structure.  "You tricked me!" he shouted furiously.  His elbow gouging Dan, 

he tried to push open the car door.  "Let me out of here!" he cried.  "No, Jack!" Mr. Hatfield said, 

holding him firmly by the arm. "You ran away and you must be returned here. I'm sorry."  Jack 

fought like a wildcat for a minute or two, but found himself quite helpless in the grip of the two 

men.  "What'll you gain?" he demanded bitterly. "I'll run away again! I'll run away a thousand times! 

snub nose, set in this fleece, was like a melon among its leaves. He was usually called "Curly 

Peter," or "Rooshian Peter."  The two Russians made good farmhands, and in summer they 

worked out together. I had heard our neighbors laughing when they told how Peter always had to 

go home at night to milk his cow. Other bachelor homesteaders used canned milk, to save trouble. 

Sometimes Peter came to church at the sod schoolhouse. It was there I first saw him, sitting on a 

low bench by the door,
