discussion must end. "We're not accusing anyone. A Cub's word is good enoug=
h for me."=20

"Remember that face at the window?" Dan reminded the group. "Someone saw us=
 looking at the=20

money. Maybe that's how the story got out!"  "It's very possible, Dan," agr=
eed Mr. Hatfield.=20

"Anyway, it's a relief to know that the Cubs all kept their promises. If Mr=
. Wilson can establish his=20

claim, he's welcome to the money."  "He must have been dizzy to hide the bo=
x in a coal bin," Brad=20

said, getting up from the davenport. "It doesn't make sense to me."  Mr. Ha=
tfield told the Cubs that=20

he considered it most important that no one reveal the exact amount of cash=
 that had been found.=20

"Brad, Dan, Fred and myself are the only ones who know the correct total," =
he said. "But the rest=20

of you have a pretty fair idea. The thing is--keep it to yourselves. If the=
 amount should become=20

known, well, it might make it easier for Mr. Wilson to prove a claim."  "Yo=
u can depend on us, Mr.=20

Hatfield," Brad said, speaking for the others. "How about you, Babe?"  "Oh,=
 sure," the youngest=20

member of the Den returned carelessly. "I forget now how much it was we cou=
nted at the church."=20

"Midge isn't here, but I'll stop at his house and warn him," Dan offered.  =
The matter of the cash box=20

having been thoroughly discussed, Mr. Hatfield told the boys his real purpo=
se in calling them was=20

to remind them to start working on the church building fund pledge cards.  =
"Call on your prospects=20

as soon as you can," he advised. "Today if possible. We want to get that mo=
ney rolling in."  "What=20

about our plans for the Crusade?" Brad reminded him.  "You'll hear more abo=
ut that at our next=20

meeting," Mr. Hatfield promised. "Meanwhile, dig up anything you can for co=
stumes."  "I have an=20

idea--" Dan began.  What it was no one learned, for just then the front doo=
rbell rang.  "That must=20

be Midge," Brad said. "Or maybe the police."  But it was neither.  Instead,=
 when Mr. Hatfield went=20

to the door he found Edgar Brakschmidt standing there, hat in hand.  The Cu=
b leader knew the=20

man only slightly, having seen him occasionally at church services.  "I beg=
 your pardon--you're Mr.=20

Hatfield," the visitor asked.  "Yes, I am." The Cub leader moved aside so t=
hat the man might enter.=20

"Come on in. We're having a Cub meeting."  "Oh, I don't want to break it up=
," the visitor=20

apologized. "Nevertheless, the matter I came to talk about happens to conce=
rn the Cubs." Mr.=20

Brakschmidt laughed self-consciously.  "They haven't been in any mischief, =
I trust."  "Oh, no!=20

Nothing like that. May I speak with you in private, Mr. Hatfield?"  "We can=
 go into the study if you=20

like. However, if the matter concerns the Cubs, why not tell them about it =
also?"  "Well--all right, I=20

may as well come right out with it. I lost some money recently--a rather la=
rge sum. Information has=20

come to me that this money contained in a metal box, was found at the churc=
h by one of the=20

Cubs."  The boys were listening intently, amazed expressions mirrored on th=
eir faces. First Mr.=20

Wilson, and now a second claimant!  "How much did you lose, Mr. Brakschmidt=
?" the Cub leader=20

asked.  "I can't rightly say. For months I had been saving it. The amount w=
as considerable."  "And=20

where was this money lost, Mr. Brakschmidt?"  "Why, in the church. I--I wen=
t in there a few days=20

ago--day before yesterday to be exact--to see the pastor. I was taking the =
money with me to=20

deposit in the bank. The minister wasn't there. I must have put the box dow=
n and forgot it,=20

because I didn't discover my loss until later."  "Really, Mr. Brakschmidt, =
I never knew you to be so=20

careless with money," remarked the Cub leader. "Where did you think you lef=
t the box?"  "In one of=20

the seats," the visitor replied after a slight hesitation.  "That wasn't wh=
ere we found the box!" Chips=20

exclaimed. "Dan found it--"  Brad gave him a kick in the ankle, a warning n=
ot to tell everything he=20

knew.  "May I ask how you learned that the Cubs had come upon a box of mone=
y?" Mr. Hatfield=20

inquired.  "Why, the news is everywhere."  Brad was disgusted. So were the =
other Cubs, who=20



couldn't imagine how the word had spread.  "Babe, 'fess up," Red whispered =
in the younger boy's=20

ear. "Did you spill it?"  "I did not," he retorted indignantly. "Cross my h=
eart and hope to die!"=20

"Midge wouldn't tell," Red said. "All the other Cubs have given their word.=
 It's mighty funny--"  Mr.=20

Hatfield was speaking again. "Since the news is everywhere as you say, Mr. =
Brakschmidt, I may=20

as well admit that the Cubs did find a little money. We expect to turn it o=
ver to police. If you have=20

any claim, you'll have to take it up with them."  "You still have the money=
 here in the house?"=20

"Yes," the Cub leader admitted reluctantly.  "Then why put me to the troubl=
e of having to go=20

through the police and perhaps the courts to prove my claim? The money is m=
ine. If you return it=20

to me, I'll give the Cubs a suitable reward, a very generous one in fact." =
 Mr. Hatfield had begun to=20

lose patience.  "I am sorry, Mr. Brakschmidt," he said. "You'll have to tak=
e the matter up with=20

police."  Mr. Brakschmidt argued for a while longer. Then, convinced that h=
e was making no=20

headway, he rather warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain typ=
es of damages. If any=20

disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of th=

"That's the limit!" Fred sputtered. "Two claimants for the money. What did =
