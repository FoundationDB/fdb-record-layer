been brought back from the far land of that sad story by one of the sea-rov=
ers of Kisington, who=20

had first told the tale.  Here also was one of the partly-grated nuts with =
which Meg had flavored the=20

first King's Pie; and a precious pearl from Gerda's Wonder-Garden, the gift=
 of the grateful=20

Mermaid. There, worn to rags, by the passage of many years, was the origina=

Claribel, from the model of the Lion Passant. And this the Red King liked b=
est of all. But there=20

were many interesting things in the Museum of King Victor which recalled to=
 Red Rex the stories=20

that Harold had read to him.  One day King Victor and a merry party rode to=
 the town of=20

Derrydown in the north. Here was the great lion-doll factory, started by Cl=
aribel and the Lion=20

Passant, which had made their fortune and that of Derrydown. The party stop=

things I find fault with in=20

arguments are exhausted.  Those of my readers who have taken an interest in=
 her ladyship's=20

speculations and in my endeavours to extricate her from her pecuniary embar=
rassments, may=20

conceive our feelings upon hearing of the surrender of General Lee. I regre=

every device which the experience of Spiffy, of Lady Broadhem's lawyer, and=
 of Lady B. herself=20

could suggest, her liabilities have increased to such an extent in conseque=
nce of the rapid fall of=20

Confederate stock, that I was obliged to take advantage of the Easter reces=
s to run over to Ireland=20

to make arrangements for selling an extremely encumbered estate which I pur=

 its resemblance to his=20

family crest. And because it was his family crest also, Red Rex made the la=

 was the very same tiny=20

hut in which Claribel had lived; and over the fireplace still showed dimly =
the carved coat of arms=20

and the motto, _Noblesse oblige_.  When Red Rex saw this, he stood and star=

sperous condition of=20

the peasants of Connemara after the accounts I had received of them. When I=
 "surveyed" my own=20

estate, which consists of seven miles of uninterrupted rock, I regarded wit=

population who could find the means of subsistence upon it, and whose rags =
were frequently of a=20

very superior quality. I also felt how creditable it was to the British Gov=
ernment,=20
