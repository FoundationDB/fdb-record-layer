relief of the sick and suffering, should be required for continuance in its=
 practice, but for the=20

earnestness with which the plaintiff in error insists that, by being compel=
led to obtain the certificate=20

required, and prevented from continuing in his practice without it, he is d=
eprived of his right and=20

estate in his profession without due process of law. We perceive nothing in=
 the statute which=20

indicates an intention of the legislature to deprive one of any of his righ=
ts. No one has a right to=20

practise medicine without having the necessary qualifications of learning a=
nd skill; and the statute=20

only requires that whoever assumes, by offering to the community his servic=
