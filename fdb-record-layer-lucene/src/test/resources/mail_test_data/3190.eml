dracaena marginata haunts of men. First he had cruised in the 'Folly, and then camped and shot in Canada; and again, as winter drew on apace, had chartered another yacht, a larger one, and sailed away for the West Indies, quarrelled like that, though not in the exact words I heard then; and twice, some time ago, when I did interfere, I was sent away, and told not to mix myself up with family quarrels.'

"Where you are concerned, Honora, I have but one desire," he answered, "and that is to see you 

happy--in the best sense of the term. If I could induce you to go back and give your husband 

another trial, I should return with a lighter heart. You ask me whether I think you have been selfish. 

I answer frankly that I think you have. I don't pretend to say your husband has not been selfish 

also. Neither of you have ever tried, apparently, to make your marriage a success. It can't be done 

without an honest effort. You have abandoned the most serious and sacred enterprise in the world 

as lightly as though it had been a piece of embroidery. All that I can gather from your remarks is 

that you have left your husband because you have grown tired of him."  "Yes," said Honora, "and 

you can never realize how tired, unless you knew him as I did. When love dies, it turns into hate." 

He rose, and walked to the other end of the room, and turned.  "Could you be induced," he said, 

"for the sake of your aunt and uncle, if not for your own, to consider a legal separation?"  For an 

instant she stared at him hopelessly, and then she buried her face in her hands.  "No," she cried. 

"No, I couldn't. You don't know what you ask."  He went to her, and laid his hand lightly on her 

shoulder.  "I think I do," he said.  There was a moment's tense silence, and then she got to her 

feet and looked at him proudly.  "Yes," she cried, "it is true. And I am not ashamed of it. I have 

discovered what love is, and what life is, and I am going to take them while I can."  She saw the 

blood slowly leave his face, and his hands tighten. It was not until then that she guessed at the 

depth of his wound, and knew that it was unhealed. For him had been reserved this supreme 

irony, that he should come here to plead for her husband and learn from her own lips that she 

loved another man. She was suddenly filled with awe, though he turned away from her that she 

might not see his face: And she sought in vain for words. She touched his hand, fearfully, and now 

it was he who trembled.  "Peter," she exclaimed, "why do you bother with me? I--I am what I am. I 

can't help it. I was made so. I cannot tell you that I am sorry for what I have done--for what I am 

going to do. I will not lie to you--and you forced me to speak. I know that you don't understand, 

and that I caused you pain, and that I shall cause--them pain. It may be selfishness--I don't know. 

God alone knows. Whatever it is, it is stronger than I. It is what I am. Though I were to be thrown 

into eternal fire I would not renounce it."  She looked at him again, and her breath caught. While 

she had been speaking, he had changed. There was a fire in his eyes she had never seen before, 

in all the years she had known him.  "Honora," he said quietly, "the man who has done this is a 

scoundrel."  She stared at him, doubting her senses, her pupils wide with terror.  "How dare you, 

Peter! How dare you!" she cried.  "I dare to speak the truth," he said, and crossed the room to 

where his hat was lying and picked it up. She watched him as in a trance. Then he came back to 

her.  "Some day, perhaps, you will forgive me for saying that, Honora. I hope that day will come, 

although I shall never regret having said it. I have caused you pain. Sometimes, it seems, pain is 

unavoidable. I hope you will remember that, with the exception of your aunt and uncle, you have 

no better friend than I. Nothing can alter that friendship, wherever you go, whatever you do. 

Goodby."  He caught her hand, held it for a moment in his own, and the door had closed before 

she realized that he had gone. For a few moments she stood motionless where he had left her, 

and then she went slowly up the stairs to her own room . . . .     CHAPTER X  THE PRICE OF 

FREEDOM  Had he, Hugh Chiltern, been anathematized from all the high pulpits of the world, 

Honora's belief in him could not have been shaken. Ivanhoe and the Knights of the Round Table 

to the contrary, there is no chivalry so exalted as that of a woman who loves, no courage higher, 



no endurance greater. Her knowledge is complete; and hers the supreme faith that is unmoved by 

calumny and unbelief. She alone knows. The old Chiltern did not belong to her: hers was the new 

man sprung undefiled from the sacred fire of their love; and in that fire she, too, had been born 

again. Peter--even Peter had no power to share such a faith, though what he had said of Chiltern 

had wounded her--wounded her because Peter, of all others, should misjudge and condemn him. 

Sometimes she drew consolation from the thought that Peter had never seen him. But she knew 

he could not understand him, or her, or what they had passed through: that kind of understanding 

comes alone through experience.  In the long days that followed she thought much about Peter, 

and failed to comprehend her feelings towards him. She told herself that she ought to hate him for 

what he had so cruelly said, and at business. My son, however, anticipated the message, and 

alighted from the train just as I sent off the message. He met me in the village, and we walked to 

Parksides together. When I went to my master and told him that my son had arrived, he expressed 

himself as being very pleased. Between my master and my son the most friendly and cordial 

relations existed; they never had a word of difference. This made my own service in the house 

very pleasant, so far as my master was concerned. I was present during some portion of the time 

my son was with our master, who spoke in great praise of the way my son was conducting the 

London business. They had tea together in my master's room, and after that my son left for 

London.'  "'At what hour did he leave?'--'At about seven o'clock. I did not take particular note of the 

time, there being no occasion for it, but that was about the hour, within a few minutes one way or 

another. At eight o'clock my master rang the bell for me, and I went up to him. I was in the habit of 

sitting with him often when there was no one else in the house, and sometimes of reading the 

paper to him. He was very lonely, and very much troubled and unhappy about his daughter.'  "Mr. 

Cornwall (rising): 'I submit, sir, that these observations do not come within the scope of the 

present inquiry.'  "The Coroner: 'I think the witness is giving her evidence fairly. It will, however, be 

as well that she should confine herself as much as possible to facts.'  "Witness: 'I am stating facts, 

sir.'  "The Coroner: 'I mean facts relating to the death of the deceased. It is sufficient, perhaps, at 

present to know that there was some disturbance of those affectionate relations which should exist 

between father and daughter.' To witness: 'Under what circumstances did Miss Farebrother, on 

the last occasion, leave her father's house? I must request you not to interrupt the proceedings, 

Mr. Cornwall. You are here only upon courtesy.'  "Mr. Cornwall: I might contest that, sir; but I will 

interrupt as little as possible.'  "The Coroner (to witness): 'Answer my question.'--'I do not know the 

precise circumstances, sir. All I know is that they had a violent quarrel late at night, and that Miss 

Farebrother left against her father's wish, and without his consent. After her departure he was very 

unhappy, and shed tears.'  "The Coroner: 'Proceed now with the events of the day you are 

describing.'--'I sat with my master till ten o'clock, and then there was a ring at the gate bell. My 

master said it was a visitor he was expecting, and I went down and admitted him. I do not know his 

name, but for the last three or four years he came perhaps four or five times a year--always at 

night--and he and my master would be closeted together for two or three hours. On this occasion 

that he was with my master I went down to the kitchen, and did my work there. I put everything in 

order, and saw that the things were in their right places. Among other things, the knives, which I 

kept in the dresser drawer.'  "'Have you any reason for particularly mentioning the knives?'--'Yes, 

sir. Among them was a large knife with a horn handle, which I had recently sharpened. My work 



being finished, I went up to my bedroom, stopping on my way outside my master's door, and 

asking him whether he wanted anything. He answered no, and that I was to get to bed. It was his 

usual answer, and I obeyed him; there was nothing to excite my suspicions. At a little after eleven I 

was in bed and asleep. I slept for over two hours, and then I awoke. Sounds in the lower part of 

the house had roused me. I listened, and heard some one moving about. Lighting a candle, I 

looked at my watch. It was twenty minutes past one. I was not easy in my mind, and I went down-

stairs. I listened a moment at my master's door, but all was still in the room. There was a light 

there, however, and I knocked softly. I got no answer, and I gently tried the handle; the door was 

unlocked, and I took a step into the room. There was no one there but my master, and he was 

asleep in his chair. He sometimes slept so for a few hours; he suffered greatly from gout and 

rheumatism, and he has said to me that he felt easier in that position than in bed. I closed the door 

quietly and went down to the kitchen, and there, to my astonishment, I saw Miss Farebrother. She 

had a knife in her hand, the knife with a horn handle, and she put it hastily on the table as I 

entered. The drawer in which I kept my knives was open; when I went to bed I left it closed. Miss 

Farebrother was very angry at my making my appearance, and she asked me how I dared to play 

the spy upon her. I told her that I was not playing the spy, and that I had been disturbed in my 

sleep by a noise in the house, and I came down to see what it was. I said something, too, about 

how astonishing it was that she should come home at such an hour, and she replied that it was no 

business of mine, and that I was to go to my 


_
resentment was akin to hatred: again, his face rose before her as she had seen it when he had left 

her, and she was swept by an incomprehensible wave of tenderness and reverence. And yet--

paradox of paradoxes --Chiltern possessed her!  On the days when his letters came it was as his 

emissary that the sun shone to give her light in darkness, and she went about the house with a 

song on her lips. They were filled, these letters, with an elixir of which she drank thirstily to behold 

visions, and the weariness of her exile fell away. The elixir of High Purpose. Never was love on 

such a plane! He lifting her,--no marvel in this; and she--by a magic power of levitation at which 

she never ceased to wonder--sustaining him. By her aid he would make something of himself 

which would be worthy of her. At last he had the incentive to enable him to take his place in the 

world. He pictured their future life at Grenoble until her heart was strained with yearning for it to 

begin. Here would be duty,--let him who would gainsay it, duty and would have me bundled out of 

the house the first thing in the morning. It was no use answering her; she was my mistress, and I 

had to obey her; so I went up to my room again. I can't exactly say how long it was afterward, but 

it could not have been very long--perhaps half an hour or three-quarters, bringing the time to past 

two o'clock--that I heard the voices of my master and his daughter outside the house. Whether she 

had gone up to him and woke him, or whether he had gone out, as he sometimes did in the middle 

of the night, I don't know, but at the time I heard them they were in the grounds. They both 

seemed to be very angry. Miss Farebrother, as well as I could make out, was insisting that her 

father should give her a sum of money, and she was using threats toward him. Presently he spoke 

in a more gentle tone to her, and I heard him say, "Wait till I am dead and it will all be yours, if you 

will come back and behave as a dutiful and affectionate daughter to me." And I heard her answer: 

"I will do as I please and go

man's labour, she at a woman's; labour not for themselves alone, but for others. A paradise such 

as never was heard of--a God-fearing paradise, and the reward of courage.  He told her he could 

not go to Grenoble now and begin the life without her. Until that blessed time he would remain a 

wanderer, been dead long ago! You had better be careful!" After that the voices grew fainter and 

fainter, as if they were moving away.'  "The Coroner: 'Hearing what you did, why did you not go 

down to them?'--'I did not like to; and, to tell the truth, it would have been as much as my situation 

was worth to
