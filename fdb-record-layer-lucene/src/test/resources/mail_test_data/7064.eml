over full, to the Loire with them!--a hundred or two at a time! Pestilence,=

wield pick or shovel long.  He was too excited for that.  He changed from o=
ne thing to another _
justice sit in Nantes town; let the whole nation know how traitors are deal=
t with: let the nation see=20

that her rulers are both wise and just. Let wolves and wolflings be brought=
 up for trial, and set up=20

the guillotine on Place du Bouffay with four executioners appointed to do h=
er work. There would be=20

too much work for two, or even three. Let there be four--and let the work o=
f extermination be=20

complete.  And Carrier--with powers as of a proconsul--arrives in Nantes to=
wn and sets to work to=20

organise his household. Civil and military--with pomp and circumstance--for=
 the son of a small=20

farmer, destined originally for the Church and for obscurity is now virtual=
 autocrat in one of the=20

great cities of France. He has power of life and death over thousands of ci=
tizens--under the=20

direction of justice, of course! So now he has citizens of the bedchamber, =
and citizens of the=20

household, he has a guard of honour and a company of citizens of the guard.=
 And above all he=20

has a crowd of spies around him--servants of the Committee of Public Safety=
 so they are called--

they style themselves "La Compagnie Marat" in honour of the great patriot w=
ho was foully=20

murdered by a female wolfling.  So la Compagnie Marat is formed--they wear =
red bonnets on their=20

heads--no stockings on their feet--short breeches to display their bare shi=
ns: their captain, Fleury,=20

has access at all times to the person of the proconsul, to make report on t=
he raids which his=20

company effect at all hours of the day or night. Their powers are supreme t=
oo. In and out of=20

houses--however private--up and down the streets--through shops, taverns an=
d warehouses,=20

along the quays and the yards--everywhere they go. Everywhere they have the=
 right to go! to=20

ferret and to spy, to listen, to search, to interrogate--the red-capped Com=
pany is paid for what it=20

can find. Piece-work, what? Work for the guillotine!  And they it is who ke=
ep the guillotine busy.=20

Too busy in fact. And the court of justice sitting in the Hotel du Departem=
ent is overworked too.=20

Carrier gets impatient. Why waste the time of patriots by so much paraphern=
alia of justice?=20

Wolves and wolflings can be exterminated so much more quickly, more easily =
than that. It only=20

needs a stroke of genius, one stroke, and Carrier has it.  He invents the _=
Noyades_!  The=20

Drownages we may call them!  They are so simple! An old flat-bottomed barge=
. The work of two or=20

three ship's carpenters! Portholes below the water-line and made to open at=
 a given moment. All=20

so very, very simple. Then a journey downstream as far as Belle Isle or la =
Marechale, and=20

"sentence of deportation" executed without any trouble on a whole crowd of =
traitors--"vertical=20

deportation" Carrier calls it facetiously and is mightily proud of his inve=
ntion and of his witticism=20

too.  The first attempt was highly successful. Ninety priests, and not one =
escaped. Think of the=20

work it would have entailed on the guillotine--and on the friends of Carrie=
r who sit in justice in the=20

Hotel du Departement! Ninety you know, as I have said before.  But have it =
your own way, Tan.  If=20

my little lass is willin', old Tuncan McKay won't stand in your way."  That=
 night the inhabitants of=20

Red River lay down to sleep in comfort and to dream, perchance, of the comi=
ng, though long=20

delayed, prosperity that had hitherto so often eluded their grasp.  Next da=
y an event occurred=20

which gave the poor settlers new cause for grief amounting almost to despai=
r.  Dan Davidson and=20

Elspie were walking on the verandah in front of Ben Nevis at the time.  It =
was a warm sunny=20

afternoon.  All around looked the picture of peace and prosperity.  "Does i=
t not seem, Dan, as if all=20

the troubles we have gone through were a dark dream--as if there never had =
been any reality in=20

them?" said Elspie.  "It does indeed seem so," responded Dan, "and I hope a=
nd trust that we shall=20

henceforth be able to think of them as nothing more than a troubled dream."=
  "What iss that you=20

will be sayin' about troubled dreams?" asked old McKay, coming out of the h=
ouse at the moment.=20



"We were just saying, daddy, that all our troubles seem--"  "Look yonder, T=
an," interrupted the old=20

man, pointing with his pipe-stem to a certain part of the heavens.  "What i=
ss it that I see?  A queer=20

cloud, whatever!  I don't remember seein' such a solid cloud as that in all=
 my experience."  "It is=20

indeed queer.  I hope it's not what Fred Jenkins would call a `squall brewi=
n' up,' for that wouldn't=20

improve the crops."  "A squall!" exclaimed Jenkins, who chanced to come rou=
nd the corner of the=20

house at the moment, with a spade on his shoulder.  "That's never a squall-=
-no, nor a gale, nor a=20

simoon, nor anything else o' the sort that I ever heard of.  Why, it's grow=
in' bigger an' bigger!"  He=20

shaded his eyes with his hand, and looked earnestly at the object in questi=
on, which did indeed=20

resemble a very dense, yet not a black, cloud.  For some moments the four s=
pectators gazed in=20

silence.  Then old McKay suddenly dropped his pipe, and looked at Dan with =
an expression of=20

intense solemnity.  "It iss my belief," he said in a hoarse whisper, "that =
it is them wee deevils the=20

grasshoppers!"  A very few minutes proved old McKay's surmise to be correct=
.  Once before, the=20

colony had been devastated by this plague, and the memory of the result was=
 enough to alarm the=20

most courageous among the settlers who had experienced the calamity, though=
 the new arrivals,=20

being ignorant, were disposed to regard the visitation lightly at first. Mc=
Kay himself became greatly=20

excited when the air became darkened by the cloud, which, ever increasing i=
n size, rapidly=20

approached.  "Haste ye, lads," he cried to some of the farm-servants who ha=
d joined the group on=20

the verandah, "get your spades, picks, an' shovels.  Be smart now: it is no=
t possible to save all the=20

crops, but we may try to save the garden, whatever.  Follow me!"  The garde=
n referred to was not=20

large or of great importance, but it was a favourite hobby of the Highlande=
r, and, at the time, was=20

in full bloom,=20


_
wonderful labour-saving machine.  After that the "Drownages" become the ord=
er of the day. The=20

red-capped Company recruits victims for the hecatomb, and over Nantes Town =
there hangs a pall=20

of unspeakable horror. The prisons are not vast enough to hold all the vict=
ims, so the huge=20

entrepot, the bonded warehouse on the quay, is converted: instead of chests=
 of coffee it is now=20

encumbered with human freight: into it pell-mell are thrown all those who a=
re destined to assuage=20

destruction at such a time, McKay would have given almost anything, and hav=
e gone almost any=20

lengths.  On this occasion, not knowing what to do, yet impelled by his eag=
erness to do=20

something, he adopted measures that he had heard of as being used in other =
lands.  He ordered a=20

trench to be cut and filled with water on the side of his garden nearest th=
e approaching plague,=20

which might--if thoroughly carried out--have been of some use against wingl=
ess grasshoppers but=20

could be=20
