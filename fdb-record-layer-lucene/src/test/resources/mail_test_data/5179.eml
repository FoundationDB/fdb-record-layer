philodendron monstera colony rapidly increased by the settlement of the ret=
urned pilgrims. Thus commenced the establishment of a new tribe upon foreig=
n soil, and, as the numbers of settlers increased to an important amount, p=
ermission was granted by the King of Abyssinia that they should occupy this=
 portion of his territory, upon payment brought worldly goods to every one,=
 Gyuri included, for it had given him the dearest little wife in the world.=
 They were married very soon and never had such a wedding taken place in Gl=
ogova before. According to Veronica's special wish, every one who had been =
at the Mravucsans' supper was invited to the wedding, for philodendron mons=
tera colony rapidly increased by the settlement of the returned pilgrims. T=
hus commenced the establishment of a new tribe upon foreign soil, and, as t=
he numbers of settlers increased to an important amount, permission was gra=
nted by the King of Abyssinia that they should occupy this portion of his t=
erritory, upon payment brought worldly goods to every one, Gyuri included, =
for it had given him the dearest little wife in the world. They were marrie=
d very soon and never had such a wedding taken place in Glogova before. Acc=
ording to Veronica's special wish, every one who had been at the Mravucsans=
' supper was invited to the wedding, for _
sickness was prevalent among all classes.  The Sheik Jemma was a Tokroori; =
and as these=20

people hate the Turks or Egyptians, although fanatical Mussulmans, he was e=
xceedingly cold=20

when he read my firman, that I had produced as a passport. He replied to my=
 demand for=20

assistance in men and camels, that "this was Abyssinia, and the firman of t=
he Viceroy of Egypt=20

was a bad introduction, as the Egyptians forced them to pay tribute at the =
point of the bayonet,=20

although they had no right to enter this country;" they paid taxes willingl=
y to the King of Abyssinia,=20

as he had a right to exact them. I explained that I was an Englishman, and =
no Turk, but that, as I=20

had travelled through the dominions of the Viceroy, I had been favoured wit=
h the sign-manual of=20

his Excellency Said Pasha, and I narrated in a few words the object of our =
expedition. He paid=20

very little attention, and merely asked me if I could send him some goat's =
milk, as he was very ill. I=20

was astonished at such a request, as there were great numbers of these anim=
als in the=20

neighbourhood; but he explained that his doctor had ordered him to drink th=
e milk of a black goat,=20

and he had heard that I had two of that colour. I promised him a supply, an=
d he agreed to assist=20

me in engaging camels and fresh men, as I had formerly arranged with my peo=
ple that their term=20

of service should expire upon our arrival at Gallabat or Metemma. The latte=
r name merely signifies=20

"the capital:" as many places are designated by the same word, it creates m=
uch confusion.  The=20

Sheik Jemma was the successor of Hamed, who formerly governed the Tokrooris=
. The Egyptians=20

had captured Hamed three years previously, during which time he had been im=
prisoned in Cairo.=20

Upon his release, he wrote to Jemma (who had governed pro tempore) to prepa=
re for his arrival;=20

but Jemma had no intention of vacating his seat, and he replied by an imper=
tinent message.=20

Hamed immediately applied to the Governor-General of the Soudan for assista=
nce, declaring=20

himself to be the subject of Egypt. Having obtained a powerful force, he ad=
vanced upon Gallabat,=20

and attacked Jemma, who came out to meet him. This happened about three mon=
ths before our=20

arrival. In a pitched battle, the Tokrooris were defeated with great loss, =
and Jemma, with the=20

greater portion of the population, sought the assistance of Theodore, the k=
ing of Abyssinia.=20

Theodore summoned the rival chiefs before him, and decided that, as Hamed h=
ad appealed to=20

Egypt for assistance, he should lose his seat, and remain a prisoner in Aby=
ssinia. Accordingly,=20

Jemma was declared to be the governor of the town of Gallabat, and the shei=
k over all Tokrooris.=20

The Tokrooris are natives of Darfur, who were converted to Mahometanism aft=
er the conquest of=20

Northern Africa by the Arabs. They are governed by a sultan in their own no=
r judge, only an=20

interested listener, surprised that the threads led nearer and nearer to he=
rself. Now Gyuri is=20

speaking of Mrs. Muencz's son, now Moricz is telling his story, which shows=
 that the umbrella=20

must be in Glogova. Then the forester's wife tells the tale of St. Peter's =
bringing the umbrella to the=20

orphan child. A few more words and the story was complete.  Veronica knew a=
ll, and her eyes=20

were swimming in tears.  "Oh, dear, how dreadful! Mrs. Adamecz burned the h=
andle!"  "God bless=20

her for it!" said Gyuri brightly, seeing the girl's depression, "for now at=
 least I can prove to you that=20

I love you for yourself alone."  Veronica had taken off the small red shawl=
 and was swinging it in=20

her hand. Suddenly she caught hold of Gyuri's arm, and smiled at him throug=
h her tears.  "Do you=20

really mean that you still want to marry me?"  "Of course. What do you say =
to it?"  "I say that ..."=20

She ceased speaking, for there was a queer feeling in her throat.  "Well?" =
 "That you are very=20

volatile, and ..."  "And?"  "And that ... Let us run back and look for my r=
ing."  With that she turned,=20

and ran as fast as she could to the part of the meadow in which they had be=
en standing when she=20



threw the ring away. Gyuri could hardly keep up with her.  They looked for =
the ring a long time, but=20

it was not to be found. And soon Father Janos appeared on the scene.  "I sa=
y, Gyuri, don't say=20

anything about the umbrella to my brother."  "No, my darling, I will never =
mention it."  His=20

reverence gave Veronica a good scolding.  "You naughty girl! Is that the wa=
y to behave? How you=20

frightened us! Of course you were chasing a butterfly?"  "No, I was running=
 away from one, but it=20

caught me."  "What, the butterfly?"  "Yes, that ugly, big butterfly standin=
g beside you."  His=20

reverence understood as much as he was meant to, and set to work, too, to l=
ook for the ring. But=20

they might have looked for it till Doomsday if Mr. Gongoly had not passed t=
hat way. Veronica had=20

quite despaired of finding the ring.  "Well, well, my dear," said the nabob=
 of Glogova, shaking back=20

his long gray hair, "never mind, trust in Gongoly, he will find it for you.=
 There is only one way to do=20

it, so in an hour's time they will be making hay in this field."         * =
      *       *       *       *  Though=20

the grass was not two inches high (it had only been cut a fortnight before)=
, Mr. Gongoly sent his=20

men there to mow it, with the result that next day the ring was safely rest=
ing on Veronica's finger.=20

And for years the people spoke of the wonderful fact that in that year Mr. =
Gongoly's meadow gave=20

two crops of hay, and it was always mentioned if any one spoke disparagingl=
y of the Glogova=20

fields.  What more am I to say? I think I have told my story conscientiousl=
y. All the same there are=20

some things that will never be known=20


_
prohibits the entrance of white men; thus Darfur remains impenetrable to ci=
vilization. That country=20

is extremely arid and unfruitful; thus, as the pilgrims journeyed towards M=
ecca from their own=20

inhospitable soil, they passed through a land flowing with milk and honey, =
with excellent pasturage=20

and fertile soil, in the district of Gallabat. As first settlements of men =
have always been caused by=20

some local attraction and advantage, so the Tokroori pilgrims, on their ret=
urn from Mecca,=20

originally rested from the fatigues of their journey in the neighbourhood o=
f Gallabat, as a country=20

preferable to their own. The establishment of a few settlers formed a nucle=
us, and, as successive=20

pilgrimages to Mecca were annually instance, what really became of Pal Greg=
orics' fortune, for=20

there is no sign of it to this day. Was the supposed receipt in the handle =
of the umbrella or not? No=20

one will ever know, not even little Matyko, who drank the water with three =
sparks in it. No king=20

drinks such precious liquid as he did--if the story be true.  The legend of=
 the holy umbrella is still=20

believed in in those parts. Mr. Sztolarik, who was fond of a gossip, certai=
nly told his version of the=20

story, how old Muencz the Jew had made a present to Christianity of a holy =
relic, and so on; but=20

the old belief was strongly rooted, and he was only laughed at when he told=
 his tale. And after all,=20

there was something mystic and strange in the whole affair, and=20
