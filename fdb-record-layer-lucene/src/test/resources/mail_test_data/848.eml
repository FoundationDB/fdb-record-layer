irst night of her watch she had asked the invalid if he _
overturned furniture and broken glass.  "A few minutes longer, citizen Fleu=
ry," said Chauvelin, as=20

the commandant of the Marats turned on his heel and started to go back to t=
he Carrefour de la=20

Poissonnerie.  "Oh yes!" whispered the latter, "we'll wait awhile longer to=
 give the Englishmen time=20

to arrive on the scene. The coast is clear for them--my Marats are hidden f=
rom sight behind the=20

doorways and shop-fronts of the houses opposite. In about three minutes fro=
m now I'll send them=20

forward."  "And good luck to your hunting, citizen," whispered Chauvelin in=
 response.  Fleury very=20

quickly disappeared in the darkness and the other two men followed in his w=
ake. They hugged the=20

wall of the Rat Mort as they went along and its shadow enveloped them compl=
etely: their shoes=20

made no sound on the unpaved ground. Chauvelin's nostrils quivered as he dr=
ew the keen, cold=20

air into his lungs and faced the north-westerly blast which at this moment =
also lashed the face of=20

his enemy. His keen eyes tried to pierce the gloom, his ears were strained =
to hear that merry peal=20

of laughter which in the unforgettable past had been wont to proclaim the p=
resence of the reckless=20

adventurer. He knew--he felt--as certainly as he felt the air which he brea=
thed, that the man whom=20

he hated beyond everything on earth was somewhere close by, wrapped in the =
murkiness of the=20

night--thinking, planning, intriguing, pitting his sharp wits, his indomita=
ble pluck, his impudent dare-

devilry against the sure and patient trap which had been set for him.  Half=
 a company of Marats in=20

front--the walls of Le Bouffay in the rear! Chauvelin rubbed his thin hands=
 together!  "You are not a=20

disembodied ghost, my fine Scarlet Pimpernel," he murmured, "and this time =
I really think----"=20

CHAPTER VII  THE FRACAS IN THE TAVERN   I  Yvonne had settled herself in a =
corner of the=20

tap-room on a bench and had tried to lose consciousness of her surroundings=
.  It was not easy!=20

Glances charged with rancour were levelled at her dainty appearance--dainty=
 and refined despite=20

the look of starvation and of weariness on her face and the miserable state=
 of her clothing--and not=20

a few muttered insults waited on those glances.  As soon as she was seated =
Yvonne noticed that=20

the old man and the coarse, fat woman behind the bar started an animated co=
nversation together,=20

of which she was very obviously the object, for the two heads--the lean and=
 the round--were jerked=20

more than once in her direction. Presently the man--it was George Lemoine, =
the proprietor of the=20

Rat Mort--came up to where she was sitting: his lank figure was bent so tha=
t his lean back formed=20

the best part of an arc, and an expression of mock deference further distor=
ted his ugly face.  He=20

came up quite close to Yvonne and she found it passing difficult not to dra=
w away from him, for the=20

leer on his face was appalling: his eyes, which were set very near to his h=
ooked nose, had a=20

horrible squint, his lips were thick and moist, and his breath reeked of al=
cohol.  "What will the=20

noble lady deign to drink?" he now asked in an oily, suave voice.  And Yvon=
ne, remembering the=20

guide's admonitions, contrived to smile unconcernedly into the hideous  The=
 poor boy was terribly=20

alarmed at this.  He had wit enough to perceive that prompt action was need=
ed, for his friend was=20

in very great danger, while the buffalo runners were by that time out of si=
ght in front, and the camp=20

was far behind.  In this crisis Billie acted with decision.  First making t=
he bandage over the wound=20

more secure, and pouring a little more water into the mouth of the wounded =
man, he went to a=20

clump of willows, and cut a stout switch, then, remounting, he turned on hi=
s track and made=20

straight for the camp as fast as his willing pony could be made to lay hoof=
 to the ground.  Arrived=20

there, to his great relief he found the Cree chief Okematan, for that eccen=
tric individual had, owing=20

to some unknown reason, refrained from joining in the hunt that day.  La Ce=
rte was also there.  In=20

a few minutes, mounted on a fresh horse, Little Bill was galloping over the=
 prairie, acting as guide=20



to Okematan, while La Certe followed them, driving a cart with a couple of =
buffalo-robes in it.  That=20

night, instead of rejoicing in the camp of the buffalo runners after their =
successful hunt, there was=20

uneasiness and gloom, for Duncan McKay lay in his tent dangerously wounded,=
 and it was=20

generally believed that the shot which laid him low had been fired not by a=
ccident, but with=20

deliberate intent to kill.    CHAPTER THIRTY TWO.  SUFFERING AND ITS RESULT=
S.  When the=20

news that young Duncan had been shot was brought to Ben Nevis, the effect o=
n his father was=20

much more severe than might have been expected, considering their respectiv=
e feelings towards=20

each other.  It was late in the evening when the news came, and the old man=
 was seated in what=20

he styled his smoking-room, taking his evening glass of whisky and water.  =
"Elspie," he said, in a=20

subdued voice, on being told, "help me up to my bed."  This was so very unu=
sual a request that=20

Elspie was somewhat alarmed by it, as well as surprised--all the more so th=
at the old man left the=20

room without finishing either his pipe or glass.  Still, she did not suppos=
e that anything serious=20

would come of it.  A night's rest, she thought, would do away with the evil=
s of the shock.  "Dear=20

father," she said, as she kissed him at parting, "do believe that God is wa=
iting to be gracious: that=20

He really means it when He says, `Come unto me, all ye that labour and are =
heavy laden, and I=20

will give you rest.'  And, consider--we have no reason to suppose that dear=
 Duncan's wound is=20

very dangerous."  "Goot-night, Elspie," was all the reply.  Next morning Mc=
Kay did not make his=20

appearance at the usual breakfast-hour, and, on going to his room, they fou=
nd him lying=20

speechless in his bed, suffering under a stroke of paralysis.  He soon reco=
vered the power of=20

speech, but not the use of his limbs, and it became evident ere long that t=
he poor man had=20

received a shock which would probably cripple him for life.  Whatever may h=
ave been his secret=20

thoughts, however, he carefully concealed them from every one, and always r=
eferred to his=20

complaint as, "this nasty stiff feeling about the legs which iss a long tim=
e of goin' away--whatever."=20

In a few days, Fergus returned from the plains, bringing his brother in a=
=20


_
"I would very much like some wine," she said cheerfully, "but I am afraid t=
hat I have no money=20

wherewith to pay you for it."  The creature with a gesture of abject humili=
ty rubbed his greasy=20

hands together.  "And may I respectfully ask," he queried blandly, "what ar=
e the intentions of the=20

noble lady in coming to this humble abode, if she hath no desire to partake=
 of refreshments?"  "I=20

am expecting friends," replied Yvonne bravely; "they will be here very soon=
, and will gladly repay=20

you lavishly for all the kindness which you may be inclined to show to me t=
he while."  She was=20

very brave indeed and looked this awful misshapen specimen of a man quite b=
oldly in the face:=20

she even contrived to smile, though she was well aware that a number of men=
 and women--

perhaps a dozen altogether--had congregated in front of her in a compact gr=
oup around the=20

landlord, that they were nudging one another and pointing derisively--malev=
olently--at her. It was=20

impossible, despite all attempts at valour, to mistake the hostile attitude=
 of these people. Some of=20

the most obscene words, coined during these last horrible days of the Revol=
ution, were freely=20

hurled at her, and one woman suddenly cried out in a shrill treble:  "Throw=
 her out, citizen=20

Lemoine! We don't want spies in here!"  "Indeed, indeed," said Yvonne as qu=
ietly as she could, "I=20

am no spy. I am poor and wreched like yourselves! and of pine-branches.  Th=
ey did not tell him at=20

first of his father's illness, lest it should interfere with his own recove=
ry from the very critical=20

condition in which he lay.  At first he took no notice of his father's non-=
appearance, attributing it to=20

indifference; but when he began slowly to mend, he expressed some surprise.=
  Then they told him.=20

Whatever may have been his thoughts on the subject, he gave no sign, but re=
ceived the=20

information--as, indeed, he received nearly all information at that time--i=
n absolute silence.=20

Fortunately, the bullet which struck him had passed right through his side,=
 so that he was spared=20

the pain, as well as the danger, of its extraction.  But, from his total lo=
ss of appetite and continued=20

weakness, it was evident that he had received some very severe, if not fata=
l, internal injury.  At=20

last, very slowly, he began to grow a little stronger, but he was a very sh=
adow or wreck of his=20

former self. Nevertheless, the more sanguine members of the family began to=
 entertain some faint=20

hope of his recovery.  Of course, during these first days of his weakness h=
is sister Elspie nursed=20

him.  She would, if permitted, have done so night and day, but in this matt=
er she had to contend=20

with one who was more than a match for her.  This was Old Peg, the faithful=
 domestic.  "No, no,=20

dearie," said that resolute old woman, when Elspie first promulgated to her=
 the idea of=20


_
the kind friends who will meet me here anon."  "Aristos like yourself!" gro=
wled one of the men.=20

"This is no place for you or for them."  "No! No! This is no place for aris=
tos," cried one of the=20

women in a voice which many excesses and many vices had rendered hoarse and=
 rough. "Spy or=20

not, we don't want you in here. Do we?" she added as with arms akimbo she t=
urned to face those=20

of her own sex, who behind the men had come up in order to see what was goi=
ng on.  "Throw her=20

out, Lemoine," reiterated a man who appeared to be an oracle amongst the ot=
hers.  "Please!=20

please let me stop here!" pleaded Yvonne; "if you turn me out I shall not k=
now what to do: I shall=20

not know where to meet my friends...."  "Pretty story about those friends,"=
 broke in Lemoine=20

roughly. "How do I know if you're will do nothin' of the sort.  Your sainte=
d mother left your father an'=20

Fergus an' yourself to my care, an' I said I would never fail you, so I can=
't break my promise by=20

letting you break your health.  I will sit up wi' him, as I've done many a =
time when he was a bairn."=20

It thus came to pass that Elspie nursed her brother by day, and Old Peg sat=
 up with him at night.=20

Of course the duties of the former were considerably lightened by the assis=
tance rendered by=20

various members of the family, as well as friends, who were ever ready to s=
it by the bedside of the=20

wounded man and read to or chat with him.  At such times he was moderately =
cheerful, but when=20

the night watches came, and Old Peg took her place beside him, and memory h=
ad time to=20

commence with him undisturbed, the deed of which=20


_
From the opposite angle of the room, the woman behind the bar had been watc=
hing the little scene=20

with eyes that glistened with cupidity. Now she emerged from behind her str=
onghold of bottles and=20

mugs and slowly waddled across the room. She pushed her way unceremoniously=
 past her=20

customers, elbowing men, women and children vigorously aside with a deft pl=
ay of her large,=20

muscular arms. Having reached the forefront of the little group she came to=
 a standstill=20

immediately in front of Yvonne, and crossing her mighty arms over her ponde=
rous chest she eyed=20

the "aristo" with unconcealed malignity.  "We do know that the slut is lyin=
g--that is where you make=20

the mistake, Lemoine. A slut, that's what she is--and the friend whom she's=
 going to meet ...?=20

Well!" she added, turning with an ugly leer toward the other women, "we all=
 know what sort of=20

friend that one is likely to be, eh, mesdames? Bringing evil fame on this h=
ouse, that's what the=20

wench is after ... so as to bring the police about our ears ... I wouldn't =
trust her, not another minute.=20

Out with you and at once--do you him; Conscience was awakened, and self-con=
demnation was=20

the result. Yet, so inconsistent is poor humanity that self-exculpation war=
red with self-

condemnation in the same brain!  The miserable man would have given all he =
possessed to have=20

been able to persuade himself that his act was purely one of self-defence--=
as no doubt to some=20

extent it was, for if he had not fired first Perrin's action showed that he=
 would certainly have been=20

the man-slayer.  But, then, young McKay could not shut his eyes to the fact=
 that premeditation=20

had, in the first instance, induced him to extend his hand towards his gun,=
 and this first act it was=20

which had caused all the rest.  Often during the wakeful hours of the night=
 would the invalid glance=20

at his nurse with a longing desire to unburden his soul to her, but wheneve=
r his eye rested on her=20

calm, wrinkled old visage, and he thought of her deafness, and the difficul=
ty of making her=20

understand, he abandoned his half-formed intention with a sigh.  He did not=
, indeed, doubt her=20

sympathy, for many a time during his life, especially when a=20
