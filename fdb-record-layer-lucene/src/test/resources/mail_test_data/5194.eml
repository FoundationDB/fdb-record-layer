this period is obscure. David reigned in Hebron seven years and a half, and=
 as Ishbosheth's=20

phantom sovereignty only occupied two of these years, and those evidently t=
he last, it would=20

appear almost as if the Philistines had held the country, with the exceptio=
n of Judah, in such force=20

that no rival cared to claim the dangerous dignity, and that five years pas=
sed before the invaders=20

were so far cleared out as to leave leisure for civil war.  [Q] The Canaani=
tish worship of Baal=20

seems to have lingered in Saul's family. One of his grand-uncles was named =
Baal (1 Chron. ix.=20

36); his son was really called Eshbaal (Fire of Baal), which was contemptuo=
usly converted into=20

Ishbosheth (Man of Shame). So also Mephibosheth was properly Meribbaal (Fig=
hter for Baal).=20

The summary narrative of these seven years presents the still youthful king=
 in a very lovable light.=20

The same temper which had marked his first acts after Saul's death is strik=
ingly brought out (2=20

Sam. ii.-iv.) He seems to have left the conduct of the war altogether to Jo=
ab, as if he shrank from=20

striking a single blow for his own advancement. When he does interfere, it =
is on the side of peace,=20

to curb and chastise ferocious vengeance and dastardly assassination. The i=
ncidents recorded all=20

go to make up a picture of rare generosity, of patient doubting whether I s=
hould not back out of the=20

whole subject, in stalked her ladyship, very white, with lips compressed, a=
nd an expression on her=20

face which so terrified Ursula that she forgot my speech in the amazement a=
nd alarm which her=20

mother's aspect caused her. "What are you doing in my daughter's private si=
tting-room, Lord=20

Frank?" said Lady Broadhem, between her teeth.  "I came to tell her of your=
 sudden illness, and=20

explain the cause of it," I replied, calmly.  "And have you done so?" and I=
 saw how much=20

depended on my answer by the nervous way in which Lady Broadhem clenched he=
r hand to=20

control her emotion: she has given me a good many _mauvais quarts d'heures_=
, I thought--I will=20

give her one now.  "I was just telling Lady Ursula," I said, "that Mr Chund=
ango had positively had=20

the impudence to propose to you"--Lady Broadhem gave a sort of suppressed s=
cream--"when you=20

came in."  "Then you did not tell her what he proposed?" she said.  "No, I =
leave that to you," I said,=20

maliciously.  "My dear Ursula, I would not tell you, because I know you do =
not approve of=20

speculations, and I feel myself that they are questionable, if not actually=
 sinful. My dear child, I did=20

it for the best; Chundango wanted me to join him in one of his Indian specu=
lations, and proposed=20

to me to"--Lady Broadhem=20
