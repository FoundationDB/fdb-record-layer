to the left. He was more than willing to delay, even by littles, the moment when he should be 

obliged to resume the sorry business of waiting and dissembling.  Miss Anners glanced at the tiny 

watch pinned upon her shoulder.  "Shall we have time? It's getting late."  "Plenty of time for all we 

shall be able to do or see up here," Blount returned. "The road ends at the canyon head, a mile 

above. There is a very small and very exclusive summer-resort hotel, called the Shonoho Inn, on 

the upper level. It has a six-weeks' season--like the Florida resorts--they tell me, and it is closed 

now."  It was within the next five hundred yards that the prediction that there would be nothing to 

see anticipated its fulfilment. At a sudden turn in the narrow defile they came Captain; I have told 

him so to his face, and that was the foundation of his reformation."  Captain Ringgold concluded to 

hear the story.     CHAPTER XXXVI  AN ALMOST MIRACULOUS CONVERSION   It was a long 

story which Captain Penn Sharp told of his relations with Ali-Noury Pacha; and his visitor was so 

incredulous at first that he appeared to have solemnly resolved not to accept anything as the truth. 

But the character of the speaker left its impress all along the narrative; and Captain Ringgold was 

compelled to believe, just as the hardened sinner is sometimes forced to accept the truth when 

presented to him by the true evangelist, though his teeth were set against it.  "You gentlemen with 

millions in your trousers pockets are subject to perils which we of

shortly, and he turned the car and let it roll back down the grade to the main gulch.  When they 

were once more speeding toward town Blount stole a glance at his companion, wondering if it 

were the small disappointment which made her silent.  "Are you tired?" he asked quickly.  "Oh, 

no," she rejoined, brightening again. "I have enjoyed every minute of it. I was just thinking of what I 

said a little while ago; of how it is going to break my heart to leave it all."  It was on the tip of his 

tongue to tell her that she needn't leave it. But he remembered and caught himself sharply. When 

the dreadful Tuesday should have come and gone, she might be only too willing to go away; and, 

in any event, he would have to go. There would be no place in his own and his father's State for 

him after Gryson returned, and the match had been touched to the hidden mine of high explosives. 

This was what was in his mind when he said rather tamely: "I suppose you will have to the 

Blanche began.  "That means you, and not me," suggested the visitor.  "You have the reputation 

of being a rich man, whether you are one or not. My wife is rich, and I am only well off; but never 

mind that now," replied Captain Sharp. "I saw General Noury, as we will call him after this if you do 

not object, for that is the name by which he chooses to be known, in Gibraltar several times, and I 

knew all about your affair with him there; but I did not get acquainted with him, for I despised him 

as much as you did.  "I sailed from the Rock, and took my wife to a great many of the ports of 

Europe, and some in Africa, including Egypt; but I am not going to tell you about our travels. We 

went from Alexandria to Malta, Syracuse, and to Messina; and it was at this last port that I fell in 

with General Noury. His steamer, I forget her name,"--  "The Fatime; but Felix McGavonty always 

called her the Fatty."  "The Fatty anchored within a cable's length of me before I had been there 

two hours, and the Pacha went ashore at once. That night my wife

"No," she responded half-absently; and thereupon he gave the little car still more spark and 

throttle and sent it flying over the final stretch of the fine road to the city.  The electric lights were 

showing like faint yellow stars against the sunset sky when Blount skilfully placed the small car at 

the Inter-Mountain curb and lifted his companion to the sidewalk.  "Are you was sick, and I went to 

the city to procure a certain medicine for her. I happened into a shop where no one could speak 

English, and I don't speak anything else. I was just going off to find another place where they did
