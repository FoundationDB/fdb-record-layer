ed Sam.  "A big-horn=20

sheep for mine!" was Nat's stipulation.  "I'd like a mountain lion," remark=
ed Bony.  "How about you,=20

Budge?" asked Jack.  "'FIkillanelkI'llbesatisfied," was the answer.  "An el=
k!" exclaimed Jack. "I=20

guess so! Why, I'd like that myself."  "Well, I thought I might as well wis=
h for something big while I=20

was at it," said Budge calmly, as he stowed away some fresh gum.  Under the=
 guidance of Long=20

Gun they mounted their horses and started out for their first hunt in that =
region. The Indian gave=20

them some good advice about how to shoot, for going after big game was some=
thing new to them.=20

"If git lost, fire gun," was the Indian's final word of caution.  They rode=
 on together for a mile or=20

more, but got no sight of any game.  "I think we'd better separate," sugges=
ted Jack. "We'll never=20

get anything if we stick together. Let's try it alone. We can meet at some =
central point. Eh, Long=20

Gun?"  "Hu!" grunted the Indian. "Git lost, maybe."  "That's right," assent=
ed Bony. "I don't want to=20

go off alone."  "Well, Nat and I will strike off to the left," went on Jack=
. "You, Sam and Budge can=20

keep with Long Gun and go to the right. We'll meet by that big peak over th=
ere," and he pointed to=20

one that could easily be seen.  This was agreed to, the Indian giving his c=
onsent with a grunt, and=20

then Jack and Nat started off alone.  "I hope we get something," remarked J=
ack when they had=20

traveled for a mile or more.  "Same here," added Nat. "Let's go closer to t=
hat bad lands section=20

Long Gun told us of."  "I'm afraid we'll get lost," objected Jack.  The bad=
 lands, as they are called,=20

are a peculiar tract covered with ten thousand little sawtooth peaks and co=
nes of earth and=20

sandstone, rising abruptly from the plain, and so closely set together, and=
 so lacking in any=20

distinctive objects to mark them, that one can wander about in them as in a=
 maze. The two lads=20

had been hunting on the edge of them, but had not ventured in.  "Oh, I gues=
s we can find our way=20

back, if we don't go in too far," said Nat.  "Well," began Jack a little do=
ubtfully, "I don't know----"=20

And then he saw something that made him change his mind.  "Look!" he whispe=
red to Nat, and his=20

chum, looking where Jack pointed, saw a big deer, just on the edge of the b=
ad lands, and about to=20

enter them.  "It's a buck!" exclaimed Nat, bringing his rifle around.  "We'=
ll follow him and get a=20

shot," decided Jack, and they left their horses and began to stalk the big =
buck. Fortunately the=20

wind was blowing from him to them, or the animal might have taken fright. A=
s it was, they were not=20

far behind him when he entered the maze of little peaks.  Several times the=
y thought they were in=20

a position to get a good shot, but each time the deer moved just as one or =
the other of the lads=20

was drawing a bead on him.  Finally Jack got just the chance he wanted. Kne=
eling down he took=20

quick aim and pulled the trigger. The report that followed nearly deafened =
him and Nat, so many=20

were the echoes, but when the smoke cleared away they saw the big deer lyin=
g on the ground not=20

far away.  [Illustration: "KNEELING DOWN, HE TOOK QUICK conduct. In many fa=
milies, at ten=20

o'clock on the sabbath, attendance at church is still an open question. The=
re is no open question=20

on Monday morning--'John, will you go to work to-day?'"  A minister rebuked=
 a farmer for not=20

attending church, and said, "You know John you are never absent from market=
."  "O," was the=20

reply, "we _must_ go to market."  Some one has said that without the sabbat=
h the church of Christ=20

could not, as a visible organization, exist on earth. Another has said that=
 "we need to be in the drill=20

of observance as well as in the liberty of faith." Human nature is so treac=
herous that we are apt to=20

omit things altogether unless there is some special reason for doing them. =
A man is not likely to=20

worship at all unless he has regularly appointed times and means for worshi=
p. Family and private=20

devotions are almost certain to be omitted altogether unless one gets into =
the habit, and has a=20



special time set apart daily.  A REMINISCENCE.  I remember blaming my mothe=
r for sending me=20

to church on the sabbath. On one occasion the preacher had to send some one=
 into the gallery to=20

wake me up. I thought it was hard to have to work in the field all the week=
, and then to be obliged=20

to go to church and hear a sermon I didn't understand. I thought I wouldn't=
 go to church any more=20

when I got away from home; but I had got so in the habit of going that I co=
uldn't stay away. After=20

one or two sabbaths, back again to the house of God I went. There I first f=
ound Christ, and I have=20

often said since,  "Mother, I thank you for making me go to the house of Go=
d when I didn't want to=20

go."  Parents, if you want your children to grow up and honor you, have the=
m honor the sabbath=20

day. Don't let them go off fishing, and getting into bad company, or it won=
't be long before they will=20

come home and curse you. I know few things more beautiful than to see a fat=
her and mother=20

coming up the aisle with their daughters and sons, and sitting down togethe=
r to hear the Word of=20

God. It is a good thing to have the children, not in some remote loft or ga=
llery, but in a good place,=20

well in sight. Though they cannot understand the sermon now, when they get =
older they won't=20

desire to break away, they will continue attending public worship in the ho=
use of God.  But we=20

must not mistake the means for the end. We must not think that the sabbath =
is just for the sake of=20

being able to attend meetings. There are some people who think they must sp=
end the whole day=20

at meetings or private devotions. The result is that at nightfall they are =
tired out, and the day has=20

brought them no rest. The number of church services attended ought to be me=
asured by the=20

person's ability to enjoy them and get good from them, without being wearie=
d. Attending meetings=20

is not the only way to observe the sabbath. The Israelites were commanded t=
o keep it in their=20

dwellings as well as in holy convocation. The home, that centre of so great=
 influence over the life=20

and character of the people, ought to be made the scene of true sabbath obs=
ervance.  HOME=20

OBSERVANCE.  Jeremiah classified godless families with the heathen: "Pour o=
ut thy fury upon=20

the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that=20


_
TRIGGER."]  "You've got him!" cried Nat.  "Our first big game!" exclaimed J=
ack as he ran forward.=20

"My, but he's big!" commented Nat. "How we going back to camp?"  "Put him o=
n the horses, of=20

course," said Jack. "We can do it. We'll lead them up here."  "Sure," respo=
nded Nat. "I call not on=20

thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, devoured him, and consumed him, and=
 have made his=20

habitation desolate."  Many mothers have written to me at one time or anoth=
er to know what to do=20

to entertain their children on the sabbath. The boys say, "I do wish 'twas =
Night,"=20


_
in."  They started back, full of confidence in their ability to find where =
they had tethered the=20

animals. They walked on for half an hour, and then Jack said:  "Say, it see=
ms to me we're a long=20

time finding those horses."  "That's right," agreed Nat. "We didn't take so=
 long coming in here. I=20

guess we came the wrong way."  "I'm sure of it," declared Jack. "We should =
have gone to the=20

right."  "No, the left."  They discussed it for some time, and finally deci=
ded to try the right. They=20

went on for some sabbath was over." It ought to be the happiest day in the =
week to them, one to=20

be looked forward to with pleasure. In order to this end, many suggestions =
might be followed.=20

Make family prayers especially attractive by having the children learn some=
 verse or story from the=20

Bible. Give more time to your children than you can give on week days, read=
ing to them and=20

perhaps taking them to walk in the afternoon or evening. Show by your condu=
ct that the sabbath is=20

a delight, and they will soon catch your spirit.=20
