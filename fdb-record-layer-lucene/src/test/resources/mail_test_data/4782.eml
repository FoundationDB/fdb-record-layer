In Soorah 55 a refrain is found, and traces of a like imitation in Soorahs =
54 and 17. It is probable=20

that the Kur-an was originally _chanted_ in somewhat the same manner as it =
is in the present day.=20

The Kur-an is also divided in thirty sections, and these are again subdivid=
ed; and from this division=20

rather than from chapter and verse do the Muslims generally quote.  'The Mu=
slims absolutely deny=20

that the Kur-an was composed by their Prophet himself, or by any other for =
him; it being their=20

general and orthodox belief that it is of divine original; nay, that it is =
eternal and uncreated,=20

remaining, as some express it, in the very essence of God; that the first t=
ranscript has been from=20

everlasting by God's throne, written on a tablet of vast size, called the P=
reserved Tablet, in which=20

are also recorded the divine decrees, past and future; that a copy from thi=
s tablet, in one volume=20

on paper, was, by the ministry of the angel Gabriel, sent down to the lowes=
t heaven, in the month=20

of Ramadan, on the Night of Power;[24] whence Gabriel revealed it to Mohamm=
ad by parcels,=20

some at Mekka, and some at Medina, at different times during the space of t=
wenty-three years, as=20

the exigency of affairs required; giving him, however, the consolation to s=
how him the whole=20

(which they tell us was bound in silk, and adorned with gold and precious s=
tones of Paradise) once=20

a year; but in the last year of his life he had the favour to see it twice.=
 They say that few chapters=20

were delivered entire, the most part being revealed piecemeal, and written =
down from time to time=20

by the Prophet's amanuensis, in such or such a part of such or such a chapt=
er, till they were=20

completed, according to the directions of the angel. The first parcel that =
was revealed is generally=20

agreed to have been the first five verses of the ninety-sixth chapter. Afte=
r the new revealed=20

passages had been from the Prophet's mouth taken down in writing by his scr=
ibe, they were=20

published to his followers, several of whom took copies for their private u=
se; but the far greater=20

number got them by heart. The originals, when returned, were put promiscuou=
sly into a chest,=20

without regard to any order of time, for which reason it is uncertain when =
many passages were=20

revealed.  'The Kur-an being the Muslims' rule of faith and practice, it is=
 no wonder its expositors=20

and commentators are so very numerous; and it may not be amiss to take noti=
ce of the rules they=20

observe in expounding it.  'One of the most learned commentators distinguis=
hes the contents of=20

the Kur-an into allegorical and literal. The former comprehends the more ob=
scure, parabolical, and=20

enigmatical passages, and such as are repealed or abrogated; the latter, th=
ose which are plain,=20

perspicuous, liable to no doubt, and in full force.  'To explain these seve=
rally in a right manner, it is=20

necessary, from tradition and study, to know the time when each passage was=
 revealed, its=20

circumstances, state, and history, and the reasons or particular emergencie=
s for the sake of which=20

it was revealed. Or, more explicitly, whether the passage was revealed at M=
ekka or at Medina;=20

whether it be abrogated, or does itself abrogate any other passage; whether=
 it be anticipated in=20

order of time or postponed; whether it be distinct from the context or depe=
nd thereon; whether it be=20

particular or general; and lastly, whether it be implicit by intention, or =
explicit in words.  'By what=20

has been said, the reader may easily believe that this book is held by the =
Muslims in the greatest=20

reverence and esteem. The more strict among them dare not touch it without =
being first washed or=20

legally purified; which lest they should do by inadvertence, they sometimes=
 write these words of=20

the book itself on the cover or label, "None shall touch it but they who ar=
e purified." They read it=20

with great care and respect, never holding it below their girdles. They swe=
ar by it, consult it in their=20

weighty occasions, carry it with them to war, inscribe sentences from it on=
 their banners,=20

sometimes adorn it with gold and precious stones, and knowingly suffer it n=
ot to be in the=20



possession of any person of a different persuasion. It is the foundation of=
 their education; and the=20

children in the schools are taught to chant it, and commit the whole of it =
to memory.'     BOOKS.=20

In reading a large number of works bearing upon the subjects of this Introd=
uction, I have remarked=20

a curious freedom of quotation in most of the writers. I find the same sent=
ence, or at least the=20

same thought, repeated in several books without any reference to the author=
 who first put it forth.=20

Each writer seems to have studied his predecessors with such minuteness tha=
t he can quote their=20

very words, but he does not appear to remember whence the words "Plain Vani=

explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you received the =
work on a physical=20

medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.  The pers=

If you received the work=20


_
thought has once been perfectly expressed, it were a ridiculous vanity to s=
eek to frame it in=20

different words, and so far it is undoubtedly wise to make use of the best =
of what has preceded us;=20

nevertheless, it is well to acknowledge our debt. Yet thoughts, providing i=
t to you may choose to=20

give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of=
 a refund.  If the second=20

copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further =
opportunities to fix the=20

problem.  1.F.4.=20


_
impress themselves on the memory till one unconsciously comes to appropriat=
e them as his own;=20

and this, I doubt not, is the cause of much of the plagiarism I have notice=
d. It is extremely probable=20

that I have been guilty of the same sin. I have crowded my pages with marks=
 of quotation,=20

sometimes with foot references, sometimes without (for the student of the s=
ubject will know where=20

to look for them), but it is quite likely that I have often unconsciously u=
sed another's phrase or=20

metaphor without rendering thanks. So I now append a list of the principal =
European books I have=20

used, and beg once and for all to record my indebtedness to their writers. =
The original Arabic=20

authorities will dispense with my acknowledgments, and the catalogue of the=
