He was hailed with a general chorus of laughter;   Young BAL seemed abashed at the general

Horse _looks_ pretty fit,     And the boy sits him well, and as though he meant _trying_.   I say, this 

won't do! I must bounce him a bit.     Most awkward, you know, if his "slug" takes to _flying_! 

_Rising Young Jockey_ (_aside_). Hillo! There's Old WILLIAM! He's out           on the scoot.     The 

artful Old Hand! Hope he'll like what he looks on!   He slated this nag as a peacocky brute, 

Whose utter collapse they've been building their books on.   How now, my spry veteran? Only

There isn't a Jock who is defter _and_ bolder;   Your power, authority, eloquence--yes,     For your 

gift of the gab is a caution--are splendid;   But--the youngster _may_ teach you a lesson, I guess, 

As to judgment of pace ere the contest is ended.  _Grand Old Jockey_ (_aloud_). Well, ARTHUR 

my lad, in the saddle           again!     Is _that_ your crack mount?  _Rising Young tortures of the 

damned.  When they reached the street, Aramis said:  "Well, Athos, what do you think?"  "Of 

whom?"  "Pardieu! of Monsieur de Bouillon."  "My friend, I think that he is much troubled with 

gout."  "You noticed that I didn't breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit?"  "You did well; you
