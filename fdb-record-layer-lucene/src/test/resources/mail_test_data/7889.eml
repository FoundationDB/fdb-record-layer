be trained. In the second I have discussed the supplies of material of which buildings are 

constructed. In the third, which deals with the arrangements of temples and their variety of form, I 

showed the nature and number of their classes, with the adjustments proper to each form 

according to the usage of the Ionic order, one of the three which exhibit the greatest delicacy of 

proportion in their symmetrical measurements. In the present book I shall speak of the established 

rules for the Doric and Corinthian orders, and shall explain their differences and peculiarities. 

CHAPTER I  THE ORIGINS OF THE THREE ORDERS, AND THE PROPORTIONS OF THE 

CORINTHIAN CAPITAL   1. Corinthian columns are, excepting in their capitals, of the same 

proportions in all respects as Ionic; but the height of their capitals gives them proportionately a 

taller and more slender effect. This is because the height of the Ionic capital is only one third of the 

thickness of the column, while that of the Corinthian is the entire thickness of the shaft. Hence, as 

two thirds are added in Corinthian capitals, their tallness gives a more slender appearance to the 

columns themselves.  2. The other members which are placed above the columns, are, for 

Corinthian columns, composed either of the Doric proportions or according to the Ionic usages; for 

the Corinthian order never had any scheme peculiar to itself for its cornices or other ornaments, 

but may have mutules in the coronae and guttae on the architraves according to the triglyph 

system of the Doric style, or, according to Ionic practices, it may be arranged with a frieze adorned 

with sculptures and accompanied with dentils and coronae.  3. Thus a third architectural order, 

distinguished by its capital, was produced out of the two other orders. To the forms of their 

columns are due the names of the three orders, Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, of which the Doric 

was the first to arise, and in early times. For Dorus, the son of Hellen and the nymph Phthia, was 

king of Achaea and all the Peloponnesus, and he built a fane, which chanced to be of this order, in 

the precinct of Juno at Argolis, a very ancient city, and subsequently others of the same order in 

the other cities of Achaea, although the rules of symmetry were not yet in existence.  4. Later, the 

Athenians, in obedience to oracles of the Delphic Apollo, and with the general agreement of all 

Hellas, despatched thirteen colonies at one time to Asia Minor, appointing leaders for each colony 

and giving the command-in-chief to Ion, son of Xuthus and Creusa (whom further Apollo at Delphi 

in the oracles had acknowledged as his son). Ion conducted those colonies to Asia Minor, took 

possession of the land of Caria, and there founded the grand cities of Ephesus, Miletus, Myus 

(long ago engulfed by the water, and its sacred rites and suffrage handed over by the Ionians to 

the Milesians), Priene, Samos, Teos, Colophon, Chius,  "_Repetitia est mater studiorum_," said 

Sobol, hastening to drink off another wineglassful. "Would you believe it, the joy of seeing good 

people has driven away my sleepiness? I have turned into a peasant, a savage in the wilds; I've 

grown coarse, but I am still an educated man, and I tell you in good earnest, it's tedious without 

company."  They served first for a cold course white sucking-pig with horse-radish cream, then a 

rich and very hot cabbage soup with pork on it, with boiled buckwheat, from which rose a column 

of steam. The doctor went on talking, and I was soon convinced that he was a weak, unfortunate 

man, disorderly in external life. Three glasses of vodka made him drunk; he grew unnaturally 

lively, ate a great deal, kept clearing his throat and smacking his lips, and already addressed me in 

Italian, "Eccellenza." Looking naively at me as though he were convinced that I was very glad to 

see and hear him, he informed me that he had long been separated from his wife and gave her 

three-quarters of his salary; that she lived in the town with his children, a boy and a girl, whom he 



adored; that he loved another woman, a widow, well educated, with an estate in the country, but 

was rarely able to see her, as he was busy with his work from morning till night and had not a free 

moment.  "The whole day long, first at the hospital, then on my rounds," he told us; "and I assure 

you, Eccellenza, I have not time to read a book, let alone going to see the woman I love. I've read 

nothing for ten years! For ten years, Eccellenza. As for the financial side of the question, ask Ivan 

Ivanitch: I have often no money to buy tobacco."  "On the other hand, you have the moral 

satisfaction of your work," I said.  "What?" he asked, and he winked. "No," he said, "better let us 

drink."  I listened to the doctor, and, after my invariable habit, tried to take his measure by my 

usual classification--materialist, idealist, filthy lucre, gregarious instincts, and so on; but no 

classification fitted him even approximately; and strange to say, while I simply listened and looked 

at him, he seemed perfectly clear to me as a person, but as soon as I began trying to classify him 

he became an exceptionally complex, intricate, and incomprehensible character in spite of all his 

candour and simplicity. "Is that man," I asked myself, "capable of wasting other people's money, 

abusing their confidence, being disposed to sponge on them?" And now this question, which had 

once seemed to me grave and important, struck me as crude, petty, and coarse.  Pie was served; 

then, I remember, with long intervals between, during which we drank home-made liquors, they 

gave us a stew of pigeons, some dish of giblets, roast sucking-pig, partridges, cauliflower, curd 

dumplings, curd cheese and milk, jelly, and finally pancakes and jam. At first I ate with great relish, 

especially the cabbage soup and the buckwheat, but afterwards I munched and

This Melite, on account of the arrogance of its citizens, was destroyed by the other cities in a war 

declared by general agreement, and in its place, through the kindness of King Attalus and Arsinoe, 

the city of the Smyrnaeans was admitted among the Ionians.  5. Now these cities, after driving out 

the Carians and Lelegans, called that part of the world Ionia from their leader Ion, and there they 

set off precincts for the immortal gods and began to build fanes: first of all, a temple to Panionion 

Apollo such as they had seen in Achaea, calling it Doric because they had first seen that kind of 

temple built in the states of the Dorians.  6. Wishing to set up columns in that temple, but not 

having helplessly and unconscious of the taste of anything. My face was burning from the hot 

cabbage soup and the heat of the room. Ivan Ivanitch and Sobol, too, were crimson.  "To the 

health of your wife," said Sobol. "She likes me. Tell her her doctor sends her his respects."  "She's 

fortunate, upon my word," sighed Ivan Ivanitch. "Though she takes no trouble, does not fuss or 

worry herself, she has become the most important person in the whole district. Almost the whole 

business is in her hands, and they all gather round her, the doctor, the District Captains, and the 

ladies. With people of the right sort that happens of itself. Yes.... The apple-tree need take no 

thought for the apple to grow on
