ollowed Mrs. Gongoly. In olden times they had been good _
fellow, had not the necessary tools for the work, and one of his light guns=
 produced no effect. Now=20

came the time for the aggageers. Away dashed Jali on his fiery mare, closel=
y followed by Abou Do=20

and Suleiman, who in a few instants were obscured in the cloud of dust rais=
ed by the retreating=20

buffaloes. As soon as I could mount my horse that had been incomprehensible=
. But he guessed at=20

the cause of the change. The prayer he had said at the entrance to the chur=
ch had been heard,=20

and this was the answer. Yes, it really was a miracle! He had not heard all=
 the stories that were=20

spread abroad about the red umbrella, and he only smiled at those that had =
come to his ears. It is=20

true he did not understand=20


_
full speed, and spurring hard, I shortly came in sight of the three aggagee=
rs, not only in the dust,=20

but actually among the rear buffaloes of the herd. Suddenly, Jali almost di=
sappeared from the=20

saddle as he leaned forward with a jerk, and seized a fine young buffalo by=
 the tail. In a moment=20

Abou Do and Suleiman sprang from their horses, and I arrived just in time t=
o assist them in=20

securing a fine little bull of about twelve hands high, whose horns were si=
x or seven inches long. A=20

pretty fight we had with the young Hercules. The Arabs stuck to him like bu=
ll-dogs, in spite of his=20

tremendous struggles, and Florian, with other men, shortly arriving, we sec=
ured him by lashing his=20

legs together with our belts until impromptu ropes could be made with mimos=
a bark. I now=20

returned to the spot where we had left my wife and the tetel. I found her s=
tanding about fifty yards=20

from the spot with a double rifle cocked, awaiting an expected charge from =
one of the buffaloes=20

that, separated from the herd, had happened to rush in her direction. Mahom=
et had been in an=20

awful fright, and was now standing secure behind his mistress. I rode throu=
gh the grass with the=20

hope of getting a shot, but the animal had disappeared. We returned to the =
dead tetel and to our=20

captive baboons; but times had changed since we had left them. One had take=
n advantage of our=20

absence, and, having bitten through his tether, he had escaped; the other h=
ad used force instead=20

of cunning, and, in attempting to tear away from confinement, had strangled=
 himself with the slip-

knot of the rope.  The aggageers now came up with the young buffalo. This w=
as a great prize, as=20

zoological specimens were much sought after at Cassala by an agent from Ita=
ly, who had given=20

contracts for a supply. My hunters, to whom I willingly gave my share in th=
e animal, left one of their=20

party with several of my people to obtain the assistance of the camel-drive=
rs, who were not far=20

distant in the rear; these were to bring the flesh of the animals, and to d=
rive the young bull on the=20

march.  We now pushed on ahead, and at 5 P.M. we arrived at the spot on the=
 margin of the=20

Settite river at which we were to encamp for some time.  In this position, =
the valley of the Settite=20

had changed its character: instead of the rugged and broken slopes on eithe=
r side of the river,=20

ascending gradually to the high table lands, the east bank of the river was=
 low, and extended, in a=20

perfect flat for about eight miles, to the foot of an abrupt range of hills=
; the base had many ages=20

ago formed the margin of the stream, which had washed this enormous mass of=
 soil towards the=20

Atbara river, to be carried by the Nile for a deposit in Lower Egypt. Durin=
g the rainy season, the=20

river overflowed its banks, and attained a width in many places of six was =
surprised at first, but=20

had not thought any more about it, and had hung it on a nail in his room, s=
o that if the owner asked=20

for it he could have it at once, though it was not really worth sixpence.  =
But the day's events were=20

not yet done. Toward evening the news spread that the wife of the miller, t=
he village nabob, had=20

been drowned in the Bjela Voda, which was very swollen from the amount of r=
ain that had fallen.=20

The unfortunate woman had crossed the stepping-stones in order to bring bac=
k her geese, which=20

had strayed to the other side. She had brought back two of them, one under =
each arm, but as she=20

was re-crossing to fetch the third, her foot slipped, and she fell into the=
 stream. In the morning=20

there had been so little water there, that a goat could have drank it all i=
n half a minute, and by=20

midday it was swollen to such an extent that the poor woman was drowned in =
it. They looked for=20

her the whole afternoon in the cellar, in the loft, everywhere they could t=
hink of, until in the evening=20

her body was taken out of the water near Lehota. There some people recogniz=
ed her, and a man=20

was sent over on horseback to tell Mihaly Gongoly of the accident. All this=
 caused great=20

excitement in the village, and the people stood about in groups, talking of=
 the event.  "Yes, God=20



takes the rich ones too," they said.  Gyoergy Klincsok came running in to t=
he priest.  "There will be=20

a grand funeral the day after to-morrow," he exclaimed.  The sacristan appe=
ared at the=20

schoolmaster's in the hope of a glass of brandy to celebrate the event.  "C=
ollect your thoughts," he=20

exclaimed, "there will be a grand funeral, and they will expect some grand =
verses."  Two days later=20

the funeral took place, and it was a long time since anything so splendid h=
ad been seen in=20

Glogova. Mr. Gongoly had sent for the priest from Lehota too, for, as he sa=
id, why should not his=20

wife have two priests to read the burial service over her. He sent all the =
way to Besztercebanya for=20

the coffin, and they took the wooden cross that was to be put at the head o=
f the grave to Kopanyik=20

to have it painted black, with the name and the date of her death in white =
letters.  There were=20

crowds of people at the funeral in spite of the bad weather, and just as th=
e priest was starting in=20

full canonicals, with all the little choir-boys in their clean surplices, i=
t began to pour again; so=20

Father Janos turned to Kvapka, the sacristan, and said:  "Run back as fast =
as you can and fetch=20

the umbrella out of my room."  Kvapka turned and stared; how was he to know=
 what an umbrella=20

was?  "Well," said Father Janos, "if you like it better, fetch the large, r=
ound piece of red linen I=20

found two days ago spread over my little sister."  "Ah, now I understand!" =
 The priest took shelter=20

in a cottage until the=20


_
rich, and, having imbibed much moisture from a periodical overflow, it gave=
 birth to thick jungles of=20

nabbuk (Rhamnus lotus), together with luxuriant grass, which being beautifu=
lly green while all=20

other leaves and herbage were parched and withered, afforded pasturage and =
shade that=20

attracted a number of wild animals. For many miles on either side the river=
 was fringed with dense=20

groves of the green nabbuk, but upon the east bank, an island had been form=
ed of about three=20

hundred acres; this was a perfect oasis of verdure, covered with large nabb=
uk trees, about thirty=20

feet high, and forming a mixture of the densest coverts, with small open gl=
ades of rich but low=20

herbage. To reach this island, upon which we were to encamp, it was necessa=
ry to cross the arm=20

of the river, that was now dry, with the exception of deep pools, in one of=
 which we perceived a=20

large bull buffalo drinking, just as we descended the hill. As this would b=
e close to the larder, I=20

stalked to within ninety yards, and fired a Reilly No. 10 into his back, as=
 his head inclined to the=20

water. For the moment he fell upon his knees, but recovering immediately, h=
e rushed up the steep=20

bank of the island, receiving my left-hand barrel between the shoulders, an=
d he disappeared in the=20

dense covert of green nabbuk on the margin. As we were to returned with the=
 umbrella, which his=20

reverence, to the great admiration of the crowd, with one sweeping movement=
 of his hand spread=20

out in such a fashion that it looked like a series of bats' wings fastened =
together. Then, taking hold=20

of the handle, he raised it so as to cover his head, and walked on with sta=
tely step, without getting=20

wet a bit; for the drops fell angrily on the strange tent spread over him, =
and, not being able to=20

touch his reverence, fell splashing on to the ground. The umbrella was the =
great attraction for all=20

the peasants at the funeral, and they exchanged many whispered remarks abou=
t the (to them)=20

strange thing.  "That's what St. Peter brought," they said.  Only the beaut=
iful verses the=20

schoolmaster had composed for the occasion distracted their attention for a=
 while, and sobs broke=20

forth as the various relations heard their names mentioned in the lines in =
which the dead woman=20

was supposed to be taking leave of them:  "Good-by, good-by, my dearest fri=
ends; Pal Lajko my=20

brother, Gyoergy Klincsok my cousin," etc.  The whole of Pal Lajko's househ=
old began to weep=20

bitterly, and Mrs. Klincsok exclaimed rapturously:  "How on earth does he m=
anage to compose=20

such beautiful lines!"  Which exclamation inspired the schoolmaster with fr=
esh courage, and,=20

raising his voice, he continued=20


_
camp within a few yards of the spot, he was close to home; therefore, havin=
g crossed the river, we=20

carefully followed the blood tracks through the jungle; but, after having p=
ushed our way for about=20

twenty paces through the dense covert, I came to the wise conclusion that i=
t was not the place for=20

following a wounded buffalo, and that we should find him dead on the next m=
orning. A few yards=20

upon our right hand dead woman's name, not forgetting a single one, and the=
re was not a dry eye=20

among them.  For some time after they had buried Mrs. Gongoly the grand doi=
ngs at the funeral=20

were still the talk of the place, and even at the funeral the old women had=
 picked out pretty Anna=20

Tyurek as the successor of Mrs. Gongoly, and felt sure it would not be long=
 before her noted=20

"mentyek" had an owner. (Every well-to-do Slovak=20
