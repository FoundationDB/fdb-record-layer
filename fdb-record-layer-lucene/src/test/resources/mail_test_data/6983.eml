=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd you know that, since last April, he has been in the=
 _
appointed Wattles as superintendent of the establishment, calling it Emlen =
Institute. Located in a=20

section where the Negroes had sufficient interest in education to support a=
 number of elementary=20

schools, this institution once had considerable influence.[3] It was remove=
d to Bucks County,=20

Pennsylvania, in 1858 and then to Warminster in the same county in 1873.  [=
Footnote 1: Howe,=20

_Ohio Historical Collections_, p. 355.]  [Footnote 2: Howe, _Ohio Historica=
l Collections_, p. 356.]=20

[Footnote 3: Wickersham, _History of Education in Pa._, p. 254.]  Another s=
chool of this type was=20

founded in the Northwest. This was the Union Literary Institute of Spartanb=
urg, Indiana. The=20

institution owes its origin to a group of bold, antislavery men who "in the=
 heat of the abolition=20

excitement"[1] stood firm for the Negro. They soon had opposition from the =
proslavery leaders=20

who impeded the progress of the institution. But thanks to the indefatigabl=
e Ebenezer Tucker, its=20

first play? Do you think that if you needed my whole fortune I would heave =
a sigh or shed a tear as=20

I gave it into your hands? But it _is_ a grief to me, beyond sighs and tear=
s, that trifles such as=20

these should occupy the heir of Pojarsky when the foot of the enemy is on t=
he soil of holy Russia.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9C_What?_=E2=80=9D cried Ivan, springing to his feet in amazement.  =
=E2=80=9CCan it be possible you have not=20

heard?=E2=80=9D asked Petrovitch, the heavy cloud of displeasure beginning =
to clear from his brow. =E2=80=9CAt=20

daybreak this morning the tidings came. They have crossed the Niemen, those=
 barbarous hosts=20

that own no God in heaven, no king on earth save that monster from the abys=
s they call Napoleon.=20

They come--in the stillness and darkness I seem to hear their footsteps acr=
oss plain, and forest,=20

and river. They come to trample down the soil of our fatherland, to water i=
t with blood, to waste our=20

fields, to burn our villages with fire, to make our wives widows, our child=
ren orphans; ay, and to do=20

yet=20


_
Institute, however, was founded to educate both races. Its charter required=
 that no distinction=20

should be made on account of race, color, rank, or religion. Accordingly, a=
lthough the student body=20

was from the beginning of the school partly white, the board of trustees re=
presented=20

denominations of both races. Accessible statistics do not show that colored=
 persons ever=20

constituted more than one-third of the students.[2] It was one of the most =
durable of the darker=20

deeds than these, deeds which I have no words to tell. The storm has been g=
athering long; and=20

now, at last, the thunder-cloud has burst upon us! My country, O God, my co=
untry!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut our=20

cause is just,=E2=80=9D said Ivan. =E2=80=9CSurely every Russian will fight=
 to the death.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThis, indeed, will be a=20

death-struggle,=E2=80=9D Petrovitch resumed. =E2=80=9CDo you not understand=
? It is all the world against holy=20

schools, having continued after the Civil War, carrying out to some extent =
the original designs of=20

its founders. As the plan to continue it as a private institution proved la=
ter to be impracticable the=20

establishment was changed into a public school.[3]  [Footnote 1: Boone, _Th=
e History of=20

Education in Indiana_, p. 77.]  [Footnote 2: According to the _Report of th=
e United States=20

Commissioner of Education_ in 1893 the colored students then constituted ab=
out one-third of=20

those then registered at this institution. See p. 1944 of this report.]  [F=
ootnote 3: Records of the=20

United States Bureau of Education.]  Scarcely less popular was the British =
and American Manual=20

Labor Institute of the colored settlements in Upper Canada. This school was=
 projected by Rev.=20

Hiram Wilson and Josiah Henson as early as 1838, but its organization was n=
ot undertaken until=20

1842. The refugees were then called together to decide upon the expenditure=
 of $1500 collected=20

in England by James C. Fuller, a Quaker. They decided to establish at Dawn =
"a manual labor=20

school, where children could be taught those elements of knowledge which ar=
e usually the=20

occupations of a grammar school, and where boys could be taught in addition=
 the practice of some=20

mechanic art, and the girls could be instructed in those domestic arts whic=
h are the proper=20

occupation and ornament of their rampart of crested foam; Spain already ble=
eding beneath the=20

talons of the vulture. Russia, Russia only, stands upright, and refuses, as=
 Pope Yefim expresses=20

it, to bow the knee to the Baal, or rather to the Moloch of France. Therefo=
re, the conqueror has=20

forced the conquered to join his standard, and it is not only the legions o=
f France who are pouring=20

across the Niemen, but Prussians, Austrians, Saxons, Westphalians, all the =
men of Germany who=20

are Napoleon=E2=80=99s subservient though unwilling slaves; Poles, ever eag=
er to trample on our pride and=20

profit by our misfortunes; ay, even Spaniards, dragged from their vines and=
 their olives to fight for=20

the tyrant they detest.=E2=80=9D He paused, then went on again in a sadder =
tone and with even deeper=20

feeling--=E2=80=9CIf in this dark hour God had but been gracious to us, and=
 given us a bearded Czar!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA=20

bearded Czar!=E2=80=9D Ivan repeated in perplexed surprise.  =E2=80=9CYes. =
Do you not remember the words of the=20

great Czar Peter? =E2=80=98If ever again a bearded Czar shall sit upon the =
throne of Russia, all Europe=20

may tremble.=E2=80=99 He meant a true Muscovite Czar--stern, hard, and stro=
ng, like Ivan the Terrible long=20

ago, somewhat like Count Rostopchine now. But instead of such a hero as the=
 Czars of old--with=20

the world in arms against us, God in his inscrutable providence has seen fi=
t to send us Alexander=20

Paulovitch.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut, d=C3=A4dushka, the=20


_
tract of three hundred acres of land was purchased, a few buildings were co=
nstructed, and pupils=20

were soon admitted. The managers endeavored to make the school, "self-suppo=
rting by the=20

employment of the students for certain portions of the time on the land."[2=
] The advantage of=20

schooling of this kind attracted to Dresden and Dawn sufficient refugees to=
 make these=20

prosperous settlements. Rev. Hiram Wilson, the first principal of the insti=
tution, began with=20

 Russia are not wood or stone.=20

They love him well enough to be true to him to the death, if only he dares =
to be true to himself and=20

to them. But that is too much to hope. All things must do after their kind.=
