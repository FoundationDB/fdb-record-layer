OR  But no joyfully galumphing William appeared to welcome him.  He had no =
intention of ringing=20

to inquire. No, he'd take a good look round first, before he went back to h=
ang about outside the=20

church.  It was pleasant in the Wren's End garden.  Presently he went down =
the broad central path=20

of the walled garden, with borders of flowers and beds of vegetables. Half-=
way down, in the=20

sunniest, warmest place, he came upon a hammock slung between an apple-tree=
 not quite out=20

and a pear-tree that was nearly over, and a voice from the hammock called s=
leepily: "Is that you,=20

Earley? I wish you'd pick up my cigarette case for me; it's fallen into the=
 lavender bush just below."=20



"Yes, Miss," a voice answered that was certainly not Earley's.  Meg leaned =
out of the hammock to=20

look behind her.  "Hullo!" she said. "Why are you not in church? I can't ge=
t up because I'm a=20

prisoner on _parole_. Short of a thunderstorm nothing is to move me from th=
is hammock till Miss=20

Ross comes back."  Miles stood in the pathway looking down at the muffled f=
igure in the=20

hammock. There was little to be seen of Meg save her rumpled, hatless head.=
 She was much too=20

economical of her precious caps to waste one in a hammock. She had slept fo=
r nearly two hours,=20

then Hannah roused her with a cup of soup. She was drowsy and warm and comf=
ortable, and her=20

usually pale cheeks were almost as pink as the apple-blossom buds above her=
 head.  "Do you=20

want to sleep? Or may I stop and talk to you a bit?" Miles asked, when he h=
ad found the=20

somewhat battered cigarette case and restored it to her.  "As I'm very plai=
nly off duty, I suppose=20

you may stay and talk--if I fall asleep in the middle you must not be offen=
ded. You'll find plenty of=20

chairs in the tool house."  When Miles returned Meg had lit her cigarette, =
and he begged a light=20

from her.  What little hands she had! How fine-grained and delicate her ski=
n!  Again he felt that=20

queer lump in his throat at the absurd, sweet pathos of her.  He placed his=
 chair where he had her=20

full in view, not too near, yet comfortably so for conversation. Jan had sw=
ung the hammock very=20

high, and Meg looked down at Miles over the edge.  "It is unusual," she sai=
d, "to find a competent=20

nurse spending her morning in this fashion, but if you know Miss Ross at al=
l, you will already have=20

realised that under her placid exterior she has a will of iron."  "I should=
n't say _you_ were lacking=20

in determination."  "Oh, I'm nothing to Jan. _She_ exerts physical force. L=
ook at me perched up=20

here! How can I get down without a bad fall, swathed like a mummy in wraps;=
 while my employer=20

does my work?"  "But you don't want to get down. You look awfully comfortab=
le."  "I am awfully=20

comfortable--but it's most ... unprofessional--please don't tell anybody el=
se."  Meg closed her eyes,=20

looking rather like a sleepy kitten, and Miles watched her in silence with =
a pain at his heart.=20

Something kept saying over and over again: "Six years ago that girl there r=
an off with Walter=20

Brooke. Six years ago that apparently level-headed, sensible little person =
was dazzled by the=20

pinchbeck graces of that epicure in sensations." Miles fully granted his ch=
arm, his gentle=20

melancholy, his caressing manner; but with=20

cognise these things=20

intuitively.  Miles looked very sad and grave, and Meg, suddenly opening he=
r eyes, found him=20

but he's nowhere to be seen."  "He's with Jan and the children. I think"--h=

 Little Fay roars the=20

from his mind.=20

"Perhaps," he said, and paused, "you will by and by allow to William's late=

of that regard?"  "If William's master on further acquaintance proves half =
