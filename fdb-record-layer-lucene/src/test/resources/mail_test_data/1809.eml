dracaena marginata another source."  "Will you tell police?" Dan questioned=
.  "Yes, Dan. This clue may be the most important one yet. I've begun to th=
ink though, that the money never will be recovered. In that case, if the ri=

 in his arms and carried her out to his sledge and tucked her under the bla=

took the front seat. Pavel drove. The party set out with dracaena marginata=

he lost the money. I'd have told him about it, only it didn't register on m=
e until yesterday that there=20

might be any connection."  "So far as I know no one lives at the Hatfield h=
ouse except Sam, his=20

wife, and Fred," Dan said, deeply puzzled. "Who could the old lady have bee=
n?"  "It was no one I=20

knew. She kept the shawl over her head, either to hide her face or protect =
it from the cold air."=20

"Which way did she go?" Dan asked.  "I didn't notice. As I say, at the time=
 I thought nothing about=20

seeing her."  "I think Mr. Hatfield should know about this, and maybe the p=
olice," said Dan. "So far,=20

the only clue found is a black jet button. Apparently, it came from a woman=
's dress. But how could=20

a woman have known about the box?"  The milkman did not try to answer. Alre=
ady late on his=20

route, he started toward his wagon.  "I won't get a chance to talk to Mr. H=
atfield until late tonight,"=20

he called over his shoulder. "If you think what I told you means anything, =
Dan, let him know for=20

me."  "I'll do it right away," the boy promised.  Even before the milk wago=
n was out of sight, he had=20

gathered up his materials.  "Mom, how about rushing breakfast?" he asked, c=
arrying both the milk=20

and his work into the kitchen. "I want to see Mr. Hatfield before I go to s=
chool."  "I'll set the food=20

right on," his mother promised.  Dan ate on the fly. "Don't look for me aft=
er school tonight," he=20

advised as he banged out the door. "The Cubs are having a cook-out."  At th=
e Hatfield home, Dan=20

found the Cub leader, his wife, and Fred eating their own breakfast.  "Have=
 a roll and some=20

chocolate with us," Mrs. Hatfield invited.  "I've had my breakfast," Dan re=
plied, eyeing the sugary=20

hot roll with a greedy eye.  "Oh, a growing boy always can eat a little mor=
e," Mrs. Hatfield laughed,=20

offering him a chair. "Do have something with us, Dan."  Thus urged, the bo=
y slid into the seat by=20

the window. As he sipped hot chocolate, he told Mr. Hatfield what the milkm=
an had reported.  "An=20

elderly woman in black!" Mrs. Hatfield exclaimed. "I can't imagine!"  "You'=
ve had no cleaning=20

woman?" asked Dan.  "Not in weeks, Dan. And no visitors at such an early ho=
ur of the morning."=20

"I locked all the doors that night we brought the box here," Mr. Hatfield s=
aid slowly.  "The one=20

opening into the cellar?" his wife asked him.  "Well--I'm not sure."  "Whic=
h means you didn't," Mrs.=20

Hatfield said. "Oh, Sam, you old misery. Peter listened, but did not stir. =
He was sitting on the floor=20

by the kitchen stove. The coyotes broke out again; yap, yap, yap--then the =
high whine. Pavel=20

called for something and struggled up on his elbow.  "He is scared of the w=
olves," Antonia=20

whispered to me. "In his country there are very many, and they eat men and =
women." We slid=20

closer together along the bench.  I could not take my eyes off the man in t=
he bed. His shirt was=20

hanging open, and his emaciated chest, covered with yellow bristle, rose an=
d fell horribly. He=20

began to cough. Peter shuffled to his feet, caught up the tea-kettle and mi=
xed him some hot water=20

and whiskey. The sharp smell of spirits went through the room.  Pavel snatc=
hed the cup and=20

drank, then made Peter give him the bottle and slipped it under his pillow,=
 grinning disagreeably,=20

as if he had outwitted some one. His eyes followed Peter about the room wit=
h a contemptuous,=20

unfriendly expression. It seemed to me that he despised him for being so si=
mple and docile.=20

Presently Pavel began to talk to Mr. Shimerda, scarcely above a whisper. He=
 was telling a long=20

story, and as he went on, Antonia took my hand under the table and held it =
tight. She leaned=20

forward and strained her ears to hear him. He grew more and more excited, a=
nd kept pointing all=20

around his bed, as if there were things there and he wanted Mr. Shimerda to=
 see them.  "It's=20

wolves, Jimmy," Antonia whispered. "It's awful, what he says!"  The sick ma=
n raged and shook his=20

fist. He seemed to be cursing people who had wronged him. Mr. Shimerda caug=
ht him by the=20

shoulders, but could hardly hold him in bed. At last he was shut off by a c=
oughing fit which fairly=20



choked him. He pulled a cloth from under his pillow and held it to his mout=
h. Quickly it was=20

covered with bright red spots--I thought I had never seen any blood so brig=
ht. When he lay down=20

and turned his face to the wall, all the rage had gone out of him. He lay p=
atiently fighting for=20

breath, like a child with croup. Antonia's father uncovered one of his long=
 bony legs and rubbed it=20

rhythmically. From our bench we could see what a hollow case his body was. =
His spine and=20

shoulder-blades stood out like the bones under the hide of a dead steer lef=
t in the fields. That=20

sharp backbone must have hurt him when he lay on it.  Gradually, relief cam=
e to all of us.=20

Whatever it was, the worst was over. Mr. Shimerda=20


_
careless."  "I'm afraid so," the Cub leader admitted. "After all the preach=
ing I've done to the Cubs=20

too."  "It wasn't your fault," Dan said loyally. "Until lately, it's never =
been necessary to lock a house=20

up tight to keep one's belongings safe."  "This always has been a good neig=
hborhood," Mr.=20

Hatfield agreed. "That fact gave me a false sense of security, I'm afraid."=
  "If the milkman saw a=20

woman leaving the house, that's obviously where the money box went," Mrs. H=
atfield declared,=20

refilling Dan's cup with chocolate. "It explains too why the police found a=
 jet button near where the=20

box had been hidden."  "But who could the woman have been?" Mr. Hatfield mu=
rmured. "So far as=20

we know, the only person besides the Cubs who knew up and lit his lantern. =
He was going out to=20

get his team to drive us home. Mr. Shimerda went with him. We sat and watch=
ed the long bowed=20

en we were lying in=20

the straw, under the jolting and rattling Antonia told me as much of the st=
ory as she could. What=20

she did not tell me then, she told later; we talked of nothing else for day=
s afterward.    When Pavel=20

and Peter were young men, living at home in Russia, they were asked to be g=
roomsmen for a=20

friend who was to marry the belle of another village. It was in the dead of=
 winter and the groom's=20

party went over to the wedding in sledges. Peter and Pavel drove in the gro=
om's sledge, and six=20

ield reasoned. "We=20

can be fairly certain of that because so many claims were put in for the mo=
ney."  "Learning about=20

this woman convinces me of one thing," said Mr. Hatfield. "I'm  After the c=
eremony at the church,=20
