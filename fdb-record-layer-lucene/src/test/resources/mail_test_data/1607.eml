 the portion of real=20

freedom which a people can enjoy.     CONCLUSION  Such was the outline of t=

informed, will, he hopes, think so, the opinion of others is indifferent to=

Effort is also made to connect earthquakes and volcanoes with the gigantic =
convulsions of the sun,=20

known as =E2=80=9Csun spots.=E2=80=9D It is argued by certain advocates of =
the molten interior that the attraction of=20

the sun and moon produces an interior tidal wave, like that of the sea; and=
 any irregularities in this=20

produce the phenomena of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Objections to =
the molten interior=20

have been already noted; and in regard to the other suggestions, so long as=
 the great convulsions=20

are peculiarly prevalent in certain regions, so long it will be necessary t=
o seek their chief cause or=20

most powerful modifiers in entirely local influences.  In conclusion, it do=
es not yet seem clear that=20

we can rely absolutely upon a single cause as productive of all the convuls=
ions of the earth=E2=80=99s crust.=20

Who indeed can but reflect with pain, that while the torch of seems almost =
imperative to many men=20

to admit, at least, the modifying influence of other agencies. But so long =
as these agencies appear=20

to be quite as frequently the modified as the modifier, no laws concerning =
them can be=20
