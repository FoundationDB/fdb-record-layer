however the subjects may its details. The Interior of St. Peter's is by M. =
Bouton. The point of view=20

is at the east entry, opposite to the choir; the reader, perhaps, not being=
 aware that the choir in=20

this cathedral is situated differently from all others, being at the west e=
nd. So beautiful are the=20

proportions of the cathedral itself, that its vastness does not strike at f=
irst sight, and this effect is=20

admirably preserved in the Diorama. We think we could point out a few inacc=
uracies in the=20

drawing; but the projections, capitals of the columns, and some of the meda=
llion portraits which=20

ornament them, are so well painted, that we can scarcely believe ourselves =
looking on a flat=20

surface. Again, the emmet-like figures of the distant congregation are admi=
rable illustrations of the=20

vastness of the building; and above all, the flood of light shed from the l=
antern of the dome is a=20

perfect triumph of art.  The other view is the French Village of Thiers in =
the department of the Puy=20

de Doue, on the bank of the little River Durolle, which is actually made to=
 flow, or rather trickle=20

over large stones; whilst smoke ascends from the chimney of an adjoining co=
ttage. As a romantic=20

picture of still life, its merits can scarcely be too highly spoken of, and=
 when we say it is quite equal=20

to _Unterseen_, by the same artist, and engraved in our last volume, we hop=

region. Their course=20

 pursued, and a little after=20

sunset they arrived at a farm-house, which the corporal informed his captai=

quarter of Theodora for the night, as the horses could proceed no farther w=
ithout rest. At dawn=20

they were to resume their way, and soon to cross the open country, where da=

be anticipated.  The farmer was frightened when he was summoned from his ho=
use by a party of=20

armed men; but having some good ducats given him in advance, and being assu=
red they were all=20

Christians, he took heart and labored to do what they desired. Theodora dul=
y found herself in=20

becoming quarters, and a sentry was mounted at her residence. The troopers,=
 who had been quite=20
