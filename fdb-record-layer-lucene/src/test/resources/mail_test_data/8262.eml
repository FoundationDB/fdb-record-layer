reads like a long sigh of relief at escape from a danger just past; its bur=
den is to tell of God's=20

deliverance, and to urge to trust in Him. How perfectly this tone correspon=
ds to the circumstances=20

immediately after his escape from Gath to Adullam need not be more than poi=
nted out. The=20

dangers which he had dreaded and the cry to God which he had sent forth are=
 still present to his=20

mind, and echo through his song, like a subtly-touched chord of sadness, wh=
ich appears for a=20

moment, and is drowned in the waves of some triumphant music.    "I sought =
the Lord, and He=20

heard me,    And from all my alarms He delivered me.         *       *     =
  *       *       *    This afflicted=20

(man) cried, and Jehovah heard,   And from all his troubles He saved him." =
 And the "local=20

colouring" of the psalm corresponds too with the circumstances of Adullam. =
How appropriate, for=20

instance, does the form in which the Divine protection is proclaimed become=
, when we think of the=20

little band bivouacking among the cliffs, "The angel of the Lord encampeth =
round about them that=20

fear Him, and delivereth them." Like his great ancestor, he is met in his d=
esert flight by heavenly=20

guards, "and he calls the name of that place Mahanaim" (that is, "two camps=
"), as discerning=20

gathered round his own feeble company the ethereal weapons of an encircling=
 host of the warriors=20

of God, through whose impenetrable ranks his foes must pierce before they c=
an reach him. From=20

Samson's time we read of lions in this district (Judges xiv. 8, 9), and we =
may recognise another=20

image as suggested by their growls heard among the ravines, and their gaunt=
 forms prowling near=20

the cave. "The young lions do lack and suffer hunger; but they that seek th=
e Lord shall not want=20

any good" (ver. 10).  And then he passes to earnest instructions and exhort=
ations, which derive=20

appositeness from regarding them as a proclamation to his men of the princi=
ples on which his=20

camp is to be governed. "Come, ye children, hearken unto me." He regards hi=
mself as charged=20

with guiding them to godliness: "I will teach you the fear of the Lord." Wi=
th some remembrance,=20

perhaps, of his deception at Gath, he warns them to "keep" their "tongues f=
rom evil" and their "lips=20

from speaking guile." They are not to be in love with warfare, but, even wi=
th their swords in their=20

hands, are to "seek peace, and pursue it." On these exhortations follow joy=
ous assurances of=20

God's watchful eye fixed upon the righteous, and His ear open to their cry;=
 of deliverance for his=20

suppliants, whatsoever hardship and trouble they may have to wade through; =
of a guardianship=20

which "keepeth all the bones" of the righteous, so that neither the blows o=
f the foe nor the perils of=20

the crags should break them,--all crowned with the contrast ever present to=
 David's mind, and=20

having a personal reference to his enemies and to himself:    "Evil shall s=
lay the wicked,    And the=20

haters of the righteous shall suffer penalty.    Jehovah redeems the life o=
f His servants,    And no=20

penalty shall any suffer who trust in Him."  Such were the counsels and tea=
chings of the young=20

leader to his little band,--noble "general orders" from a commander at the =
beginning of a=20

campaign!  We venture to refer the twenty-seventh psalm also to this period=
. It is generally=20

supposed, indeed, by those commentators who admit its Davidic authorship, t=
o belong to the time=20

of Absalom's rebellion. The main reason for throwing it so late is the refe=
rence in ver. 4 to dwelling=20

in the house of the Lord and inquiring in His temple.[J] This is supposed t=
o require a date=20

subsequent to David's bringing up of the ark to Jerusalem, and placing it i=
n a temporary sanctuary.=20

But whilst longing for the sanctuary is no doubt characteristic of the psal=
ms of the later=20

wanderings, it is by no means necessary to suppose that in the present case=
 that desire, which=20

David represents as the longing of his life, was a desire for mere bodily p=
resence in a material=20

temple. Indeed, the very language seems to forbid such an interpretation. S=
urely the desire for an=20



abode in the house of the Lord--which was his one wish, which he longed to =
have continuous=20

throughout all the days of his life, which was to surround him with a priva=
cy of protection in trouble,=20

and to be as the munitions of rocks about him--was something else than a mo=
rbid desire for an=20

impossible seclusion in the tabernacle,--a desire fitter for some sickly me=
diaeval monarch who=20

buried his foolish head and faint heart in a monastery than for God's Anoin=
ted. We have seen an=20

earlier germ of the same desire in the twenty-third psalm, the words of whi=
ch are referred to here;=20

and the interpretation of the one is the interpretation of the other. The p=
salmist breathes his=20

longing for the Divine fellowship, which shall be at once vision, and guida=
nce, and hidden life in=20

distress, and stability, and victory, and shall break into music of perpetu=
al praise.  [J] "The fourth=20

verse in its present form _must_ have been written after the temple was bui=
lt."--"The Psalms=20

chronologically arranged," p. 68--following Ewald, in whose imperious criti=
cism that same naked=20

"must have been," works wonders.  If, then, we are not obliged by the words=
 in question to adopt=20

the later date, there is much in the psalm which strikingly corresponds wit=
h the earlier, and throws=20

beautiful illustration on the psalmist's mood at this period. One such allu=
sion we venture to=20

suppose in the words (ver. 2),    "When the wicked came against me to devou=
r my flesh,    My=20

enemies and my foes,--they stumbled and fell;"  which have been usually tak=
en as a mere general=20

expression, without any allusion to a specific event. But there was one inc=
ident in David's life=20

which had been forced upon his remembrance by his recent peril at Gath--his=
 duel with Goliath,=20

which exactly meets the very peculiar language could bear; they swallowed i=
t, however, with tea=20

and ices, which were handed round, but I got so worked up at last by a smoo=
th-faced man who=20

was describing what he had gone through for the sake of the heathen, while =
he was living=20

luxuriously in one of the most charming little mission establishments which=
 I have ever visited, that=20

I made the following remarks:--  "Ladies and Gentlemen,--When I came here t=
his evening nothing=20

was farther from my purpose than to address you. I cannot allow, however, t=
he remarks of the=20

Bishop of the Caribbee Islands, of Mr Chundango, or of the Rev. Mr Beevy, t=
o pass unnoticed.=20

"The Bishop of the Caribbee Islands, in the course of the very graphic acco=
unt which he has given=20

you of the progress of conversion in his diocese, and of the number of inte=
resting and instructive=20

deathbeds which he has witnessed, has entered into a calculation by which i=
t would appear that=20

the average cost of the conversion of a human soul in those islands is a li=
ttle over L6. Ladies, you=20

pretend to believe that, but you don't. It would be impossible for you to s=
it there with strings of lost=20

human souls round your necks, and what would keep an infant school in each =
ear, if you really=20

believed that you could save a soul for L6. You come here and listen to gen=
tlemen who give you=20

an account of the sacrifices they make for the heathen, and of results whic=
h do not look so well on=20

the spot as on paper; and because you throw a pound into that vase in the p=
resence of the=20

company, you think that you have done something for them too. 'They may giv=
e up all,' you say,=20

'but we can't afford to save more than two or three souls per annum.'  "Lad=
ies and gentlemen, as=20

far as my experience goes, you neither of you as a rule give up anything fo=
r the heathen. I cannot,=20

therefore, share in your wonder at the barren results of your missionary ef=
forts. The Tabernacle=20

Missionary Society, for instance, offers to a young man of the lower middle=
s" (Mr Beevy's father=20

was a butcher, so I did not like to enter more fully into this part of the =
subject) "the opportunity of=20

becoming a reverend and a gentleman, and thus advancing a step in society. =
It gives him L300 a-

year to begin with, L80 a-year more with his wife, L20 a-year with his firs=
t child, and L10 a-year=20



with each succeeding olive-branch. It educates these free of expense at Hol=
loway, and it pays an=20

indefinite number of passages between England and the 'mission-field,' acco=
rding as the health of=20

the family requires it; and permit me to say that, if to receive between L4=
00 and L500 a-year in a=20

tolerable climate, with a comfortable house rent-free, and the prospect of =
a pension at the end, is=20

to give up all for the heathen, I have myself made the experiment without p=
ersonal discomfort.=20

Perhaps I speak with a certain feeling of bitterness on this subject, for I=
 cannot forget that upon=20

one occasion while residing among the heathen, a gentleman who is now prese=
nt, and who had=20

sacrificed his all for them, outbid me for a horse at an auction after I ha=
d run him up to sixty=20

guineas. With such a magnificent institution as this for supplying 'purse' =
and 'scrip,' and for 'taking=20

thought for the morrow' in the way of pensions, &c., tell me honestly wheth=
er you think you=20

deserve real, not nominal conversions? You have instituted a sort of 'civil=
 service,' with which 'you=20

compass sea and land to make one proselyte.' You go to him with a number of=
 bibles, Armstrong=20

guns, drunken sailors, and unscrupulous traders, a combination which goes t=
o make up what you=20

call 'civilisation,' and you wonder that your converts are actuated by the =
same motive which my=20

own Hindoo servant once told me induced him to leave his own religion, in w=
hich he could not=20

venture to get drunk, and become a Christian.  "Do you think it is the faul=
t of the religion that you=20

don't make converts, or the fault of the system under which it is propagate=
d? If you gave up 'the=20

enticing words of man's wisdom,' and tried a little of 'the demonstration o=
f the spirit and of power,'=20

don't you think the result would be different? If you are only illumined by=
 'a dim religious light'=20

yourselves, how do you expect to dissipate the gross darkness of paganism? =
You have only got=20

an imitation blaze that warms nobody at home, and you wonder when you take =
it abroad that it=20

leaves everybody as cold and as dead as it finds them.  "My dear Christian =
friends, in the face of=20

the living contradiction which we all present in our conduct to the religio=
n we profess, our=20

missionaries can only convince the heathen of the truth of Christianity by =
living the life upon which=20

that religion is based, by means of which it can alone be powerful, and whi=
ch is only now not lived=20

by Christians, because, as was prophesied, there is no 'faith on the earth.=
' I have spoken to you=20

faithfully, even harshly, but, believe me, I have done so in a spirit of lo=
ve. If you can take it in the=20

same spirit, I shall feel I have done you a great injustice."  I was so exc=
ited while delivering myself=20

of these observations that I was quite unconscious of the effect I was prod=
ucing. I remember there=20

was a deathlike silence, and that when I sat down the gentlemen behind the =
table looked flushed=20

and agitated. Mr Beevy first rose to reply to observations which, he said, =
reflected upon him=20

personally, no less than upon the society to which he was proud to say he b=
elonged. He then=20

explained the circumstances under which he had been induced to give L65 for=
 the horse; and=20

retaliated upon me in language which I will spare my readers now, as they w=
ill see it in the=20

'Discord,' when that organ of the "worldly-holies" does me the honour to re=
view this veracious=20

history. The religious world has a more choice catalogue of epithets for th=
eir enemies than any=20

other section of the community. I need not therefore suggest=20


_
tells how the Philistine "arose, and came, and drew near to David." The bra=
ggart boast, "I will give=20

thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and the beasts of the fields," is echoe=
d in the singular phrase of=20

the psalm; and the emphatic, rapid picture, "they stumbled and fell," is at=
 once a reminiscence of=20

the hour when the stone crashed through the thick forehead, "and he fell up=
on his face to the=20

earth;" and also a reference to an earlier triumph in Israel's history, cel=
ebrated with fierce=20

exultation in the wild chant whom rolls the words like a sweet morsel under=
 the tongue, as it tells of=20

Sisera--    "Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay;    Between her fee=
t he bowed, he fell;=20

Where he bowed, there he fell down dead."  Another autobiographical referen=
ce in the psalm has=20

been disputed on insufficient grounds:    "For my father and my mother fors=
ake me,    And=20

Jehovah takes me up." (Ver. 10.)  It is, at all events, a remarkable coinci=
dence that the only=20

mention of his parents after the earliest chapters of his life falls in pre=
cisely with this period of the=20

history, and is such as might have suggested these words. We read (1 Sam. x=
xii. 3, 4) that he=20

once ventured all the way from Adullam to Moab to beg an asylum from Saul's=
 indiscriminate fury=20

for his father was the term applied to me by the amateur lay-preacher after=
 Mr Beevy sat down.=20

Finally, the proceedings terminated in some confusion; before they did, how=
ever, I rose again to=20

point out how completely the conduct of those present had proved my case--e=
ither the faults to=20

which I alluded existed, and there was nothing more to be said; or I had bu=
ffeted them without=20

cause, and they had _not_ "taken it patiently," a course of conduct quite i=
nexcusable in a meeting=20

composed exclusively of dear Christian friends. If there is a thing I yearn=
 for, it is the love of my=20

fellow-men. By making the "worldly-holies" consider me an enemy, I ought to=
 secure an unusual=20

share of their affection. Remember, now, if you abuse me for this, it is un=
christian; if you leave me=20

alone, you will be treating me "with the contempt I deserve," and that is u=
nchristian too; the right=20

thing for you to do is to take the charitable view, to admit that my motive=
s may be good, even if the=20

means employed are injudicious. When I am abruptly asked in an omnibus, by =
an entire stranger,=20

who may happen to belong to the "straitest sect," the most solemn question =
which one man can=20

put to another, I do not resent it. I believe he is sincerely trying to "aw=
aken me" with a "word in=20

season." I question the=20


_
perils, as the rest of his family did. Having prepared a kindly welcome for=
 them, perhaps on the=20

strength of the blood of Ruth the Moabitess in Jesse's veins, he returned t=
o Bethlehem, brought=20

the old couple away, and guarded them safely to their refuge. It is surely =
most natural to friends.=20

We are all bad, and I am far worse than any of you; but still I may show ho=
w bad the best of us=20

are. By living in a fool's paradise here, we shall not qualify ourselves fo=
r the other one to come.=20

Depend upon it, we are all a great deal too comfortable to be safe.  "Lord =
Frank,"=20
