And sadder things than these!                               MRS. HEMANS  Sw=
eet romantic Cove of=20

Torwich--repository of my youth's recollections!--A mingled gust of feeling=
 crosses over me,=20

rainbow-like,--fraught with the checkered remembrances of "life's eventful =
history," when I turn to=20

the past, and glance over the scenes of my early life.  The Bay of Torwich,=
 on the southern coast,=20

unites in its fullest extent the singularly wild and picturesque, with the =
softer features of the=20

landscape. The bay consists of two headlands, about four miles apart. On th=
e eastern side a lofty=20

range of rocky heights extends for a considerable way, almost equalling tho=
se of Dovor in=20

sublimity, and juts out into the sea, on the assaults of which they seem to=
 frown defiance,=20

terminating in a bold headland. The violence of the sea has caused extensiv=
e and picturesque=20

excavations and caverns; and at the end of the cliff, two sharp rocks calle=
d the Needles, raised=20

their heads at low water, connected by a low, sunken reef. In a westerly ga=
le these rocks were=20

very dangerous to homeward-bound ships, and I have often sat with admiratio=
n in the heights=20

above, watching the grotesque forms and silvery spray of the gigantic break=
ers, which after being=20

broken in their progress, heaved their expiring rage with a shock like thun=
der, against the base of=20

the cliffs, causing a prolonged echo in the huge caverns above. About midwa=
y between these cliffs=20

and the western side there was another lofty headland, which terminated the=
 Cove of Torwich; as=20

the sea, except at low-water in high spring tides, washed the foot of this =
promontory, it was only=20

fordable at ebb-tide. In the middle of the intermediate space, three rocks =
which might truly be=20

called "forked promontories" from their sharp pyramidical shape, jutted abr=
uptly out of the beach,=20

and were connected by a sort of natural causeway to the main land. Beyond, =
a wild and rocky=20

valley ran inland, and the time-worn ruins of ---- Castle, beetling over th=
e heights, terminated the=20

view in this direction. This valley formed the bed of a small stream, which=
 ran by the end of the=20

rocks, composing a channel by which coasting vessels could run up and disch=
arge their cargoes=20

for the village of Torwich, only part of which was visible at this spot. A =
natural cleft in the vein=20

opened through the centre of these singular rocks, resembling a lofty gothi=
c arch, and it was my=20

favourite pastime to sit here in the most perfect seclusion, reading "sermo=
ns in stones" and=20

watching the progress of the tide till it kissed my feet, and often surroun=
ded me, for the flood came=20

in with great velocity. Between these rocks and the heights on the eastern =
side, there was another=20

little retired creek, renowned in the village annals, for the adventures of=
 Jack Covering, a noted=20

smuggler on this coast, some forty years ago, with the locality of which th=
e reader will erewhile=20

become better acquainted. The magnificence of the convulsed scenery, and ya=
wning chasms=20

around, the deep intonation and ceaseless roar of the ocean, all combined t=
o awaken in the mind=20

of the spectator, mingled sensations of admiration and awe.  The coast rece=
ded between the=20

eastern point of the cove to that which terminated the Bay of Torwich, embr=
acing what may be=20

almost termed a champaign country, compared with the barren scenery I have =
described; and=20

displaying the uneven surface of the richly wooded Park of Dovedale, with t=
he ruins of two castles.=20

The village of Torwich which stood on a declivity, with an opening descent =
to the shore, about half=20

a mile from the entrance of the cove, had little communication, from the na=
ture of its site, with the=20

neighbouring country, except when the all-powerful attraction of a wreck ex=
isted. Its inhabitants=20

were chiefly sailors or fishermen, barring a few useless individuals like m=
yself. I loved to study life=20

in all its gradations--the "March of Intellect" was yet unknown here! and t=
hough the situation=20

afforded such numerous advantages for smuggling, there were, rather unaccou=
ntably, only three=20



persons in the village connected with the coast blockade; and it was whispe=
red that relying on the=20

entire seclusion of the cove, these persons too often winked when they ough=
t to have been astir=20

on their duty.  The day was far spent, when towards the close of the month =
of October, 18--, I=20

wandered out to the shore to watch the flow of the evening's tide. The weat=
her had been unsettled=20

for some time previous, and the rain had fallen in torrents, with a moderat=
e breeze, during most=20

part of the day. Towards evening the rain ceased, though large heavy masses=
 of black clouds=20

were flying about, and backing up to seaward, accompanied with a short gust=
y gale of wind. I=20

never recollect a more dismal night. A thick haze overspread the lower part=
s of the landscape,=20

throwing the bloated masses of clouds higher up in the horizon, into a sort=
 of sombre relief. As I=20

passed a little look-out house on my way to the beach, I sauntered to a gro=
up of sailors at their=20

usual council, who were gazing with deep interest at a solitary vessel diml=
y discernible through the=20

fog in the offing. As she neared us we found her to be a barque of apparent=
ly considerable=20

burthen, making a tack to weather the Torhead, which lay several miles unde=
r her lee, with a=20

strong breeze from windward. She was evidently quite out of her reckoning f=
rom the indecision=20

and embarassment displayed in her movements; and the captain seemed not suf=
ficiently aware of=20

the hazard he ran. I waited sometime at this place watching the movements o=
f the ship. The tide=20

came roaring in with a broken swell increased by a high spring flood; and t=
here was that in the=20

"wind's eye" which betokened approaching disaster; while the gloom was incr=
easing, and the=20

harsh cries and hurried flight of the sea-birds indicated tempestuous weath=
er.  "An ugly looking=20

night this, Mr. ---- as I have seen for many a-day," remarked Harry Coverin=
g, one of the oldest of=20

the group of sailors, and a crony of mine. "Sink the Customs! if yon ship w=
eathers Torhead this=20

night, may I never pull an oar again." "It is, indeed, a fearful-looking ni=
ght, messmate, and no time=20

ought to be lost in the present state of the tide intellect or the loudness=
 of his lungs; once the land=20

of saints and scholars, and people in pious pilgrimages, and finding always=
 solace and support in=20

the divine offices of an ever-present Church, which were a true though a fa=
int type of the beautiful=20

future that awaited man. Why, only three centuries of this rebellion agains=
t the Most High have=20

produced throughout the world, on the subject the most important that man s=
hould possess a=20

clear, firm faith, an anarchy of opinion, throwing out every monstrous and =
fantastic form, from a=20

caricature of the Greek philosophy to a revival of fetichism.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CIt is a chaos,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, with a=20

sigh.  =E2=80=9CFrom which I wish to save you,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal, =
with some eagerness. =E2=80=9CThis is not a time=20

to hesitate. You must be for God, or for Antichrist. The Church calls upon =
her children.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am not=20

unfaithful to the Church,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cwhich was the Chu=
rch of my fathers.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe Church of=20

England,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal. =E2=80=9CIt was mine. I think of it ev=
er with tenderness and pity. Parliament=20

made the Church of England, and Parliament will unmake the Church of Englan=
d. The Church of=20

England is not the Church of the English. Its fate is sealed. It will soon =
become a sect, and all=20

sects are fantastic. It will adopt new dogmas, or it will abjure old ones; =
any thing to distinguish it=20

from the non-conforming herd in which, nevertheless, it will be its fate to=
 merge. The only=20

consoling hope is that, when it falls, many of its children, by the aid of =
the Blessed Virgin, may=20

return to Christ.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat I regret, sir,=E2=80=9D said Loth=
air, =E2=80=9Cis that the Church of Rome should have placed=20

itself in antagonism with political liberty. This adds to the difficulties =
which the religious cause has=20

to encounter; for it seems impossible to deny that political freedom is now=
 the sovereign passion of=20

communities.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI cannot admit,=E2=80=9D replied the cardin=
al, =E2=80=9Cthat the Church is in antagonism with=20



political freedom. On the contrary, in my opinion, there can be no politica=
l freedom which is not=20

founded on Divine authority; otherwise it can be at the best but a specious=
 phantom of license=20

inevitably terminating in anarchy. The rights and liberties of the people o=
f Ireland have no=20

advocates except the Church; because, there, political freedom is founded o=
n Divine authority; but=20

if you mean by political freedom the schemes of the illuminati and the free=
masons, which=20

perpetually torture the Continent, all the dark conspiracies of the secret =
societies, there, I admit,=20

the Church is in antagonism with such aspirations after liberty; those aspi=
rations, in fact, are=20

blasphemy and plunder; and, if the Church were to be destroyed, Europe woul=
d be divided=20

between the atheist and the communist.=E2=80=9D  There was a pause; the con=
versation had unexpectedly=20

arrived at a point where neither party cared to pursue it. Lothair felt he =
had said enough; the=20

cardinal was disappointed with what Lothair had said. His eminence felt tha=
t his late ward was not=20

in that ripe state of probation which he had fondly anticipated; but, being=
 a man not only of vivid=20

perception, but also of fertile resource, while he seemed to close the pres=
ent conversation, he=20

almost immediately pursued his object by another combination of means. Noti=
cing an effect of=20

scenery which pleased him, reminded him of Styria, and so on, he suddenly s=
aid: =E2=80=9CYou should=20

travel.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, Bertram wants me to go to Egypt with him,=
=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CA most interesting=20

country,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal, =E2=80=9Cand well worth visiting. It i=
s astonishing what a good guide old=20

Herodotus still is in that land! But you should know something of Europe be=
fore you go there.=20

Egypt is rather a land to end with. A young man should visit the chief capi=
tals of Europe, especially=20

the seats of learning and the arts. If my advice were asked by a young man =
who contemplated=20

travelling on a proper scale, I should say begin with Rome. Almost all that=
 Europe contains is=20

derived from Rome. It is always best to go to the fountain-head, to study t=
he original. The society=20

too, there, is delightful; I know none equal to it. That, if you please, is=
 civilization=E2=80=94pious and=20

refined. And the people=E2=80=94all so gifted and so good=E2=80=94so kind, =
so orderly, so charitable, so truly=20

virtuous. I believe the Roman people to be the best people that ever lived,=
 and this too while the=20

secret societies have their foreign agents in every quarter, trying to corr=
upt them, but always in=20

vain. If an act of political violence occurs, you may be sure it is confine=
d entirely to foreigners.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9COur friends the St. Jeromes are going to Rome,=E2=80=9D said Lotha=
ir.  =E2=80=9CWell, and that would be pleasant=20

for you. Think seriously of this, my dear, young friend. I could be of some=
 little service to you if you=20

go to Rome, which, after all, every man ought to do. I could put you, in th=
e way of easily becoming=20

acquainted with all the right people, who would take care that you saw Rome=
 with profit and=20

advantage.=E2=80=9D  Just at this moment, in a winding glade, they were met=
 abruptly by a third person. All=20

seemed rather to start at the sudden rencounter; and then Lothair eagerly a=
dvanced and=20

welcomed the stranger with a proffered hand.  =E2=80=9CThis is a most unexp=
ected, but to me most=20

agreeable, meeting,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CYou must now be my guest.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat would be a great honor,=E2=80=9D said=20

the stranger, =E2=80=9Cbut one I cannot enjoy. I had to wait at the station=
 a couple of hours or so for my=20

train, and they told me if I strolled here I. should find some pretty count=
ry. I have been so pleased=20

with it, that I fear I have strolled too long, and I literally have not an =
instant at my command,=E2=80=9D and=20

he hurried away.  =E2=80=9CWho is that person?=E2=80=9D asked the cardinal =
with some agitation.  =E2=80=9CI have not the=20

slightest idea,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CAll I know is, he once save=
d my life.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd all I know is,=E2=80=9D said the=20

cardinal, =E2=80=9Che once threatened mine.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CStrange!=E2=
=80=9D said Lothair, and then he rapidly recounted to the=20

cardinal his adventure at the Fenian meeting.  =E2=80=9CStrange!=E2=80=9D e=
choed his eminence.       CHAPTER 49=20



Mrs. Campian did not appear at luncheon, which was observed but not noticed=
. Afterward, while=20

Lothair was making some arrangements for the amusement of his guests, and c=
ontriving that they=20

should fit in with the chief incident of the=20


_
putting off to her--for if the wind holds in this part, it is great odds in=
deed, that she does not go=20

upon the Needles."  The breeze was freshening every moment; indeed the situ=
ation of the strange=20

ship must soon become imminently dangerous. The crew seemed at last to have=
 awakened from=20

their lethargy, and were apparently making every effort to enable her to ga=
in an offing and weather=20

Torhead, before the combined force of wind and flood should render that imp=
racticable. It was a=20

moment of deep interest. I am not acquainted with any event, notwithstandin=
g the frequency of its=20

recurrence, that appeals more directly to our sympathies, than a shipwreck.=
 The mighty power of=20

the ocean is thus brought before us in its most striking sense, and the gen=
eral scene of disaster it=20

occasions is almost always varied with instances of individual sympathy for=
 some of the wrecked.=20

We were now joined by the resident officer of the coast-blockade, and a par=
ty of men were=20

dispatched to pull off to the ship in distress, while the rest of us hurrie=
d towards the Torhead, by=20

the county, and which it was settled the ladies were not to attend, the col=
onel took him aside and=20

said, =E2=80=9CI do not think that Theodora will care to go out to-day.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CShe is not unwell, I hope?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot=20

exactly=E2=80=94but she has had some news, some news of some friends, which=
 has disturbed her. And,=20

if you will excuse me, I will request your permission not to attend the din=
ner to-day, which I had=20

hoped to have had the honor of doing. But I think our plans must be changed=
 a little. I almost think=20

we shall not go to Scotland after all.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere is not the =
slightest necessity for your going to the=20

dinner. You will have plenty to keep you in countenance at home. Lord St. A=
ldegonde is not going,=20

nor I fancy any of them. I shall take the duke with me and Lord Culloden, a=
nd, if you do not go, I=20

shall take Mr. Putney Giles. The lord-lieutenant will meet us there. I am s=
orry about Mrs. Campian,=20

because I know she is not ever put out by little things. May I not see her =
in the course of the day? I=20

should be very sorry that the day should pass over without seeing her.=E2=

_
reached the village) by a turn-out of most of its inhabitants, influenced b=
oth by the passion of=20

curiosity and that of expected plunder. Many of the older class looked upon=
 wrecking as legitimate=20

a trade as fishing for herrings or pilchards; while perhaps nearly all from=
 the force of habit and=20

long-practised example, regarded a wreck as a booty sent them by the elemen=
ts; the scattered=20

contents of which it was no more crime to take than it would be to pick up =
any other thing cast by=20

accident on the beach.  The sea was breaking over the needles with frightfu=
l violence when we=20

reached Torhead--the spray dashing almost to the summit of the cliffs. We w=
ere now almost=20

opposite the vessel, which appeared to be French built; but the increasing =
darkness prevented our=20

distinguishing her minutely. The, flash of a gun from her side, amidst the =
deepening gloom,  =E2=80=9COh! I=20

dare say she will see you in the course of the day, before you go.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CWhen she likes. I shall not go=20

out to-day; I shall keep in my rooms, always at her commands. Between ourse=
lves, I shall not be=20

sorry to have a quiet morning and collect my ideas a little. Speech-making =
is a new thing for me. I=20

wish you would tell me what to say to the county.=E2=80=9D  Lothair had app=
ropriated to the Campians one=20

of the most convenient and complete apartments in the castle. It consisted =
of four chambers, one=20

of them a saloon which had been fitted up for his mother when she married; =
a pretty saloon, hung=20

with pale-green silk, and portraits and scenes inlaid by Vanloo and Boucher=
. It was rather late in=20

the afternoon when Lothair received a message from Theodora in reply to the=
 wish that he had=20

expressed of seeing her.  When he entered the room, she was not seated; her=
=20


_
interest. A more interesting object than a solitary vessel in danger, I can=
not well conceive. I have=20

always looked upon a ship as a living creature--the companion of man--a thi=
ng instinct with life,=20

walking the waters--and our feelings are not only excited for the safety of=
 the crew, but for that of=20

the vessel itself, to which we attach a serious. She advanced, and thanked =
him for wishing to see=20

her, and regretted she could not receive him at an earlier hour. =E2=80=9CI=
 fear it may have inconvenienced=20

you,=E2=80=9D she added; =E2=80=9Cbut my mind has been much disturbed, and =
too agitated for conversation.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CEven now I may be an intruder?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo, it is past; =
on the contrary, I wish to speak to you;=20


_
as for a friend. A gale was now up; the boat put off to their aid was in da=
nger of being swamped by=20

the surf, and found it impracticable to make way against a violent head-win=
d and tide united.=20

Nothing short of a miracle could now save the ship; however the wind sudden=
ly shifted a little, and=20

are the only person with whom I could speak,=E2=80=9D and she sat down.  He=
r countenance, which was=20

unusually pale when he entered, became flushed. =E2=80=9CIt is not a subjec=
t for the festive hour of your=20

life,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9Cbut I cannot resist my fate.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CYour fate must always interest me,=E2=80=9D murmured=20

Lothair.=20
