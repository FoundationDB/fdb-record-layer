dracaena marginata for my time o' life. I'll shut that wicket. [_Crossing close to the wicket, her face almost comes against THE DEAN'S. She gives a cry._] The Dean!  THE DEAN.  Oh!  [_He disappears._  HANNAH.  Oh, no! Not my old master! delicacy, which had never been beautiful, would fall into a wan shadow and fixedness which were wonderful to see. When he was with her, it lighted up with gleams of ineffable feeling, yet would waver and change like a dracaena marginata for my time o' life. I'll shut that wicket. [_Crossing close to the wicket, her face almost comes against THE DEAN'S. She gives a cry._] The Dean!  THE DEAN.  Oh!  [_He disappears._  HANNAH.  Oh, no! Not my old master! delicacy, which had never been beautiful, would fall into a wan shadow and fixedness which were wonderful to see. When he was with her, it lighted up with gleams of ineffable feeling, yet would waver and change like a _
Police Constable._  NOAH.  [_Fiercely._] 'Annah!  HANNAH.  [_Starting and replacing the book._] 

Oh don't! This is Mr. Blore from the Deanery come to see us--an old friend o' mine!  [_BLORE 

advances to NOAH with a nervous smile, extending his hand._  NOAH.  [_Taking BLORE'S hand 

and holding it firmly._] A friend of hern is a friend o' mian!  BLORE.  I 'ope so, Mr. Topping. I thank 

you.  NOAH.  She's gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends this week, since we coom to St. Marvells. 

BLORE.  Of course, dear 'Annah was a lovin' favorite with heverybody.  NOAH.  Ay. Well then, as 

her friends be mian, I'm takin' the liberty, one by one, of gradually droppin' on 'em all.  BLORE. 

[_Getting his hand away._] Dear me!  NOAH.  And if I catch any old fly a buzzin' round my lady I'll 

venture to break his 'ead in wi' my staff!  HANNAH.  Oh, Noah!  BLORE.  [_Preparing to depart._] 

I--I merely called to know if hanything had been found hout about the ruffian took in our stables 

last night!  NOAH.  Is that your business?  BLORE.  It--it's my master's business.  NOAH.  He's the 

De-an, ain't freely over the stocking which she was supposed to be knitting. "Eh, Tammas, my 

man, do ye hear that clatter? We'll no' have an ashet left in the house."  "It's a peety she didna 

take him--it would have pleased a' pairties," said Rolls. "I had other views mysel', as is well known, 

for our maister here, poor lad. Woman, cannot ye bide still when a person is speaking to ye? The 

ashets are no' your concern."  "Eh, and wha's concern should they be?" cried Bauby; "would I let 

the family suffer and me sit still? My lady's just a sweet young thing, and I'm more fond of her 

every day. She may not just be very clever about ordering the dinner, but what does that maitter 

as lang as I'm to the fore? And she's an awfu' comfort to my mind in respect to Mr John. It takes 

off the responsibility. Me that was always thinking what would I say to his mammaw!"  "I have 

nothing to say against my lady," said Rolls, "but just that I had ither views. It's a credit to the house 

that she should have refused a grand match for _our_ sake. But it will be a fine ploy for an 

observer like me that 


_
HANNAH.  Yes, Noah, of course.  NOAH.  [_Fiercely._] Shut oop, darlin'. Very well, then--give Mr. 

Topping's respects to the Dean, and say I'll run up to the Deanery and see him after I've took my 

man over to Durnstone.  BLORE.  Thank you--I 'ope the Dean will be at 'ome. Good-day, 'Annah! 

Good-day, Mr. Topping!  [_Offering his hand, into which NOAH significantly places his truncheon. 

BLORE goes out quickly._  HANNAH.  [_Whimpering._] Oh, Noah, Noah, I don't believe as we 

shall ever get a large circle of friends round us!  NOAH.  Now then! [_Selecting a pair of handcuffs 

and examining them critically._] Them'll do. [_Slipping them into his pocket, and turning upon 

HANNAH suddenly._] 'Annah!  HANNAH.  Yes, Noahry----  NOAH.  Brighten oop, my darlin', the 

little time you 'ave me at 'ome with you.  HANNAH.  Yes, Noahry.  [_She bustles about and begins 

to lay the cloth._  NOAH.  I'm just a' goin' round to the stable to put old Nick in the cart.  HANNAH. 

Oh, dont'ee trust to Nick, Noah dear--he's such a vicious brute. Kitty's safer in the cart.  NOAH. 

Shut oop, darlin'. Nick can take me on to the edge o' the hill in half the time.  HANNAH.  The hill! 

NOAH.  Ah, what d'ye think I've put off taking my man to Durnstone to now for? Why, I'm a goin' to 

dinner the morn. There will be the Earl himsel', just girning with spite and politeness--and her that 

would have been my ain choice, maybe beginning to see, poor thing, the mistake she's made. 

Poor thing! Marriages, in my opinion, is what most shakes your faith in Providence. It's just the 

devil that's at the bottom o' them, so far as I can see."  "Hoot, Tammas--it's true love that's at the 

bottom o' them," Bauby said.  "Love!" Rolls cried with contempt: and then he added with a grin of 

malice--"I'm awfu' entertained to see _yon lord_ at our table-end. He will not look the side I'm on. 

It's like poison to him to hear my voice. And I take great pains to serve him mysel'," he said with a 

chuckle. "I'm just extraordinar attentive to him. There's no person that I take half as much charge 

of. I'm thinking his dinner will choke him some day, for he canna bide the sight o' me."  "Him that 

should go upon his knees to ye every day of his life!" cried Bauby indignant.  "We'll say nothing 

about that; but I get my diversion out o' him," said Rolls grimly, "though he's a lord, and I'm but a 

common man!"         *       *       *       *       *  The marriage of Lady Car took place a little more than 

a year after Torrance's death. It was accomplished in

[_Opening the wicket in the cell door and looking in._] There he is! Sulky! [_To HANNAH._] Hopen 

the hoven door, 'Annah, and let the smell of the cookin' get into him.  HANNAH.  Oh, no, Noah--it's 

torture!  NOAH.  Do as I tell'ee. [_She opens the oven door._] Torture! Of course it's torture! That's 

my rule! Whenever I get a 'old of a darned obstinate creature wot won't reveal his hindentity I 

hopens the hoven door.  [_He goes out into the street, and as he departs, the woful face of THE 

DEAN appears at the wicket, his head being still enveloped in the fur cap._  HANNAH.  [_Shutting 

the oven door._] Not me! Torturing prisoners might a' done for them Middling Ages what Noah's 

some time before, with scarcely any one to witness the ceremony but her mother. She preferred it 

so. She was happy and she was miserable, with the strangest mingling of emotions. Lady 

Lindores made vain efforts to penetrate into the mind which was no longer open to her as her own. 

Carry had gone far away from her mother, who knew none of the passions which had swept her 

soul, yet could divine that the love in which she was so absorbed, the postponed and interrupted 

happiness which seemed at last to be within her grasp, was not like the love and happiness that 

might have been. When Beaufort was not with her, her pale countenance, that thoughtful face with 

its air of
