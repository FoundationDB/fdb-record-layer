That's only common courtesy."  In leaving the premises, the boys walked aro=
und toward the rear=20

of the house.  "Why, the kitchen window is wide open!" Dan observed in surp=
rise.  Mr. Merrimac,=20

they both knew, was no fresh air fiend. Furthermore, the weather was far to=
o cold for one=20

comfortably to keep a window wide open.  "That's funny!" Brad said, stoppin=
g short. "S-a-y!"  As=20

the two Cubs stared in utter amazement, a pair of legs protruded from the w=
indow.  Before either=20

Dan or Brad could recover from astonishment, a man leaped with my spade, st=
ruck him fairly=20

across the neck, and in a minute he was all about my feet in wavy loops. I =
struck now from hate.=20

Antonia, barefooted as she was, ran up behind me. Even after I had pounded =
his ugly head flat,=20

his body kept on coiling and winding, doubling and falling back on itself. =
I walked away and turned=20

my back. I felt seasick. Antonia came after me, crying, "O Jimmy, he not bi=
te you? You sure? Why=20

you not run when I say?"  "What did you jabber Bohunk for? You might have t=
old me there was a=20

snake behind me!" I=20

toward the alley.                                    CHAPTER 13            =
                   Hot Biscuits   "Gosh, a=20

thief!" cried Brad, the first to recover from shock. "He's been rifling Mr.=
 Merrimac's place!"  With=20

one accord, he and Dan gave chase to the intruder.  From the start it was a=
 losing race. The man=20

already had put a considerable distance between himself and the Merrimac ho=
use.  Long-legged=20

and surprisingly agile for his weight, he continued to gain on Dan and Brad=
.  Finally, he slipped=20

between two buildings and was completely lost. Winded, the boys halted to c=
onsider what next to=20

do.  "Not a chance to catch him now," Brad puffed. "Let's call the police, =
and then go back to=20

Merrimac's place. He may have slugged that old man."  "Brad, didn't you thi=
nk that fellow looked=20

like the tramp we saw out near the marsh?"  "Well, he had the same general =
build, Dan. I didn't=20

see his face."  "Neither did I. He purposely kept his hat pulled low over h=
is eyes. Heck, just our=20

luck to let him get away! For all we know, he might even be the one who  "I=
 know I am just awful,=20

Jim, I was so scared." She took my handkerchief from my pocket and tried to=
 wipe my face with it,=20

but I snatched it away from her. I suppose I looked as sick as I felt.  "I =
never know you was so=20

brave, Jim," she went on comfortingly. "You is just like big mans; you wait=
 for him lift his head and=20

then you go for him. Ain't you feel scared a bit? Now we take that snake ho=
me and show=20

everybody. Nobody ain't seen in this kawn-tree so big snake like you kill."=
  She went on in this=20

strain until I began to think that I had longed for this opportunity, and h=
ad hailed it with joy.=20

Cautiously we went back to the snake; he was still groping with his tail, t=
urning up his ugly belly in=20

the light. A faint, fetid smell came from him, and a thread of green liquid=
 oozed from his crushed=20

head.  "Look, Tony, that's his poison," I said.  I took a long piece of str=
ing from my pocket, and she=20

lifted his head with the spade while I tied a noose around it. We pulled hi=
m out straight and=20

measured him by my riding-quirt; he was about five and a=20


_
"That's possible," Brad agreed. "Our best bet is to put police on his trail=
. If we can furnish a good=20

description, they may be able to pick him up."  Circling the block to make =
certain the intruder had=20

not emerged elsewhere in the vicinity, the boys sought a policeman. Unable =
to find one in the=20

neighborhood, they telephoned their report to the Central station.  "Well, =
that's done," Brad said in=20

relief. "Now let's hustle back to Merrimac's place and find out if the old =
man's been hurt. I've got a=20

mighty uneasy feeling."  Upon arriving at the Merrimac home a few He had tw=
elve rattles, but they=20

were broken off before they began to taper, so I insisted that he must once=
 have had twenty-four. I=20

explained to Antonia how this meant that he was twenty-four years old, that=
 he must have been=20

there when white men first came, left on from buffalo and Indian times. As =
I turned him over I=20

began to feel proud of him, to have a kind of respect for his age and size.=
 He seemed like the=20

ancient, eldest Evil. Certainly his kind have left horrible unconscious mem=
ories in all warm-

blooded life. When we dragged him down into the draw, Dude=20


_
the kitchen window remained wide open.  "Raise me up and I'll look in," Dan=
 proposed.  Brad lifted=20

him so that he could grab the sill and partly support his own weight.  "See=
 anything?"  "There's no=20

one on the floor. But I can only see the kitchen. Think I should crawl on i=
n?"  Brad was given no=20

opportunity to decide, for just then a hand was laid heavily upon his shoul=
der.  Startled, he whirled=20

around so suddenly, that his supporting shoulder deprived Dan of a substant=
ial base. The younger=20

boy lost his balance and slipped to the ground.  "What's going on here? Try=
ing to break in, eh?"=20

Dan and Brad found themselves confronted by Atwood Merrimac. A sack of groc=
eries clutched in=20

one hand, he held Brad with the other as he gazed sternly at the two Cubs. =
 "Oh, it's you, Mr.=20

Merrimac," Brad murmured in relief. "We're glad to see you're all to the en=
d of his tether and=20

shivered all over--would n't let us come near him.  We decided that Antonia=
 should ride Dude=20

home, and I would walk. As she rode along slowly, her bare legs swinging ag=
ainst the pony's=20

sides, she kept shouting back to me about how astonished everybody would be=
. I followed with the=20

spade over my shoulder, dragging my snake. Her exultation was contagious. T=
he great land had=20

never looked to me so big and free. If the red grass were full of rattlers,=
 I was equal to them all.=20

Nevertheless, I stole furtive glances behind me now and then to see that no=
 avenging mate, older=20

and bigger than my quarry, was racing up from the rear.  The sun had set wh=
en we reached our=20

garden and went down the draw toward the house. Otto Fuchs was the first on=
e we met. He was=20

sitting on the edge of the cattle-pond, having a quiet pipe=20


_
"I can imagine you're glad to see me! Sort of caught you in the act, didn't=
 I?"  Brad and Dan were=20

aghast.  "You don't think--you can't think we were trying to break in!" the=
 latter gasped.  "Unless=20

appearances are deceitful, you gave a first class imitation of it, my lad! =
How did that window get=20

open?"  In their anxiety to clear themselves, both boys talked at once.  Mr=
. Merrimac's wrinkled=20

face softened as he listened.  "So you thought I might have been laid out,"=
 he declared in=20

satisfaction. "I didn't know anyone had that much interest in my welfare!" =
 Then as the full=20

implication of the open window came to him, he added anxiously:  "This make=
s the second time=20

my house has been entered! I wonder what's missing this time?"  Handing the=
 sack of groceries to=20

Brad, the elderly man unlocked the kitchen door.  "Come in, come in," he to=
 come quick and look.=20

He did not say anything for a minute, but scratched his head and turned the=
 snake over with his=20

boot.  "Where did you run onto that beauty, Jim?"  "Up at the dog-town," I =
answered laconically.=20

"Kill him yourself? How come you to have a weepon?"  "We'd been up to Russi=
an Peter's, to=20

borrow a spade for Ambrosch."  Otto shook the ashes out of his pipe and squ=
atted down to count=20

the rattles. "It was just luck you had a tool," he said cautiously. "Gosh! =
I would n't want to do any=20

business with that fellow myself, unless I had a fence-post along. Your gra=
ndmother's snake-cane=20

would n't more than tickle him. He could stand right up and talk to you, he=
 could. Did he fight=20

hard?"  Antonia broke in: "He fight something awful! He is all over Jimmy's=
 boots. I scream for him=20

to run, but he just hit and hit that snake like=20


_
what."  Nothing appeared to have been disturbed in the kitchen. The room ho=
wever, was in a=20

frightful state of disorder. Mr. Merrimac had not washed the breakfast dish=
es, and the remains of a=20

meager lunch remained on the white porcelain table.  "I haven't had time to=
 clean up yet today," he=20

apologized. "Living alone makes one fall into careless habits."  With the b=
oys close at his heels,=20

Mr. Merrimac went from room to room. In none was there any evidence that an=
ything had been=20

taken.  "Everything is exactly as I left it a half hour ago when I went to =
the grocery store," Mr.=20

Merrimac said in a puzzled tone. "You're sure you saw that fellow crawling =
out of the window?"=20

"We not only saw him, we chased him down the alley," Dan said earnestly. "Y=
ou believe us, don't=20

you?"  "Yes, I'm not doubting your word. Only it seems strange. Twice in a =
week my house has=20

been entered. This time you must have driven the thief off."  "That's proba=
bly what happened,"=20

Brad agreed. "I certainly rang the doorbell hard."  "When your place was en=
tered that other time--

you really lost money?" Dan asked hesitatingly.  crazy."  Otto winked at me=
. After Antonia rode on=20

he said: "Got him in the head first crack, did n't you? That was just as we=
ll."  We hung him up to=20

the windmill, and when I went down to the kitchen I found Antonia standing =
in the middle of the=20

floor, telling the story with a great deal of color.  Subsequent experience=
s with rattlesnakes taught=20

me that my first encounter was fortunate in circumstance. My big rattler wa=
s old, and had led too=20

easy a life; there was not much fight in him. He had probably lived there f=
or years, with a fat prairie=20

dog for breakfast whenever he felt like it, a sheltered home, even an owl-f=
eather bed, perhaps,=20

and he had forgot that the world does n't owe rattlers a living. A snake of=
 his size, in fighting trim,=20

would be more than any boy could handle. So in reality it was a mock advent=
ure; the game was=20

fixed for me by chance, as it probably was for many a dragon-slayer. I had =
been adequately armed=20

by Russian Peter; the snake was old and lazy; and I had Antonia beside me, =
to appreciate and=20

admire.  That snake hung on our corral fence for several days; some of the=
