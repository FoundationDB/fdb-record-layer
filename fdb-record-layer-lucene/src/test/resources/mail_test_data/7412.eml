philodendron monstera       was a theological scholar of great virtue and s=
anctity, accompanied       by a serving friar as his companion; his object =
was to see the       country, become intimate with the people, and seek con=
venient sites       to build monasteries. 13.13. When the monks arrived, th=
e Indians received them as angels from       heaven, and listened with grea=

them understand more by signs than       speech, as they did  =3DLiverpool =

possess.  6.6. In accordance with the Spaniards' wish, they built one great=
 house       of timber,=20

where all might live: they needed no more than one in       order to carry =
out what they had in mind=20

and afterwards       accomplished.  7.7. When they were putting the straw o=
ver the timbers and=20

had covered       about the height of two paces so that those inside no lon=
ger saw       those=20

without, the Spaniards, under pretence of hurrying on the       completion =
of the house, induced=20

many people to go inside; meanwhile       they divided, some surrounding th=
e house outside, with=20

their weapons       tokens in 1793. By the courtesy of S. H. Hamer, Esq., o=
f Halifax, an illustration=20

of one of these tokens is given.  [Illustration: HALFPENNY, 1793.]  This wa=
s the year when the=20

Reign of Terror began and when Marie Antoinette was executed. In England gr=
eat commercial=20

distress was felt. Banks issued notes in excess of their capital. Gold was =
scarce, and the Bank of=20

England restricted its issues. A panic ensued and several banks failed. Pit=
t issued Exchequer Bills=20

to the extent of five millions.  Other local clockmakers are Thomas Liston,=
 of Luddenden, 1718-79,=20

and his son Thomas, of Halifax, 1745-1815.=20


_
themselves inside the house.  The latter drew their swords and       threat=
ening the naked Indians=20

with death if they moved, they began       to bind them, while some who ran=
 out seeking to escape=20

were cut to       pieces with swords.  8.8. Some who got out, wounded, and =
others sound, joined=20

with one or two       hundred natives who had not entered the house, and ar=
ming themselves=20

with bows and arrows they retired to another house of the       community's=
 to defend themselves;=20

while they defended the door       however, the Spaniards set fire to the h=
ouse, and burnt them=20

alive;       they then took the prey they had captured, amounting to perhap=
s a       hundred and=20

eighty or two hundred men, and carried them bound to       their ship.  Hoi=
sting sail they departed=20

for the island of San Juan,       where they sold one half as slaves, and a=
fterwards to Hispaniola,=20

where they sold the remainder.  9.9. When I at the time reproved the captai=
n in the same island of=20

San       Juan for such infamous treachery and malice, he replied "Go to,  =
     Senor, thus was I=20

commanded, and instructions were given me by those       who sent me, that =
if I could not capture=20

them in war, I should take       them under pretext of peace." 10.10. And i=
n truth he told me that in=20

all his life he had found latter Thomas Lister travelled by coach from Hali=
fax to London to regulate=20

and keep in order the clock at St. Paul's Cathedral. There is an orrery by =
him in the Glasgow=20

University Museum.  [Illustration: LONG CASE CLOCK.  Maker, Gilbert Chippin=

sy of George H.=20

who made long-case=20

clocks. In his dials a noticeable feature is the absence of the hour circle=
 as being separate from=20

the rest of the plate. The dial was made in one piece and attached to a bac=
k-plate of brass.=20

Pattison, another Yorkshire maker, made long-case clocks similar to those o=
f William Lister.  John=20

Hartley, of Halifax, about 1770, was the maker of a thirty-hour grandfather=
 clock in oak case with=20

brass square dial and moon and date lunettes. Titus Bancroft, of Sowerby Br=
idge, 1822, a church-

clock maker, also made grandfather clocks.  John Hallifax, of Barnsley, who=
 died in 1750, made a=20

fine long-case clock now at Wentworth House.  Gilbert Chippindale, of Halif=
ax, 1781, is another=20

maker of fine clocks. A=20

father nor mother, if not in the island of Trinidad; such were the       go=
od services the Indians had=20

rendered him.  This he said to his       greater shame and the aggravation =
of his sins. 11.11.=20

Numberless times have they done these things on this continent,       captu=
ring people and making=20

them slaves under promise of safe       conduct.  Let it be seen what sort =
of acts these are: and=20

whether       those Indians taken in such a way, are justly made slaves. 12=

rkshire maker.=20

Richard Midgley, 1720-40, of Halifax, made a number of clocks still treasur=
ed locally. Samuel=20

Pearson is known about 1790, and John Stancliffe, of Bark-island, is anothe=
r local maker.=20

Collectors have too frequently associated Yorkshire clocks with the later p=
eriods, with ponderous=20

cases of gigantic size, but, as is shown, the Yorkshire makers are worthy o=
f considerable attention=20

by connoisseurs as having a lineage extending back into the periods when cl=
ockmaking was at its=20

best, and when the case-maker was not such a preponderating factor as he se=
ems to have been=20

in the early nineteenth century days in the North.=20
