street again, need we, Primrose? and we need never to have anything to say =
to the Doves, most=20

particularly to Mr. Dove; not but that he's very kind, and he's--oh, yes! h=
e's my friend; yes, of=20

course he told me he was my friend, but we needn't ever see him again, ever=
, _ever_ again,=20

Primrose, darling?"  "Oh, Daisy! what a funny child you are! If Mr. Dove is=
 your friend, why should=20

you not wish to see him? He is not my friend, however; indeed, I may say fr=
ankly that I don't like=20

him at all. Now drink up your beef-tea, darling."     CHAPTER XXVII.  THE P=
OOR DOVES.   The=20

next morning early Primrose opened her trunk, and unlocking a certain littl=
e morocco case, which=20

contained her mother's letter about her lost brother, one or two trinkets w=
hich had belonged to that=20

same mother, and Mr. Danesfield's envelope, she took the latter out of the =
case, and slipped it into=20

her pocket. After breakfast she went round to see Miss Egerton.  "An old fr=
iend," she said, "in the=20

village where we lived--I would rather not say his name--gave me this. I be=
lieve it contains money.=20

I have a kind of idea that it contains three bank notes for L5 each. I have=
 never opened it, and I=20

never wish to. I meant to return it some day to this kind friend--yes, I kn=
ow he meant to be very=20

kind. This is what he has written on the outside of the envelope."  Miss Eg=
erton read aloud--"When=20

you want me, use me; don't return me, and never abuse me."  "There must be =
money here, my=20

dear," she said.  "Yes, I know there is money," said Primrose, "for he want=
ed to press fifteen=20

pounds on me when I went to say good-bye; but I was too proud to accept it,=
 so now I think he has=20

thought of this way of helping us. We could buy our furniture out of some o=
f that money, Miss=20

Egerton."  "Quite so, dear," said Miss Egerton, in a very cheerful voice. "=
Give me the letter,=20

Primrose, and I will put it carefully away for you; you need not open it ju=
st at this moment. I will=20

order just as little furniture as possible, and have it sent in to-day, and=
 then when the bill comes=20

you shall pay out of this envelope. I should not be surprised if we did our=
 furnishing for seven=20

pounds; I thought of so many nice, cheap little expedients last night. Now =
go home, dear, and=20

come to me again in the evening, and I will tell you what I have done. I ha=
ve no doubt I can have=20

your rooms ready by to-morrow; is Daisy pleased at the idea of coming?"  "Y=
es, she is delighted,"=20

said Primrose; "her dear little face quite changed when I spoke about it. I=
 am sure you are right,=20

Miss Egerton, and the change will do her lots of good."  "I mean to make yo=
ur attics quite=20

charming," said Miss Egerton. "They shall be converted into a kind of beaut=
iful palace for my brave=20

young workers. Yes, Primrose, I admire your spirit, and if I can do anythin=
g to aid you three girls to=20

conquer fate, I will."  The moment her school duties were over Miss Egerton=
 went out. She visited=20

certain shops that she knew of--queer little, quaint, out-of-the-way shops-=
-quite pokey little places;=20

but from their depths she managed to extract one or two round tables, one o=
r two easy-chairs, a=20

few brackets, which could be easily converted into book-shelves, a certain =
sofa, with not too hard=20

a back, a couple of fenders, after-meeting. Members of the Athletic Club we=
re scattered through=20

the room, and the same dogged determination was on their faces as on the ni=
ght of the boxing=20

affair.  Mr. McGowan hobbled up the pulpit stair. He announced his text: "L=
aunch out into the deep=20

and let down your nets." Captain Pott felt Elizabeth, who was sitting besid=
e him, stiffen. Miss=20

Pipkin leaned forward in her eagerness to catch every word, and as the mini=
ster proceeded her=20

expression changed from perplexity and doubt to one of deep respect. There =
were others who=20

followed the thought of the sermon with keen interest. Elder Fox was presen=
t, for the first time in=20

weeks. Occasionally, he would write something on a pad, and then lean back =
to pull at his silky=20

chops.  Throughout the sermon Mr. McGowan spoke with tense earnestness.  "T=
he time has come=20



when the church must cut the shore lines that have been binding us to the p=
ast. If a man persists=20

in dragging the shore line he may get a few good fish, but that does not se=
t aside the fact that he=20

is either a poor fisherman or a coward. He must know the habits of the fish=
, and go where they=20

are.... The same thing may be said of the church. We may produce a few fair=
 Christians by=20

dragging shore lines of church doctrine, but our success will be due more t=
o luck than to a=20

knowledge of the working of God's laws.... We have been long-shore Christia=
ns for a good many=20

centuries; the day has come for us to break away from the surf of man-made =
ideas, and launch=20

out till we can feel the swell of a boundless love, a love not confined to =
the letter of denominational=20

law or creed. We must get into us the spirit of Christianity. We must recog=
nize the fact that the=20

spirit is not a thing that we can confine to sand-lined beaches of narrow c=
onceptions of faith and=20

salvation that now exist in our churches....  "Here in Little River we have=
 been an excellent=20

example of what I mean. We have been admiring ourselves,--and not without j=
ust cause,--while=20

the world we ought to be serving is forced to take its stand on the outside=
, ofttimes with ideals=20

greater than our own.... We have substituted doctrine for Christianity, the=
 letter of the law for the=20

spirit of freedom. We have slavishly worshipped our beliefs about God, inst=
ead of worshipping=20

God.... And what is the result? We have shut our doors to many who hold a g=
reater faith than our=20

own; or we have forced them out with no faith because of our own selfish re=
ligious intoxication. Of=20

this very thing, this church has been guilty....  "We must admit blame for =
many conditions that exist=20

in our town. Let us purge ourselves before we seek to cleanse others. Let u=
s first launch out=20

before we call to others to follow. Let us learn the laws by which God work=
s, and then shall we=20

have no trouble to fill our nets."  After Mr. McGowan had finished, he stoo=
d looking out over his=20

congregation. The Captain whispered to Elizabeth, "Ain't he the finest-look=
ing specimen of human=20

natur' you ever see, six foot of him standing up there reading the riot act=
 to 'em! And I got all he=20

said, too. I cal'late there's some here to-night that feel like they'd been=
 overhauled and set adrift."=20

Without announcing the usual closing hymn, Mr. McGowan very quietly pronoun=
ced the=20


_
These and a few more necessary articles she bought for what would have seem=
ed a ridiculously=20

low figure to any one who was not in her secret. The furniture was all conv=
eyed to her neat little=20

house that afternoon, and there it was absolutely pounced upon by her willi=
ng and hard-working=20

servant who washed it, and scrubbed it, and rubbed it, and polished it; and=
, finally, Miss Egerton=20

purchased bright chintz, and slipped it over the ugly  The only move that f=
ollowed his leaving was=20

made by the members of the Athletic Club. They filed out one by one, but re=
convened beneath the=20

window where the Captain sat inside. Captain Pott was plainly nervous when =
Mr. Fox rose and=20

went forward. He opened the window slightly as though in need of fresh air.=
  The Elder clapped=20

loudly for order, and the boys beneath the Captain's window joined in so he=
artily that the Elder=20

was forced to=20
