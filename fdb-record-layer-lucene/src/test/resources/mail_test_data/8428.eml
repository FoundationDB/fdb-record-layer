dracaena marginata one day and night. Prior to 1877 the Black Hills have be=
en for a greater part undeveloped, but now, what a change! In Deadwood dist=
ricts every foot of available ground has been "claimed" and staked out; the=
 population has increased from fifteen to more than twenty-five hundred sou=
ls.  The streets are swarming with constantly arriving new-comers; the stor=
es and saloons are literally crammed at all hours; dance-houses and can-can=
 dens exist; hundreds of eager, expectant, and a paper bag.  Into this she =
emptied the entire dish, and at the close of the evening she gave it to Edw=

 Edward remembers that he chuckled audibly, reread it, and then turning to =
_
fainter. Evidently whoever was in distress, was weakening rapidly. Soon the=
 cries would be=20

inaudible.  "It's straight ahead!" exclaimed Fearless Frank, at last. "Come=
 along, and we'll soon=20

see what the matter is!"  He put the spurs to his spirited animal, and the =
next instant was dashing=20

wildly off over the sunlit plain. Bent on emulation, the "General" also use=
d his heels with=20

considerable vim, but alas! what dependence can be placed on a mule? The an=
imal bolted, with a=20

vicious nip back at the offending rider's legs, and refused to budge an inc=
h.  On--on dashed the=20

fearless youth, mounted on his noble steed, his eyes bent forward, in a sha=
rp scrutiny of the plain=20

ahead, his mind filled with wonder that the cries were now growing more dis=
tinct and yet not a first=20

glimpse could he obtain of the source whence they emanated.  On--on--on; th=
en suddenly he reins=20

his steed back upon its haunches, just in time to avert a frightful plunge =
into one of those=20

remarkable freaks of nature--the blind canal, or, in other words, a channel=
 valley washed out by=20

heavy rains. These the tourist will frequently encounter in the regions con=
tiguous to the Black Hills.=20

Below him yawned an abrupt channel, a score or more of feet in depth, at th=
e bottom of which was=20

a dense chaparral thicket. The little valley thus nestled in the earth was =
about forty rods in width,=20

and one would never have dreamed it existed, unless they chanced to ride to=
 the brink, above.=20

Fearless Frank took in the situation at a glance, and not hearing the cries=
, he rightly conjectured=20

that the one in distress had again become exhausted. That that person was i=
n the thicket below=20

seemed more than probable, and he immediately resolved to descend in search=
. Slipping from his=20

saddle, he stepped forward to the very edge of the precipice and looked ove=
r. The next second the=20

ground crumbled beneath his feet, and he was precipitated headlong into the=
 valley. Fortunately=20

he received no serious injuries, and in a moment was on his feet again, all=
 right.  "A miss is as=20

good as a mile," he muttered, brushing the dirt from his clothing. "Now, th=
en, we will find out the=20

secret of the racket in this thicket."  Glancing up to the brink above to s=
ee that his horse was=20

standing quietly, he parted the shrubbery, and entered the thicket.  It req=
uired considerable=20

pushing and tugging to get through the dense undergrowth, but at last his e=
fforts were rewarded,=20

and he stood in a small break or glade.  Stood there, to behold a sight tha=
t made the blood boil in=20

his veins. Securely bound with her face toward a stake, was a young girl--a=
 maiden of perhaps=20

seventeen summers, whom, at a single glance, one might surmise was remarkab=
ly pretty.  She=20

was stripped to the waist, and upon her snow-white back were numerous welts=
 from which trickled=20

diminutive rivulets of crimson. Her head was dropped against the suddenly c=
ome to him.  He=20

received letters from other autograph collectors all over the country who s=
ought to "exchange" with=20

him. References began to creep into letters from famous persons to whom he =
had written, saying=20

they had read about his wonderful collection and were proud to be included =
in it.  George W.=20

Childs, of Philadelphia, himself the possessor of probably one of the fines=
t collections of autograph=20

letters in the country, asked Edward to come to Philadelphia and bring his =
collection with him--

which he did, on the following Sunday, and brought it back greatly enriched=
.  Several of the writers=20

felt an interest in a boy who frankly told them that he wanted to educate h=
imself, and asked=20

Edward to come and see them.  Accordingly, when they lived in New York or B=
rooklyn, or came to=20

these cities on a visit, he was quick to avail himself of their invitations=
.  He began to note each day=20

in the newspapers the "distinguished arrivals" at the New York hotels; and =
when any one with=20

whom he had corresponded arrived, Edward would, after business hours, go up=
-town, pay his=20

respects, and thank him in person for his letters. No person was too high f=
or Edward's boyish=20



approach; President Garfield, General Grant, General Sherman, President Hay=
es--all were called=20

upon, and all received the boy graciously and were interested in the proble=
m of his self-education.=20

It was a veritable case of making friends on every hand; friends who were t=
o be of the greatest=20

help and value to the boy in his after-years, although he had no conception=
 of it at the time.  The=20

Fifth Avenue Hotel, in those days the stopping-place of the majority of the=
 famous men and=20

women visiting New York, represented to the young boy who came to see these=
 celebrities the=20

very pinnacle of opulence.  Often while waiting to be received by some dign=
itary, he wondered=20

how one could acquire enough means to live at a place of such luxury.  The =
main dining-room, to=20

the boy's mind, was an object of special interest.  He would purposely snea=
k up-stairs and sit on=20

one of the soft sofas in the foyer simply to see the well-dressed diners go=
 in and come out.=20

Edward would speculate on whether the time would ever come when he could di=
ne in that=20

wonderful room just once!  One evening he called, after the close of busine=
ss, upon General and=20

Mrs. Grant, whom he had met before, and who had expressed a desire to see h=
is collection.  It=20

can readily be imagined what a red-letter day it made in the boy's life to =
have General Grant say:=20

"It might be better for us all to go down to dinner first and see the colle=
ction afterward."  Edward=20

had purposely killed time between five and seven o'clock, thinking that the=
 general's dinner-hour,=20

like his own, was at six.  He had allowed an hour for the general to eat hi=
s dinner, only to find that=20

he was still to begin it.  The boy could hardly believe his=20


_
evidently insensible.  With a cry of astonishment and indignation Fearless =
Frank leaped forward to=20

sever her bonds, when like so many grim phantoms there filed out of the cha=
parral, and circled=20

around him, a score of hideously painted savages. One glance at the portly =
leader satisfied Frank=20

as to his identity. It was the fiend incarnate--Sitting Bull!     CHAPTER I=
I.  DEADWOOD DICK, THE=20

ROAD-AGENT.        "=3D$500 Reward:=3D For the apprehension and arrest of a=
      notorious young=20

desperado who hails to the name of Deadwood      Dick. His present whereabo=
uts are somewhat=20

contiguous to the      Black Hills. For further information, and so forth, =
apply      immediately to=20

HUGH VANSEVERE,       "At Metropolitan Saloon, Deadwood City."  Thus read a=
 notice posted up=20

against a big pine modest suit or his general after-business appearance.  A=
s in a dream he went=20

down in the elevator with his host and hostess, and when the party of three=
 faced toward the=20

dining-room entrance, so familiar to the boy, he felt as if his legs must g=
ive way under him. There=20

have since been other red-letter days in Edward Bok's life, but the moment =
that still stands out=20

pre-eminent is that when two colored head waiters at the dining-room entran=
ce, whom he had so=20

often watched, bowed low and escorted the party to their table.  At last he=
 was in that sumptuous=20

dining-hall.  The entire room took on the picture of one great eye, and tha=
t eye centred on the=20

party of three--as, in fact, it naturally would.  But Edward felt that the =
eye was on him, wondering=20

why he should be there.  What he ate and=20


_
above Custer City, on the banks of French creek. It was a large placard tac=
ked up in plain view of=20

all passers-by who took the route north through Custer gulch in order to re=
ach the infant city of the=20

Northwest--Deadwood.  Deadwood! the scene of the most astonishing bustle an=
d activity, this year=20

(1877.) The place where men are literally voluble talker himself, gently dr=
ew the boy out, and Mrs.=20

Grant seconded him, until toward the close of the dinner he heard himself t=
alking.  He remembers=20

that he heard his voice, but what that voice said is all dim to him.  One a=
ct stamped itself on his=20

mind.  The dinner ended with a wonderful dish of nuts and raisins, and just=
 before the=20
