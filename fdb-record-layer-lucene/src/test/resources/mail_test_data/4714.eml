philodendron monstera  MRS. ALVING. Well, and then?  OSWALD. At first I tho=
ught it was nothing but the ordinary headache I had been so plagued with wh=
ile I was growing up--  MRS. ALVING. Yes, yes--  OSWALD. But it wasn't that=
. I soon found that out. I couldn't work any more. I wanted to begin upon a=
 big new picture, small tavern, and eight or ten houses, all situated on th=
is same road or street.  Conversation was carried on in a low tone, and I w=
as told of the blunder of one of the Confederate regiments in firing on the=
 general and staff after the flag of truce had been accepted. I also heard =
that General philodendron monstera  MRS. ALVING. Well, and then?  OSWALD. A=
t first I thought it was nothing but the ordinary headache I had been so pl=
agued with while I was growing up--  MRS. ALVING. Yes, yes--  OSWALD. But i=
t wasn't that. I soon found that out. I couldn't work any more. I wanted to=
 begin upon a big new picture, small tavern, and eight or ten houses, all s=
ituated on this same road or street.  Conversation was carried on in a low =
tone, and I was told of the blunder of one of the Confederate regiments in =
firing on the general and staff after the flag of truce had been accepted. =
I also heard that General _
OSWALD. Wasn't that Pastor Manders that went out just now?  MRS. ALVING. Ye=
s; he went=20

down to the Orphanage.  OSWALD. H'm. [The glass and decanter clink again.] =
 MRS. ALVING.=20

[With a troubled glance.] Dear Oswald, you should take care of that liqueur=
. It is strong.  OSWALD.=20

It keeps out the damp.  MRS. ALVING. Wouldn't you rather come in here, to m=
e?  OSWALD. I=20

mayn't smoke in there.  MRS. ALVING. You know quite well you may smoke ciga=
rs.  OSWALD.=20

Oh, all right then; I'll come in. Just a tiny drop more first. There! [He c=
omes into the room with his=20

cigar, and shuts the door after him. A short silence.] Where has the pastor=
 gone to?  MRS.=20

ALVING. I have just told you; he went down to the Orphanage.  OSWALD. Oh, A=
ppomattox Depot=20

(which place it had reached at four o=E2=80=99clock in the morning), and we=
 had gained many precious=20

minutes. At this time most of our cavalry was fighting dismounted, stubborn=
ly retiring. But the=20

Confederates at last realized that there was nothing but a brigade of dismo=
unted cavalry and a few=20

batteries of horse-artillery in their immediate front, and pushed forward g=
rimly and determinedly,=20

driving the dismounted troopers slowly ahead of them.  I had gone to the le=
ft of the road, and was=20

in a piece of woods with some of our cavalrymen (who by this time had been =
ordered to fall back=20

to their horses and give place to our infantry, which was then coming up), =
when a couple of rounds=20

of canister tore through=20


_
MRS. ALVING. You shouldn't sit so long at table, Oswald.  OSWALD. [Holding =
his cigar behind=20

him.] But I find it so pleasant, mother. [Strokes and caresses her.] Just t=
hink what it is for me to=20

come home and sit at mother's own table, in mother's room, and eat mother's=
 delicious dishes.=20

MRS. ALVING. My dear, dear boy!  OSWALD. [Somewhat impatiently, walks about=
 and smokes.]=20

And what else can I do with myself here? I can't set to work at anything.  =
MRS. ALVING. Why can't=20

you?  OSWALD. In such weather as this? Without a single ray of sunshine the=
 whole day? [Walks=20

up the room.] Oh, not to be able to work--!  MRS. ALVING. Perhaps it was no=
t quite wise of you to=20

come home?  OSWALD. Oh, yes, mother; I had to.  MRS. ALVING. You know I wou=
ld ten times=20

rather forgo the joy of having you here, than let you--  OSWALD. [Stops bes=
ide the table.] Now just=20

tell me, mother: does it really make you so very happy to have me home agai=
n?  MRS. ALVING.=20

Does it make me happy!  OSWALD. [Crumpling up a newspaper.] I should have t=
hought it must be=20

pretty much the same to you whether I was in existence or not.  MRS. ALVING=
. Have you the=20

heart to say that to your mother, Oswald?  OSWALD. But you've got on very w=
ell without me all=20

this time.  MRS. ALVING. Yes; I have got on without you. That is true.  [A =
silence. Twilight slowly=20

begins to fall. OSWALD paces to and fro across the room. He has laid his ci=
gar down.]  OSWALD.=20

[Stops beside MRS. ALVING.] Mother, may I sit on the sofa beside you?  MRS.=
 ALVING. [Makes=20

room for him.] Yes, do, my dear boy.  OSWALD. [Sits down.] There is somethi=
ng I must tell you,=20

mother.  MRS. ALVING. [Anxiously.] Well?  OSWALD. [Looks fixedly before him=
.] For I can't go on=20

hiding it any longer.  MRS. ALVING. Hiding what? What is it?  OSWALD. [As b=
efore.] I could never=20

bring myself to over my head. Riding back to the edge of the woods in the d=
irection from which the=20

shots came, I found myself within long pistol range of a section of a batte=
ry of light artillery. It was=20

in position near a country road that came out of another piece of woods abo=
ut two hundred yards=20

in its rear, and was pouring a rapid fire into the woods from which I had j=
ust emerged. As I sat on=20

my horse quietly watching it from behind a rail fence, the lieutenant comma=
nding the pieces saw=20

me, and, riding out for a hundred yards or more toward where I was, proceed=
ed to cover me with=20

his revolver. We fired together--a miss on both sides. The second shot was =
uncomfortably close,=20

so far as I was concerned, but as I took deliberate aim for the third shot =
I became aware that in=20

some way his pistol was disabled; for using both hands and all his strength=
 I saw that he could not=20

cock it. I had him covered, and had he turned I think I should have fired. =
He did nothing of the sort.=20

Apparently accepting his fate, he laid his revolver across the pommel of hi=
s saddle, fronted me=20

quietly and coolly, and looked me steadily in the face. The whole thing had=
 been something in the=20

nature of a duel, and I felt that to fire under the circumstances savored t=
oo much of murder.=20

Besides, I knew that at a word from him the guns would have been trained on=
 me where I sat. He,=20

too, seemed to appreciate the fact that it was an individual fight, and man=
fully and gallantly forbore=20

to call for aid; so, lowering and uncocking my pistol, I replaced it in my =
holster, and shook my fist=20

at him, which action he cordially reciprocated, and then, turning away, I r=
ode back into the woods.=20

About this time the enemy=E2=80=99s artillery ceased firing, and I again ro=
de rapidly to the edge of the=20

woods, just in time to see the guns limber up and retire=20


_
it; and since I've come home--  MRS. ALVING. [Seizes him by the arm.] Oswal=
d, what is the=20

matter?  OSWALD. Both yesterday and to-day I have tried to put the thoughts=
 away from me--to=20

cast them off; but it's no use.  MRS. ALVING. [Rising.] Now you must tell m=
e everything, Oswald!=20

OSWALD. [Draws her down to the sofa again.] Sit still; and then I will try =
to tell you.--I complained=20

of fatigue after my journey--  MRS. ALVING. Well? What then?  OSWALD. But i=
t isn't that that is=20

the matter with me; not any ordinary fatigue--  MRS. ALVING. [Tries to jump=
 up.] You are not ill,=20

Oswald?  OSWALD. [Draws her down again.] Sit still, mother. Do take it quie=
tly. I'm not downright=20

ill, either; not what is commonly called "ill." [Clasps his hands above his=
 head.] Mother, my mind is=20

broken down--ruined--I shall never be able to work again! [With his hands b=
efore his face, he=20

buries his head in her lap, and breaks into bitter sobbing.]  MRS. ALVING. =
[White and trembling.]=20

Oswald! Look at me! No, no; it's not true.  lieutenant in command saw me an=
d stopped. We=20

simultaneously uncovered, waved our hats to each other, and bowed. I have a=
lways thought he=20

was one of the bravest men I ever faced.  I rode back again, passing throug=
h our infantry line,=20

intending to go to the left and find the cavalry, which I knew would be on =
the flank somewhere.=20

Suddenly I became conscious that firing had ceased along the whole line.  I=
 had not ridden more=20

than a hundred yards when I heard some one calling my name. Turning, I saw =
one of the=20

headquarters aides, who came galloping up, stating that he had been hunting=
 for me for the last=20

fifteen minutes, and that General Sheridan wished me to report to him at on=
ce. I followed him=20

rapidly to the right on the wood path in the direction from which he had co=
me.  As soon as I could=20

get abreast of him I asked if he knew what the general wanted me for.  Turn=
ing in his saddle, with=20

his eyes fairly ablaze, he said: =E2=80=9CWhy, don=E2=80=99t you know? A wh=
ite flag.=E2=80=9D  All I could say was, =E2=80=9CReally?=E2=80=9D=20

He answered=20


_
again! Never!--never! A living death! Mother, can you imagine anything so h=
orrible?  MRS.=20

ALVING. My poor boy! How has this horrible thing come upon you?  OSWALD. [S=
itting upright=20

again.] That's just what I cannot possibly grasp or understand. I have neve=
r led a dissipated life--

never, in any respect. You mustn't believe that of me, mother! I've never d=
one that.  MRS.=20

ALVING. I am sure you haven't, Oswald.  OSWALD. And yet this has come upon =
me just the=20

same--this awful misfortune!  MRS. ALVING. Oh, but it will pass over, my de=
ar, blessed boy. It's=20

nothing but over-work. Trust me, I am right.  OSWALD. [Sadly.] I thought so=
 too, at first; but it isn't=20

so.  MRS. ALVING. Tell me everything, from beginning to end.  OSWALD. Yes, =
I will.  MRS.=20

ALVING. When did you first notice it?  OSWALD. It was directly after I had =
been home last time,=20

and had got back to Paris again. I began to feel the most violent pains in =
my head--chiefly in the=20

back of my head, they seemed to come. It was as though a hands; but nothing=
 else was said.  A=20

few moments more and we were out of the woods in the open fields. I saw the=
 long line of battle of=20

the Fifth Army Corps halted, the men standing at rest, the standards being =
held butt on earth, and=20

the flags floating out languidly on the spring breeze. As we passed them I =
noticed that the officers=20

had generally grouped themselves in front of the centre of their regiments,=
 sword in hand, and=20

were conversing in low tones. The men were leaning wearily on their rifles,=
 in the position of=20

parade rest. All were anxiously looking to the front, in the direction towa=
rd which the enemy=E2=80=99s line=20

had withdrawn, for the Confederates had fallen back into a little swale or =
valley beyond=20

Appomattox Court-house, and were not then visible from this part of our lin=
e.  We soon came up to=20

General Sheridan and his staff. They were dismounted, sitting on the grass =
by the side of a broad=20

country road that led to the Court-house. This was about one or two hundred=
 yards=20
