these men and the citizen soldiers whom Germany the other day sent forth to=
 defend their country=20

and their hearths. The soldier had a language of his own, polyglot as the e=
lements of the band,=20

and garnished with unearthly oaths: and the void left by religion in his so=
ul was filled with wild=20

superstitions, bullet charming and spells against bullets, the natural refl=
ection in dark hearts of the=20

blind chance which since the introduction of firearms seemed to decide the =
soldier's fate. Having=20

no home but the camp, he carried with him his family, a she wolf and her cu=
bs, cruel and=20

marauding as himself; and the numbers and unwieldiness of every army were d=
oubled by a train=20



of waggons full of women and children sitting on heaps of booty. It was not=
, we may guess, as=20

ministering angels that these women went among the wounded after a battle. =
The chiefs made=20

vast fortunes. Common soldiers sometimes drew a great prize; left the stand=
ard for a time and=20

lived like princes; but the fiend's gold soon found its way back to the giv=
er through the Jews who=20

prowled in the wake of war, or at the gambling table which was the central =
object in every camp.=20

When fortune smiled, when pay was good, when a rich city had been stormed, =
the soldier's life=20

was in its way a merry one; his camp was full of roystering revelry; he, hi=
s lady and his charger=20

glittered with not over-tasteful finery, the lady sometimes with finery str=
ipped from the altars. Then,=20

glass in hand he might joyously cry, "The sharp sword is my farm and plunde=
ring is my plough;=20

earth is my bed, the sky my covering, this cloak is my house, this wine my =
paradise;" or chant the=20

doggerel stave which said that "when a soldier was born three boors were gi=
ven him, one to find=20

him food, another to find him a comely lass, a third to go to perdition in =
his stead." But when the=20

country had been eaten up, when the burghers held the city stoutly, when th=
e money-kings=20

refused to advance the war kings any more gold, the soldier shared the mise=
ries which he=20

inflicted, and, unless he was of iron, sank under his hardships, unpitied b=
y his stronger comrades;=20

for the rule of that world was woe to the weak. Terrible then were the muti=
nies. Fearful was the=20

position of the commander. We cannot altogether resist the romance which at=
taches to the life of=20

these men, many a one among whom could have told a tale as wild as that wit=
h which Othello, the=20

hero of their tribe, won his Desdemona, in whose love he finds the counterc=
harm of his wandering=20

life. But what sort of war such a soldiery made, may be easily imagined. It=
s treatment of the people=20

and the country wherever it marched, as minutely described by trustworthy w=
itnesses, was literally=20

fiendish. Germany did not recover the effects for two hundred years.  A cen=
tury had passed since=20

the first preaching of Luther. Jesuitism, working from its great seminary a=
t Ingoldstadt, and backed=20

by Austria, had won back many, especially among the princes and nobility, t=
o the Church of Rome;=20

but in the main the Germans, like the other Teutons, were still Protestant =
even in the hereditary=20

domains of the House of Austria. The rival religions stood facing each othe=
r within the nominal=20

unity of the Empire, in a state of uneasy truce and compromise, questions a=
bout ecclesiastical=20

domains and religious privileges still open; formularies styled of concord =
proving formularies of=20

discord; no mediating authority being able to make church authority and lib=
erty of private=20

judgment, Reaction and Progress, the Spirit of the Past and the Spirit of t=
he Future lie down in real=20

peace together. The Protestants had formed an Evangelical Union, their oppo=
nents a Catholic=20

League, of which Maximilian, Elector of Bavaria, a pupil of the Jesuits, wa=
s chief. The Protestants=20

were ill prepared for the struggle. There was fatal division between the Lu=
therans and the=20

Calvinists, Luther himself having said in his haste that he hated a Calvini=
st more than a Papist.=20

The great Protestant princes were lukewarm and weak-kneed: like the Tudor n=
obility of England,=20

they clung much more firmly to the lands which they had taken from the Cath=
olics than to the faith=20

in the name of which the lands were taken; and as powers of order, naturall=
y alarmed by the=20

disorders which attended the great religious revolution, they were politica=
lly inclined to the Imperial=20

side. The lesser nobility and gentry, staunch Protestants for the most part=
, had shown no capacity=20

for vigorous and united action since their premature attempt under Arnold V=
on Sickingen. On the=20

peasantry, also staunch Protestants, still weighed the reaction produced by=
 the Peasants' war and=20

the excesses of the Anabaptists. In the free cities there was a strong burg=
her element ready to=20



fight for Protestantism and liberty; but even in the free cities wealth was=
 Conservative, and to the=20

Rothschilds of the day the cause which offered high interest and good secur=
ity was the cause of=20

Heaven.  The smouldering fire burst into a flame in Bohemia, a kingdom of t=
he House of Austria,=20

and a member of the Empire, but peopled by hot, impulsive Sclavs, jealous o=
f their nationality, as=20

well as of their Protestant faith--Bohemia, whither the spark of Wycliffism=
 had passed along the=20

electric chain of common universities by which mediaeval Christendom was bo=
und, and where it=20

had kindled first the martyr fire of John Huss and Jerome of Prague, then t=
he fiercer conflagration=20

of the Hussite war. In that romantic city by the Moldau, with its strange, =
half Oriental beauty, where=20

Jesuitism now reigns supreme, and St. John Nepemuch is the popular divinity=
, Protestantism and=20

Jesuitism then lay in jealous neighbourhood, Protestantism supported by the=
 native nobility, from=20

anarchical propensity as well as from religious conviction; Jesuitism patro=
nized and furtively aided=20

by the intrusive Austrian power. From the Emperor Rudolph II., the Protesta=
nts had obtained a=20

charter of religious liberties. But Rudolph's successor, Ferdinand II., was=
 the Philip II. of Germany=20

in bigotry, though not in cruelty. In his youth, after a pilgrimage to Lore=
tto, he had vowed at the feet=20

of the Pope to restore Catholicism at the hazard of his life. He was a pupi=
l of the Jesuits, almost=20

worshipped priests, was passionately devoted to the ceremonies of his relig=
ion, delighting even in=20

the functions of an acolyte, and, as he said, preferred a desert to an empi=
re full of heretics. He=20

had, moreover, before his accession to the throne, come into collision with=
 Protestantism where it=20

was triumphant, and had found in its violence too good an excuse for his bi=
gotry. It was inevitable=20

that as King of Bohemia he should attempt to narrow the Protestant libertie=
s. The hot Czech blood=20

took fire, the fierceness of political turbulence mingled with that of reli=
gious zeal, and at a council=20

held at Prague, in the old palace of the Bohemian kings, Martiniz and Slava=
ta, the most hated of=20

Ferdinand's creatures, were thrown out of a window in what was called good =
Bohemian fashion,=20

and only by a marvellous accident escaped with their lives. The first blow =
was struck, the signal=20

was given for thirty years of havoc. Insurrection flamed up in Bohemia. At =
the head of the=20

insurgents, Count Thurn rushed on Vienna. The Emperor was saved only by a m=
iracle, as=20

Jesuitism averred,--as Rationalism says, by the arrival of Dampierre's Impe=
rial horse. He suffered=20

a fright which must have made him more than ever prefer a desert to an=20

and offered to Frederic, Elector Palatine. Frederic was married to the brig=

Princess Elizabeth of England, the darling of Protestant hearts; other qual=
ifications for that crown=20

of peril he had none. But in an evil hour he accepted the offer. Soon his u=
nfitness appeared. A=20

foreigner, he could not rein the restive and hard mouthed Czech nobility, a=
 Calvinist and a pupil of=20

the Huguenots, he unwisely let loose Calvinist iconoclasm among a people wh=
o clung to their=20

ancient images though they had renounced their ancient faith. Supinely he a=
llowed Austria and the=20

Catholic League to raise their Croats and Walloons with the ready aid, so v=
aluable in that age of=20

unready finance, of Spanish gold. Supinely he saw the storm gather and roll=

 of the Empire, under=20
