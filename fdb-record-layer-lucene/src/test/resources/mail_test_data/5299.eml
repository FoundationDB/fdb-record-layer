Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission o=

ainst the wishes of the=20

relatives or next of kin of the deceased. Every interment is a concession o=
f the privilege which=20

cannot afterward be repudiated, and the purchaser=E2=80=99s title to the gr=
ound is fettered with the right of=20

burial.[501]  On the other hand, the right of the municipal or state author=
ities, with the consent of=20

the owner of the burial lot or in the execution of the right of eminent dom=
ain, to remove dead=20

bodies from cemeteries is well settled.[502]  After the right of burial has=
 once been exercised by=20

the person charged with the duty of burial, or where such person has consen=
ted to the burial by=20

another person, no right to the corpse remains except to protect it from un=
lawful interference.[503]=20

On the other hand, where a husband did not freely consent to the burial of =
his wife in a lot owned=20

by another person, it was held that a court of equity might permit him, aft=
er such burial, to remove=20

her body, coffin, and tombstones to his own lot, and restrain any person fr=
om interfering with such=20

removal.[504]  In Rhodes _v._ Brandt, 21 Hun, N. Y., 1, the defendant broug=
ht an action against=20

one Beelard to recover for services rendered by him, as a physician, in tre=
ating a child of Beelard=E2=80=99s=20

for a fracture of the thigh-bone, in which action Beelard set up malpractic=
e on the part of the=20



defendant as a defence. During the pendency of the action the child died an=
d was buried.=20

Subsequently Beelard, the father, acting under the advice of his counsel, d=
irected and allowed the=20

plaintiff, a physician, to cause the body of the child to be exhumed, and a=
 portion of the thigh-bone=20

to be removed, in order that it might be used in evidence on the trial of t=
he question of malpractice.=20

After the bone was removed, the body was returned to the grave. The defenda=
nt thereupon=20

caused the plaintiff to be arrested for unlawfully removing the body from t=
he grave contrary to the=20

provisions of the statute, and the plaintiff sued the defendant for malicio=
us prosecution. The Court=20

held that the plaintiff had not removed the body from the grave =E2=80=9Cfo=
r the purpose of dissection or=20

from mere wantonness,=E2=80=9D as these terms were used in the statute (3 R=
. S., 6th ed., 965), for=20

duties were inherited by=20

this country as part of the English common-law system in force at the time =
of the formation of the=20

republic of the United States. When a body has been buried, and the coroner=
 believes that an=20

inquest is necessary, he has power to disinter the body and hold an inquest=
, and he may direct a=20

post-mortem examination to be made, but after having done so he must cause =
the body to be=20

reinterred. It is now well settled that in holding such an inquest, and mak=
ing such an autopsy or=20

ority to employ, and it=20

is his duty to employ, professional skill and aid, and his contract will bi=
nd the county to pay a=20

reasonable compensation for the same.[506]  As will be seen below from a sy=
nopsis of the=20

statutes relating to this matter, many of the States have enacted statutes =
defining and prescribing=20

the duties of the coroner and other public officers in such cases. At an ea=
