again the brief message.  It never took Doctor Wells long to make a decisio=
n; the course of action=20

he determined on now he quickly put into execution. He reached for the tele=
phone and in a=20

moment was talking with Mr. Stevens, whose room was situated in Gannett Hal=
l.  "Mr. Stevens,"=20

he said, "I want you to go up to Holbrook's room and ask him to come over h=
ere immediately. I'd=20

like to have you stay with him until he starts."  Teeny-bits was not greatl=
y surprised when Mr.=20

Stevens came into his room a quarter of an hour after he had said good nigh=
t to him. When any=20

one was in trouble Mr. Stevens had a way of dropping round to see how he co=
uld help. Teeny-bits=20

_was_ surprised, however, when the English master delivered Doctor Wells' m=
essage. The first=20

thought that came into his mind was that Mr. Stevens had reported what he h=
ad seen and that=20

Doctor Wells was calling him to his office to request an explanation. Mr. S=
tevens may have read=20

his thought for he looked at Teeny-bits rather searchingly and said:  "I do=
n't know why Doctor=20

Wells wants to see you; I haven't talked with him since he returned except =
to answer the request=20

that has just been made. If you need me in any way, let me know."  That was=
 the second time the=20

English master had offered himself.  "I guess there isn't anything you can =
do," said Teeny-bits as=20

he picked up his hat and started out of the room. "I'll run over to the off=
ice and see what Doctor=20

Wells wants."  Teeny-bits' heart was pounding a little as he mounted the gr=
anite steps of "The=20

White House", as every one called Doctor Wells' home. It was always an impr=
essive thing to make=20

a call on Doctor Wells--and one calculated to make the blood run a little f=
aster, whatever the=20

errand. There was something about this summons, moreover, that gave it an u=
nusual quality, and=20

to Teeny-bits, who had passed through two experiences that evening, it seem=
ed to be a climax=20

that held for him vague and perhaps unpleasant possibilities. He rang the b=
ell and was ushered=20

immediately into Doctor Wells' study where the soft lamplight, the painting=
s on the walls and the=20

garnet-colored rugs, which harmonized with the mahogany furniture, gave an =
atmosphere of=20

dignity and refinement. One always carried himself with a certain feeling o=
f awe--at least every=20

member of the school did--in Doctor Wells' office. But there was no unpleas=
ant formality in Doctor=20

Wells' manner. He shook hands with Teeny-bits cordially, asked him to sit d=
own and came to the=20

point immediately.  "I received a letter in the mail to-day which has somet=
hing to do with you,=20

Holbrook. I thought you'd better see it immediately. It isn't a pleasant su=
bject and I want you to tell=20

me frankly what you know about it."  He handed over a sheet of paper on whi=
ch were three or four=20

lines of typewritten words. They were simple enough in their meaning, but T=
eeny-bits had to read=20

them twice before he completely grasped their import. There were two senten=
ces:       Holbrook=20

has the things that were stolen from the dormitories. He      keeps them hi=
dden under the floor in=20

his closet.  Teeny-bits' face became red with anger and mortification; he l=
ooked Doctor Wells=20

squarely in the eyes and said:  "Whoever sent you this, sir, wrote a lie! H=
e didn't dare to sign his=20

name!"  Doctor Wells never took his eyes from Teeny-bits' face, but the exp=
ression in them=20

underwent a slight change; it was as if he had been looking for something t=
hat he greatly wanted=20

to see--and suddenly had seen it.  "I believe in you, Holbrook," he said. "=
And I want you to know=20

that I sympathize with you as I would with any one else against whose hones=
ty a cowardly assault=20

has been made. One has to defend himself sturdily against such underhand at=
tacks. Have you=20

any enemies who might try to injure you in this way?"  "I don't know; I sho=
uldn't think that any one=20

in _this_ school would be mean enough to do it. Doctor Wells, I want you to=
 come over to my room=20

now, and let me prove that it's a lie."  "I'll be glad to," said the Head, =
"but we might as well wait a=20



few minutes until the lights-out bell rings. We don't need to advertise our=
 business to any of the=20

fellows in Gannett Hall."  For fifteen minutes Teeny-bits sat in the study =
with Doctor Wells; he=20

never remembered in detail what they talked about, but he had a vague memor=
y that it concerned=20

football and the game with Jefferson.  Gannett Hall was dark and quiet when=
 the Head and the=20

newcomer to the school stole softly up the stairs and stopped at Number 34 =
on the third floor.=20

Teeny-bits unlocked the door, reached in to switch on the electric lights a=
nd stood aside to let=20

Doctor Wells enter first. He followed and led the way directly to the close=
t where he kept his=20

clothes. Swinging open the door he looked down.  At first glance it seemed =
that the boards were=20

not in any way disturbed from their normal appearance, and Teeny-bits was a=
bout to speak when=20

his eyes fell on a groove at the point where the ends of two boards came to=
gether. He had=20

Cumberland mountain forms for a considerable distance at least, the eastern=
 boundary. I have=20

observed but three other particulars in which the strata of the _horizontal=
_ differ from those of the=20

_inclined_ limestone.  1. Its colour is not so strongly marked with the blu=
ish tinge.  2. It is not so=20

commonly penetrated with white veins of a semicrystallized carbonate of lim=
e; nor is it so=20

frequently associated with the _uneven_ fractured species.  3. Petrifaction=
s are oftener found in it.=20

I will here take the liberty to suggest, whether in our maps of geology, so=
me notice should not be=20

taken of this very important division in the limestone country. Such a divi=
sion exists _in fact_;=20

nature has made it; and if geology depends on nature for its only legitimat=
e inductions, there can=20

be no reason why a feature so prominent as this, should be overlooked. I sh=
all not undertake to=20

account for their difference: but would not every geological theorist consi=
der them as distinct=20

formations?[31]   _Cumberland Mountain._  The Cumberland mountain, which fo=
rms a part of this=20

dividing line, is itself a singular formation. It belongs to the class call=
ed "Table mountains." Its=20

width varies from a few miles, to more than fifty. Its height is not percep=
tibly different from that of=20

the Blue Ridge. It forms a circuit, in a shape somewhat resembling a half m=
oon. Winding to the=20

southwest, it keeps a course north of the Tennessee river, in some places n=
early parallel with it;=20

passes a few miles to the southeast of Huntsville in the Alabama Territory,=
 and not long after=20

terminates. At one part, over which I crossed, the mountain is eighteen mil=
es wide. This is about=20

150 miles southwest of Knoxville, a little north of the 35th degree of N. L=
at. I had not ascended the=20

mountain more than halfway, before I found sandstone begin to intermingle w=
ith limestone strata.=20

As I drew near the summit, the limestone disappeared entirely, and sandston=
e prevailed in=20

abundance, with no other mineral associated until I reached the western des=
cent, where I met bold=20

precipices of horizontal limestone, reaching from the base to the summit. I=
 examined several=20

sandstone rocks while crossing the mountain, found them usually imbedded in=
 the earth, generally=20

with flat surfaces, of a fine grain, and strong texture. The colour is usua=
lly a reddish brown, or=20

grayish red. The specimen which you have received is a good example. I cros=
sed this mountain in=20

the vicinity of Huntsville, not less than one hundred miles southwest of th=
e place above-

mentioned, and found it not wider than mountains commonly are. Its height h=
ad also become less,=20

and horizontal limestone in regular strata prevailed in every part.  Althou=
gh this mountain forms a=20

part of the dividing line which has been mentioned, it does not exclusively=
 so: for the Rackoon=20

mountain, which crosses the Tennessee river, at the place so well known by =
the name of "the=20

Suck," and the Look-Out mountain, which terminates abruptly about 6 miles t=
o the left of "the=20

Suck," form an acute angle with the Cumberland, and are composed of horizon=
tal strata of=20



limestone. Thus it would appear the line which divides the two kingdoms of =
this rock, is nearly=20

north and south, inclining perhaps a few points to the east and west.   _Sc=
enery_.  And here I=20

cannot forbear pausing a moment to call your attention to the grand and pic=
turesque scenery=20

which opens to the view of the admiring spectator. The country is still pos=
sessed by the=20

aborigines, and the hand of civilization has done but little to soften the =
wild aspect of nature. The=20

Tennessee River, having concentrated into one mass, the numerous streams it=
 has received in its=20

course of three or four hundred miles, glides through an extended valley wi=
th a rapid and=20

overwhelming current, half a mile in width. At this place, a group of mount=
ains stand ready to=20

dispute its progress. First, the "Look-Out," an independent range, commenci=
ng thirty miles below,=20

presents, opposite the River's course, its bold and rocky termination of tw=
o thousand feet. Around=20

its brow is a pallisade of naked rocks, from seventy to one hundred feet. T=
he River flows upon its=20

base, and instantly twines to the right. Passing on for six miles further i=
t turns again, and is met by=20

the side of the Rackoon mountain. Collecting its strength into a channel of=
 seventy yards, it severs=20

the mountain, and rushes tumultuously through the rocky defile, wafting the=
 trembling navigator at=20

the rate of a mile in two or three minutes. This passage is called "The Suc=
k." The summit of the=20

Look-Out mountain overlooks the whole country. And to those who can be deli=
ghted with the view=20

of an interminable forest, penetrated by the windings of a bold river, inte=
rspersed with hundreds of=20

verdant prairies, and broken by many ridges and mountains, furnishes in the=
 month of May, a=20

landscape, which yields to few others in extent, variety or beauty. Even th=
e aborigines have not=20

been insensible to its charms; for in the name which they=20


_
would discover anything in the closet, but now suddenly a great fear came o=
ver him.  "There's a=20

mark on this board," he said, getting down closer, "and the nails have been=
 pulled out."  A minute=20

or two later Teeny-bits and Doctor Wells had pried up the loose boards with=
 a heavy paper-knife=20

from Teeny-bits' table and were gazing down at a small pile of loot which c=
onsisted of the objects=20

that various members of the school had reported as lost. It included Fred H=
arper's silver sailing=20

trophy, Ned Stillson's gold knife, Snubby Turner's watch and ten or a dozen=
 other trinkets. Teeny-

bits felt stunned. Doctor Wells had picked out the articles one after anoth=
er before Teeny-bits=20

found his voice. Then he said:  "I don't know what you think, Doctor Wells,=
 but the honest truth is=20

that I didn't know a thing about this. I can't even guess--"  He could say =
no more; his voice broke a=20

little and he felt as if he were half a dozen years younger and about to cr=
y in little-boy manner.=20

"Teeny-bits," said Doctor Wells--it was the second time that night that Fin=
dley Holbrook had been=20

thus addressed by a person in authority at Ridgley--"I've said once that I =
believe in you; this=20

doesn't shake my confidence in your honesty. I'll take charge of these thin=
gs; I think you'd better=20

go to bed now and let me see what I can do to solve the problem. I'll borro=
w this empty laundry=20

bag."  After Doctor Wells had gone, Teeny-bits undressed and got into bed, =
but for hours he did=20

not fall asleep. He kept thinking of Snubby Turner climbing down the fire e=
scape. Could it be=20

possible that the genial Snubby was guilty of stealing from his friends, of=
 professing to have lost=20

property himself and finally of attempting to throw the blame on another? I=
t seemed unbelievable.=20

But why had Snubby stayed away from the mass meeting except to break into t=
he rooms of his=20

classmates? It was all too confusing. Teeny-bits could evolve no satisfacto=
ry explanation. At two=20

or three in the morning he fell into a troubled sleep during which he dream=
ed that he was playing=20

in the Jefferson game and that the stands were yelling in a tremendous chor=
us:  "He's a _thief_;=20

he's a _thief_!"     CHAPTER VII  ON THE EVE OF THE STRUGGLE   On the morni=
ng after the=20

discovery of the loot hidden under the floor of the closet at 34 Gannett Ha=
ll Teeny-bits awoke with=20

the feeling that he had been experiencing a nightmare in which disaster and=
 unhappiness had=20

fastened a death-like clutch upon him. It scarcely seemed possible that tho=
se events with which=20

the evening had been crowded were real.  The speech at the mass meeting, th=
e discovery of=20

Snubby Turner sliding down the side of the fire rope and have a laconic, bu=
t very striking=20

description of the scenery. This name in the Cherokee language, without the=
 aspirated sounds, is=20

"O-tull-ton-tann=C3=A2-t=C3=A2-kunn=C3=A2-;" literally, "mountains looking =
at each other."  I have already remarked=20

that the limestone of this mountain lies in horizontal strata: one mile eas=
t from its base it is=20

inclined. Like the Cumberland, it contains immense rocks of sandstone, but =
of a coarser grain,=20

verging occasionally into pudding stone. I was told by a white man, a profe=
ssed millwright, that=20

among these sandstone rocks, he knew of many which were suitable for millst=
ones. At the=20

missionary establishment, called "Brainerd," eight miles east of the mounta=
in, I saw one of them=20

which was used for this purpose to much advantage. It is composed of fine a=
nd large grains of=20

silicious stones, nearly white, and resembling pebbles of white quartz: the=
 texture is firm.=20

_Silicious Minerals, &c._  I will now notice an important fact, applicable =
to the whole extent of=20

limestone country, which has come under my observation. It is its associati=
on with a description of=20

minerals, all of which appear to be _silicious_. To describe them minutely,=
 would require several=20

pages. From the time I entered the limestone country till I left it this as=
sociation was observed. The=20

minerals included in it differ much in their external character. Their size=
 varies from that of rocks to=20



the smallest fragments. Usually they lie loose upon the earth, in angular f=
orms, having the=20

appearance of a stone that has been broken in pieces by the hammer. Sometim=
es they cover the=20

sides of hills and mountains in such abundance as to prevent or impede vege=
tation. When the=20

disintegration is minute, they are serviceable rather than otherwise; and t=
he farmer talks of his=20

"good black," or "white gravel land." It renders this service, I presume, n=
ot by decomposition, but=20

by preventing the soil and its manure from being washed away. Indeed the di=
fferent varieties of it=20

are generally scattered over the surface, in pieces so small, that for conv=
enience sake, the whole=20

may be denominated a _silicious gravel_.  Sometimes the mineral is imbedded=
 in limestone, in the=20

form of nodules, thus indicating their original connexion with it.  The var=
ieties, so far as I have=20

observed, are quartz, hornstone, flint, jasper, and semi-opal; and several,=
 which to me are non-

descripts. _Quartz_ is the most abundant. It is found of different colours;=
 compact, and porous or=20

cellular; of every size; simple and associated with other silicious stones;=
 massive and crystallized.=20

In Augusta and Rockbridge counties in Virginia, beautiful crystals of quart=
z, of a singular form, are=20


_
incident with Mr. Stevens, the summons to Doctor Wells' office, the visit t=
o Gannett Hall and the=20

astounding secret that revealed itself when the boards of the closet were l=
ifted,--all those events=20

seemed like strange imaginings. Teeny-bits jumped from bed and opened the d=
oor of the closet.=20

The little marks that he and Doctor Wells had made with the paper-knife wer=
e sufficient evidence=20

to bring back the reality of each incident and to plunge Teeny-bits into a =
gloomy perplexity from=20

which not even the crisp brightness of the November day or the prospect are=
 six-sided prisms,=20

with double acuminations, that is, with six-sided pyramids, mounted on the =
opposite ends of the=20

prism. A specimen of two such crystals united, you have received. It was fo=
und near Lexington. A=20

curious variety of the quartz gravel-stone occurs on both sides of Elk Rive=
r, a few miles above its=20

junction with the Tennessee, in the Alabama territory. As you travel to the=
 west from Huntsville, it=20

appears first in the neighbourhood of Fort Hampton, two miles east of Elk R=
iver, and may be seen=20

for ten miles west of that river. The mineral=20
