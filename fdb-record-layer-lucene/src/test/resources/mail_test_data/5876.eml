h researches. The=20

essay published by M. Cuvier and him, upon the geology of the environs of P=
aris, has afforded an=20

example of their use.  He has laboured since this period to apply this meth=
od to other formations,=20

which contain the relics of organized bodies; but he stands in need of much=
 assistance, and he=20

presumes to ask it, not only of naturalists, but even of all persons intere=
sted in the sciences. By=20

means of the following instructions, he endeavours to avail himself of the =
kindness of persons the=20

least conversant in the discrimination of fossils.  1. To collect all the f=
ossil organized bodies which=20

can be obtained; especially _the distinguishable impressions and remains of=
 vegetables_ from=20

coal countries, and beds of wood, coal, and others. The _shells_, _crustace=
=C3=A6_, _madrepores_,=20

_fishes_, &c. It is not necessary that these bodies should be either large =
or entire, but they must=20

be sufficiently characterized to be capable of being recognized.  It is use=
less to transmit large=20

unmeaning pieces, which are recommended only by their size--such as large a=
mmonites--large=20

madrepores--large pieces of petrified wood--fragments of the one, or small =
individuals of the other,=20

are often sufficient. We may avoid also collecting the inner moulds ("des m=
oules interieurs") of=20

shells, because they are almost invariably incapable of being recognized.  =
2. Petrifactions, isolated=20



and detached from their rock, are the most convenient in the determination =
of species; but when=20

they cannot be separated from the rock, we need not hesitate to send them e=
ngaged; it is=20

sufficient if a portion large enough for discrimination is visible.  Among =
shells, those are preferable=20

which have the mouth or hinge in view; among madrepores, those on whose sur=
face the figures=20

(les =C3=A9toiles) are distinguishable; among vegetables, those whose leave=
s are distinctly expanded,=20

(expalm=C3=A9es.)  3. Upon the objects transmitted it is desirable to have,=
 at least in part, the following=20

notices:  1. The exact place from which the object comes: this is the most =
important circumstance,=20

and the easiest to obtain.  2. The kind of formation in which it is found, =
and a specimen of the=20

stratum, or at least of the rock, which contained it. It is desirable that =
this rock exhibit remains of=20

petrifactions similar to those found in the stratum from which it has been =
drawn.  3. The nature of=20

of as many of the=20

o designate, by the same=20

mark, all the petrifactions _unquestionably_ found in the same stratum, or =
at least in the same=20

formation. The specimens ought to be almost square--about three inches or m=
ore on a side, and=20

one and a half thick.  5. It is equally important not to mix petrifactions =
found in different formations,=20

or in different strata of the same formation; or if they are packed togethe=
r, to distinguish them by=20

numbers, marks, or labels.  When the preceding notices cannot be obtained, =
the first will suffice.=20

In order to collect the petrifactions, and to render them useful, it is not=
 necessary to know them,=20

nor to be perplexed to find them out; nor to be afraid of sending objects a=
lready known or of little=20

note. A part of the preceding indications, connected with the most common p=
etrifactions, will=20

always render them useful. The important point then is, not to mix those wh=
ich are found separate,=20

nor to separate those which are found associated in the same stratum.  This=
 is easily attained, by=20

designating by a common number, letter, or any sign whatever, one particula=
r formation or=20

stratum, and by marking with the same sign all the petrifactions which are =
evidently found=20

together.  The labels designating the place or the geological situation, ma=
y be placed in the papers=20

which envelope the specimens, or a number, referring to an explanatory cata=
logue, may be=20

attached to each specimen.  As far as possible, it is necessary to stick th=
e labels or numbers to=20

the pieces, by pasting; and the surest way is, to write upon the piece itse=
lf, 1st, the place where it=20

is found; 2d, the number by which it is indicated in the historical notes a=
bove requested.  If there is=20

not time to make out as many numbers or labels as there are pieces, it will=
 be sufficient to unite in=20

one box or packet all the petrifactions of one particular stratum, and to d=
esignate them by a=20



general label.  It is necessary to pack the shells and other fragile pieces=
 in separate boxes, and to=20

Limosella, recently discovered in the United States, by Dr. Eli Ives, Profe=
ssor of Materia Medica=20

and Botany, in the Medical Institution of Yale College._   This small plant=
 was observed in flower in=20

July, 1816, by Mr. Horatio N. Fenn (now of Rochester, State of New-York) in=
 company with Dr.=20

Leavenworth. The plant and the seeds have been preserved by me, in a flower=
-pot, from that time=20

to the present. The plant was taken a few rods south of Mr. Whitney's gun m=
anufactory, on the=20

margin of the river, where it was covered by every tide. I have since obser=
ved the plant in great=20

abundance on the margin of the Housatonuck, in Derby, and in those small st=
reams in East=20

Haven, Branford, and Guilford, which empty into Long-Island Sound.  A speci=
men of the limosella=20

(with some specimens of the tillea) was sent to Z. Collins, Esq. of Philade=
lphia, who wrote me that=20

Mr. Nuttall had found the same plant, a few days previous to the receipt of=
 my letter, and that they=20

had no question on the subject of the generic character, but that it would =
probably prove to be a=20



new species.  In the transactions of the Medico-Physical Society of New-Yor=
k, page 440, it is=20

described under the name of limosella subulata. A description of the plant =
was published about the=20

same time, by Mr. Nuttall, in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Science=
s of Philadelphia. (See=20

Vol. I. No. 6. p. 115.)  In the paper written by Mr. Nuttall is the followi=
ng query: "Does this plant,=20

with a lateral mode of growth and alternate leaves, germinate with two coty=
ledons?" The following=20

observations were made in answer to this question. In the winter of 1816-17=
 this plant was kept in=20

a situation exposed to severe frost; yet whenever the weather became warm f=
or two or three days,=20

it became quite green, but for the last winter there was no appearance of l=
ife in the plant. In March=20
