their cabins and prepared their evening's meal. Having finished this, the religious among them 

would gather at one of the cabin doors and give thanks to God in the form of long supplications 

and old fashioned songs. Many of them being highly emotional would respond in shouts of 

hallelujahs sometimes causing the entire group to become "happy" concluding in shouting and 

praise to God. The wicked slaves expended their pent up emotions in song and dance. Gathering 

at one of the cabin doors they would sing and dance to the tunes of a fife, banjo or fiddle that was 

played by one of their number. Finished with this diversion they would retire to await the dawn of a 

new day which indicated more work. The various plantations had white men employed as "patrols" 

whose duties were to see that the slaves remained on their own plantations, and if they were 

caught going off without a permit from the master, they were whipped with a "raw hide" by the 

"driver." There was an exception to this rule, however, on Sundays the religious slaves were 

allowed to visit other plantations where religious services were being held without having to go 

through the matter of having a permit.   Religion. There was a free colored man who was called 

"Father James Page," owned by a family of Parkers of Tallahassee. He was freed by them to go 

and preach to his own people. He could read and write and would visit all the plantations in 

Tallahassee, preaching the gospel. Each plantation would get a visit from him one Sunday of each 

month. The slaves on the Randolph plantation would congregate and have not charity, I am 

become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and 

understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove 

mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.... Charity never faileth; but whether there be 

prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be 

knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that 

which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away." Clearly the writer of this 

believes in prophecies, in tongues, in mysteries. But clearly, also, he regards them as both 

secondary and transient, while he regards charity as primary and eternal.  It may be added that 

the advent of spiritual life did at once produce a change in the character of the miraculous itself, 

divested it of its fantastic extravagance, and infused into it a moral element. The Gospel miracles, 

almost without exception, have a moral significance, and can without incongruity be made the text 

of moral discourses to this day. An attempt to make Hindoo or Greek miracles the text of moral 

discourses would produce strange results.  Compared with the tract of geological, and still more 

with that of astronomical time, spiritual life has not been long in our world; and we need not 

wonder if the process of disengagement from the environments of the previous state of humanity

that was converted, or rather that changed his religious allegiance, sometimes by treaty (as in the 

case of Guthrum), and carried his tribe with him into the allegiance of the new God. Hence the 

new religion, like the old, was placed upon the footing of a tribal, and afterwards of a state,
