this being solely at the merchant's risk.  The "Calzada," or public drive, =
is a broad neat carriage=20

road, leading round the outer face of the outer ditch, from the bridge, rou=
nd the land and sea faces=20

of the fortifications to the river. It is planted with trees, and forms a g=
ood drive, having roads=20

leading from it into the country, whose rich and cultivated appearance give=
s the stranger a high=20

opinion of its fertility. The roads are however much in want of waterings i=
n dry weather, the dust of=20

the principal one being at these times insufferable.  On the road leading t=
o the village of Santa=20

Anna is the cemetery, [133] a building well worth the attention of stranger=
s both as a novelty in=20

itself, and as in some measure redeeming the character of the architecture =
of this country from its=20

general want of interest and symmetry.  It consists of two concentric circu=
lar walls, about ten feet=20

apart and fourteen in height, both surmounted with a balustrade. The inner =
wall forms the=20

periphery of a circle of about 250 feet in diameter, and is pierced with th=
ree rows of small=20

semicircular arches, which form the entrances to as many arched, oven-like =
receptacles, formed in=20

the space betwixt the walls, and of a size just calculated to receive a cof=
fin, to which purpose they=20

are appropriated.  There are from two to three hundred of those receptacles=
; and when occupied,=20

the entrances are walled up. The plot of ground in the centre is crossed by=
 two broad stone walks,=20

the borders of which are planted with flowers and shrubs; the remaining spa=
ce is used for=20

interments.  On the further side from the gate, and joined to the wall, is =
a handsome chapel of an=20

oval shape, the roof being a dome. The interior of this chapel is remarkabl=
y neat; and the altar,=20

which is white, and gold, is particularly so, from its elegant simplicity a=
nd chasteness of ornament:=20

on each side of it are repositories for the remains of governors and bishop=
s.  Without are flights of=20

steps leading to the terrace joining the walls, and two passages leading to=
 a smaller building at the=20

back of the chapel, and in the same style as the large one. This is called =
the "Angelorio" and a=20

recess in it the "Ossario." The first is appropriated to the remains of inf=
ants and children, and the=20

last to the bones which may in time accumulate. This purpose suggests the o=
nly objection which is=20

apt to arise in viewing the building, which is, that, as in the course of t=
ime the receptacles must be=20

filled up, those which have been first occupied must be opened, and the bon=
es displaced to and=20

Pliny stand by the old Greek; and it is quite probable that Shakespeare acq=
uired his idea from one=20

of the three. And these, with Anaxagoras, are but little out of the way; fo=
r as seen in the discussion=20

of volcanic action, the explosive or disturbing agent is generally steam, t=
hough other gases are=20

present in large quantities.  We have already noticed that earthquakes and =
volcanoes are=20

produced by the same causes; but as the myths of many nations do not connec=
t the two, it is=20

evident that such people did not recognize their essential identity.  But a=
fter knowing they are but=20

variations in results, we cannot so readily explain the reason of the varia=
tions. Certain facts are=20

well established; and from these common premises widely different conclusio=
ns have been=20

deduced.  We know to-day that in active volcanic regions, an earthquake alm=
ost invariably=20

precedes an eruption; and a violent one has never, within the historic peri=
od, followed an eruption.=20

So the most reasonable inference is, that the earthquake merely betokens th=
e presence of a vast=20

quantity of imprisoned vapor which has not found an outlet; and that so soo=
n as a volcanic vent is=20

found, the pressure is relieved, and the earthquake subsides.  But this lea=
ves us just where the=20

theorists of volcanic agency have stopped. The question of the sudden forma=
tion of volumes of=20

gases in sufficient quantities to produce such terrible effects is to be so=
lved.  Mr. Mallet, who is=20

one of the best authorities on the subject, considers that submarine erupti=
ons must account for=20



them. A volcanic upheaval of the sea bottom would produce crevices, by whic=
h the sea is brought=20

directly in contact with subterranean fires. An explosion is the result, li=
ke those that have=20

occasionally occurred at foundries from dumping masses of fiery slag into a=
 snowbank. So what=20

began with a gradual upheaval ends with a sudden concussion, the vibration =
of which passes=20

along the sea bottom to the mainland. Every one who has lived in the city i=
s familiar with the fact=20

that the vibration produced by a carriage may be felt at the top of a very =
tall building.  But the idea=20

that the explosion always occurs at the sea bottom leaves no way to account=
 for the fact that a=20

volcanic eruption acts as a safety-valve. Mr. Mallet=E2=80=99s conclusions =
are largely based on personal=20

observations of earthquakes in England, where no active volcano exists.  Th=
at earthquakes are=20

more violent and volcanoes more numerous on islands or near the sea coast i=
s well-known. It is=20

also well established that shocks frequently occur=20


_
objection, and would appear to indicate a dulness of feeling and want of se=
ntiment, which, though=20

far from being uncommon at Manila, by no means accords with the spirit and =
style in which the=20

building is executed, or with the reflections it is apt to excite.  There a=
re no other buildings in the=20

neighbourhood of Manila worthy the attention of the stranger. The appearanc=
e of the surrounding=20

country is rich, and in some parts highly cultivated; but an air of neglect=
 and dilapidation is visible=20

throughout, which strikingly marks the apathetic character of both classes =
of its inhabitants. It is=20

remarkable, too, that the neatness of the native villages, and the apparent=
 comfort of the people,=20

increase in direct proportion to their distance from the capital, as the in=
fluence of government is=20

less felt, and the Indian, knowing no other authority than the "Padre," ret=
ains more of his original=20

character.  The vices of Spanish colonies have been often the theme of thos=
e who have visited=20

them; and when speaking of Manila, they have seldom exaggerated. [134] It h=
as been observed,=20

and with some justice, that "to know the education of the children, is to k=
now the character of a=20

people." If this be true, but little can be said for Manila, where this hig=
hly important duty is more=20

neglected than perhaps in any civilized part of the globe.  The majority of=
 the young are=20

abandoned entirely to the Indian servants, who soon familiarize them with a=
ll that is vicious. They=20

know but little of their parents more than as the master and mistress of th=
e house, whose hand=20

they must kiss, kneeling, every morning and evening. By five The shock is s=
imilar to that produced=20

by striking on a reef. Often have sailors been mystified, on receiving such=
 shocks and hastily=20

heaving the lead, to find the ocean unfathomable. Again, shocks which are m=
ost violent on land=20

are not perceptible at sea, unless a great sea wave be produced; but such a=
 wave in the open=20

sea, as often experienced, produces no shock but passes under a vessel like=
 a heavy swell. And a=20

shock at sea is sometimes severe enough to snap a spar, or wrench loose bol=
ts like the blow of a=20

reef, yet no trace is perceptible on shore. Lastly, earthquakes often happe=
n in inland regions, and=20

affect but a small area. Clearly it will not do to attribute effects so dif=
ferent to explosions at the sea-

bottom.  Those who attribute all earthquakes to subterranean heat and gases=
, whether local or=20

general, find it easy to account for the occurrence of violent earthquakes =
in regions remote from=20

active volcanoes. In case of the gradual decline of volcanic action, such a=
s we know from the=20

great numbers of extinct volcanoes, old trap-dykes, and ancient lava beds, =
to be continually taking=20

place in one region or another, the old vents or safety-valves would cool a=
nd close. The pent up=20

power would in consequence gradually accumulate, till finding no outlet, it=
 would burst the crust=20

over a wide area, and so relieve the pressure.  This finds further confirma=
tion in the fact that the=20

noted non-volcanic regions which are seriously shaken are all coincident wi=
th or adjacent to=20

regions of extinct fires; while in such regions as are very seldom shaken, =
such as Germany,=20

portions of North America, Brazil, the=20


_
moonlight, abuse the Indians, and not unfrequently their parents. At 12 the=
y are debauched. At 18=20

or 20 they marry, and then form the citizens for which such an education ha=
s prepared them. They=20

are seldom or ever taught any useful employment or profession. This the maj=
ority of them would=20

look upon with the utmost contempt: "Soy gracias a Dios, de sangre noble," =
[135] is their reply to=20

any advice of this kind; and this is a passport to a cadetship in the army =
or colonial marine; which,=20

though attained at the age of 12 or 13, seldom slope of the Andes, the trac=
es of such agency are=20

less common, or of older date. Noted regions of volcanic action of comparat=
ively recent extinction=20

are Asia Minor, Turkey, Spain, Southern France and Greece. These, belted to=
gether by the active=20

regions of Western Asia, the peninsula of Arabia, the Mediterranean, and Az=
ores and Canaries,=20

form a region which has suffered from earthquakes as much as, if not more t=
han, any other tract=20

upon the globe.  Those who have been puzzled by the appearance of earthquak=
es some distance=20

from any=20


_
any vice unlearnt. The girls are educated nearly in the same manner, as far=
 as to the acquirement=20

of any useful knowledge. They are sent to the nunneries till 12 or 14 years=
, and from thence=20

married. Of household duties they know little or nothing, and of any thing =
else, still less.  The=20

manner of living is nearly as follows: The gentlemen rise about six or seve=
n, and take chocolate.=20

They then lounge earthquakes into two classes, which they have called volca=
nic and plutonic. This=20

second class they have considered as originating, like the other, in the de=
pths of the earth; but=20

have endeavored to account for them by supposing them to be occasioned by t=
he falling in of=20

great caverns at a considerable depth. This theory has found a fair objecti=
on in the fact that in=20

such cases an earthquake should=20
