 2  It is some time since Charudatta age of thirty-five.  The Pleiade serve=
d literature by their attention to form, by their skill in poetic instrumen=
tation; but they were incapable of interpreting life in any large and origi=
nal way. In the hands of their successors poetry languished for want of an =
inspiring theme. PHILIPPE DESPORTES (1546-1606) was copious and skilful in =
his reproduction and imitation of _
fat on my mistress' rice-cakes saw him, stumbled with his left foot over a =
gambler's score, grabbed=20

up an iron pole out of a shop, and challenged the mad elephant--  _Vasantas=
ena._ Go on! Go on!=20

_Karnap._      I hit him--in a fit of passion, too--       He really looked=
 like some great mountain=20

peak.     And from between those tusks of his I drew       The sacred hermi=
t meek.=20

20  _Vasantasena._ Splendid, splendid! But go on!  _Karnapuraka._ Then, mis=
tress, all Ujjayini=20

tipped over to one side, like a ship loaded unevenly, and you could hear of=
 JOACHIM DU BELLAY=20

shines with a ray which, if less brilliant than that of Ronsard, has a fine=
r and more penetrating=20

influence. Du Bellay was born about 1525, at Lire, near Angers, of an illus=
trious family. His youth=20

was unhappy, and a plaintive melancholy haunts his verse. Like Ronsard he s=
uffered from=20

deafness, and he has humorously sung its praises. _Olive_, fifty sonnets in=
 honour of his Platonic=20

or Petrarchan mistress, Mlle. de Viole (the letters of whose name are trans=
posed to Olive),=20

appeared almost at the same moment as the earliest _Odes_ of Ronsard; but b=
efore long he=20


_
hurrah for Karnapuraka!" Then, mistress, a man touched the places where he =
ought to have=20

ornaments, and, finding that he hadn't any, looked up, heaved a long sigh, =
and threw this mantle=20

over me.  [41.19. S.  _Vasantasena._ Find out, Karnapuraka, whether the man=
tle is perfumed with=20

jasmine or not.  _Karnapuraka._ Mistress, the elephant perfume is so strong=
 that I can't tell for=20

sure.  _Vasantasena._ Then look at the name.  _Karnapuraka._ Here is the na=
me. You may read=20

it, mistress. [_He hands her the mantle._]  _Vasantasena._ [_Reads._] Charu=
datta. [_She seizes=20

the mantle eagerly and wraps it about her._]  _Madanika._ The mantle is ver=
y becoming to her,=20

Karnapuraka.  _Karnapuraka._ Oh, yes, the mantle is stanzas the fantasies a=
nd excesses of the=20

Petrarchan style. It was not until his residence in Rome (1551) as intendan=
t of his cousin Cardinal=20

du Bellay, the French ambassador, that he found his real self. In his _Anti=
quites de Rome_ he=20

expresses the sentiment of ruins, the pathos of fallen greatness, as it had=
 never been expressed=20

before. The intrigues, corruption, and cynicism of Roman society, his broke=
n health, an=20

unfortunate passion for the Faustina of his Latin verses, and the longing f=
or his beloved province=20

and little Lire depressed his spirits; in the sonnets of his _Regrets_ he e=
mbodied his intimate=20

feelings, and that lively spirit of satire which the baseness of the Pontif=
ical court summoned=20


_
_Vasantasena._ Here is your reward, Karnapuraka. [_She gives him a gem._]  =
_Karnapuraka._=20

[_Taking it and bowing low._] Now the mantle is most wonderfully becoming. =
 _Vasantasena._=20

Karnapuraka, where is Charudatta now?  _Karnapuraka._ He started to go home=
 along this very=20

street.  _Vasantasena._ Come, girl! Let us go to the upper balcony and see =
Charudatta.=20

already shown itself in his mocking counsel to _le Poete courtisan_: the co=
urtier poet is to be a=20

gentleman who writes at ease; he is not to trouble himself with study of th=
e ancients; he is to=20

produce only pieces of occasion, and these in a negligent style; the rarer =
and the smaller they are=20

the better; and happily at last he may cease to bring forth even these. Pos=
sibly his _poete=20

courtisan_ was Melin de Saint-Gelais. As a rural poet Du Bellay is charming=
; his _Jeux=20

only less admirable than the _Vanneur de Ble_, with which more than any oth=
er single poem the=20

memory of Du Bellay is associated. The personal note, which is in general a=
bsent from the poetry=20

of Ronsard, is poignantly and exquisitely audible in the best pieces of Du =
Bellay. He did not live=20

long enough to witness the complete triumph of the master;=20
