"By all the Celestyals!" he ejaculated, jerking forth a six-shooter--"by all the roarin', screechin, shriekin', yowlin', squawkin,' ring-tailed, flat-futted cattymounts thet  Mr. Beecher would answer heartily: "Fine!  Don't see how you grow them. All that my trees bear is a crop of scale.  Still, the blossoms are beautiful in the spring, and I like an apple-leaf.  Ever examine one?"

burly "tough" winning all the time, his pile of tens steadily increasing in hight.  "Talk about Joner 

an' the ark, an' Noar an' ther whale!" he cries, slapping another X onto the pile with great 

enthusiasm; "I hed a grate, grate muther-in-law w'at played keerds wi' Noar inside o' thet 

eyedentical whale's stummick--played poker wi' w'alebones fer pokers. They were afterward 

landed at Plymouth rock, or sum uther big rock, an' fit together, side by side, in the rebellyuns." 

"Indeed!"--with an amused laugh--"then you must have descended from a long line of respected 

ancestors."  "Auntsisters? Wa'al, I jest about reckon I do. I hev got ther blood o' Cain and Abel in 

my veins, boyee, an' ef I ken't raise the biggest kind o' Cain tain't because I ain't _able_--oh! no. 

Pace anuther pilgrim?"  "I reckon. How much have ye got piled up thar in that heap!"  "Squar' 

ninety tens, my huckleberry, an' all won fa'r, you bet."  "Then it's the first time you ever won

"Never skirt a market," the latter said; "always go through it.  It's the next best thing, in the winter,
