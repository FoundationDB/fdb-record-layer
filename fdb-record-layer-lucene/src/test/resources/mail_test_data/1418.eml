Then whence are ye? They answered, From the land of Canaan, and our father =
is Jacob, the=20

prophet of God. He said, And hath he sons beside you? They answered, Yea: w=
e were twelve; but=20

the youngest of us went away, and perished in the desert, and he was the de=
arest of us unto him;=20

and his uterine brother remained, and he retained him that he might console=
 himself thereby for=20

the loss of the other._[236] _And Joseph gave orders to lodge them, and to =
treat them=20

generously._ And when he had furnished them with their provision, _and give=
n them their full=20

measure_, he said, Bring me your brother from your father, _namely, Benjami=
n, that I may know=20

your veracity in that ye have said_. Do ye not see that I give full measure=
, and that I am the most=20

hospitable of the receivers of guests? But if ye bring him not, there shall=
 be no measuring _of=20

corn_ for you from me, nor shall ye approach me.--They replied, We will sol=
icit his father for him,=20

and we will surely perform _that_. And he said unto his young men, Put thei=
r money,[237] _which=20

they brought as the price of the corn_, in their sacks, that they may know =
it when they have=20

returned to their family: peradventure they will return _to us; for they wi=
ll not deem it lawful to keep=20

it_.--And when they returned to their father, they said, O our father, the =
measuring [of corn] is=20

denied us _if thou send not our brother unto him_; therefore send with us o=
ur brother, that we may=20

obtain measure; and we will surely take care of him. He said, Shall I intru=
st you with him otherwise=20

than as I intrusted you with his brother _Joseph_ before? But God is the be=
st guardian, and He is=20

the most merciful of those who show mercy.--And when they opened their good=
s, they found their=20

money had been returned unto them. They said, O our father, what desire we =
_of the, generosity=20

of the king greater than this?_ This our money hath been returned unto us; =
and we will provide=20

corn for our family, and will take care of our brother, and shall receive a=
 camel-load more, _for our=20

brother_. This is a quantity easy _unto the king, by reason of his munifice=
nce_.--He said, I will by=20

no means send him with you until ye give me a solemn promise by God that ye=
 will assuredly bring=20

him back unto me unless _an inevitable and insuperable impediment_ encompas=
s you. _And they=20

complied with this his desire._ And when they had given him their solemn pr=
omise, he said, God is=20

witness of what we say. _And he sent him with them_; and he said, O my sons=
, enter not _the city=20

of Misr_ by one gate; but enter by different gates; _lest the_ [evil] _eye =
fall upon you_.[238] But I=20

shall not avert from you,  The south of France, in contact with Italy, with=
 the cultured Moors of=20

Spain, and, through its Mediterranean ports, with the most advanced civiliz=
ation then known, that=20

of the Arabs, was far in advance of the northern provinces in civilization,=
 or at least in luxury and=20

knowledge of the arts usually accompanying civilization. Provence, especial=
ly, with its ancient port=20

of Marseilles to recall memories of the most cultured nation of antiquity, =
was in material prosperity=20

and in arts already advancing to that stage of civilization which was to ma=
ke her, in the course of=20

the next century, the mother of the first real literature France had known =
and of the first extended=20

protest against the Church of Rome. The troubadours were soon to make Prove=
nce and the=20

Provencal tongue famous, and the Albigenses, with their heresy, were to inv=
ite the destruction of=20

this gay, brilliant, but unsound society. The south was already far more ga=
y and pleasure loving=20

than the north, where the ravages of wars foreign and domestic had been mor=
e terrible. And out of=20

the south came Queen Constance, _la Blanche_, to a court where the king was=
 more monk than=20

king.  The northerners, always disliking the men of Provence, exclaimed in =
horror against the=20

manners and the costume of the horde of Provencal attendants whom Constance=
 brought with=20

her. "The favor of the queen," says Glaber, "attracted into France and Bour=
gogne many natives of=20



Aquitaine and Auvergne. These vain and frivolous men showed themselves to b=
e as ill-regulated=20

in their morals as they were immodest in their dress. Their armor and the f=
urnishings of their=20

horses were extraordinary. Their hair fell scarce to the middle of their he=
ads (the fashion of=20

shaving the back of the head was strange in northern France, though afterwa=
rd so prevalent that=20

William's Norman knights were reported by Harold's spies to be all shaven-c=
rowned monks); they=20

shaved their beards off as smooth as play actors; they wore boots indecentl=
y turned up in long=20

points at the toes, robes cut off short, reaching to the knees and divided =
behind and before; in=20

walking they hopped along!" Alas for France! the French and the Burgundians=
, formerly the most=20

honest and sober of all nations, eagerly followed the "sinful example" set =
by the queen's favorites.=20

The whole nation copied these indecent costumes, and short hair, short robe=
s, and sinfully pointed=20

shoes became the fashion. As the Puritans inveighed against Babylonish appa=
rel, the livery of the=20

"scarlet woman," in the shape of Cavalier curls and long plumes, so the div=
ines of France made a=20

crusade against this livery of the devil. They=20


_
to befall you_ from God: _I only say this from a feeling of compassion._ Ju=
dgment belongeth not=20

[unto any] save unto God _alone_. On Him do I rely, and on Him let those re=
ly who rely.  And=20

when they entered as their father had commanded them, _separately_, it did =
not avert from them=20

anything _decreed to befall them_ from God, but [only satisfied] a desire i=
n the soul of Jacob,=20

which he accomplished; _that is, the desire of averting the_ [evil] _eye, a=
rising from a feeling of=20

compassion:_ and he was endowed with knowledge, because We had taught him: =
but the greater=20

number of men, _namely the unbelievers_, know not _God's inspiration of His=
 saints_. And when=20

they went in unto Joseph, he received unto him (_or pressed unto him_) his =
brother. He said,=20

Verily I am thy brother;[239] therefore be not sorrowful for that which the=
y did _from envy to us_.=20

_And he commanded him that he should not inform them, and agree with him th=
at he should=20

employ a stratagem to retain him with him._ And when he had furnished them =
with their provision,=20

he put the cup, _which was a measure made of gold set with jewels_,[240] in=
 the sack of his=20

brother _Benjamin_. Then a crier cried, _after they had gone forth from the=
 chamber of that the=20

pointed shoes would infallibly carry their wearers to the realm of the mast=
er whose livery they=20

wore. One can hear the very voice of Ben Jonson's Ananias, the Puritan, as =
he testifies against=20

the costume of the Spaniard: "They are profane, lewd, superstitious, and id=
olatrous breeches."=20

Nevertheless, the satanic livery was never utterly thrown aside; and clothe=
s were not the only=20

things satanic about the new queen. Constance, high-tempered and energetic,=
 reigned over=20

France through or in spite of King Robert. Coming of a forceful and warlike=
 race, she must have=20

found many things distasteful in the weakness and superstition which were t=
he chief traits she=20

noted in her husband. She and her kinsfolk left him free to compose hymns, =
while they ruled=20

France. But when one of his favorites, Hugues de Beauvais, whom he had made=
 count of the=20

palace, suggested to Robert that he might get rid of Constance and send for=
 the ever-regretted=20

Bertha, Constance notified her strenuous uncle Foulques. Foulques promptly =
despatched a dozen=20

brave knights, with orders to slay Hugues whenever and wherever they found =
him: they found him=20

and murdered him in the very presence of the king. Robert was too weak to r=
esist=20


_
surely thieves. They said (and turned unto them), What is it that ye miss? =
They answered, We=20

miss the king's measure; and to him who shall bring it [shall be given] a c=
amel-load _of corn_, and=20

I am surety for it, _namely the load_. They replied, By God! ye well know t=
hat we have not come to=20

act corruptly in the land, and we have not been thieves. _The crier and his=
 companions said_,=20

Then what shall be the recompense of him _who hath stolen it_, if ye be lia=
rs _in your saying, We=20

have not been thieves,--and it be found among you?_ They answered, His reco=
mpense [shall be=20

that] he in whose sack it shall be found _shall be made a slave:_ he, _the =
thief_, shall be=20

compensation for it; _namely, for the thing stolen. Such was the usage of t=
he family of Jacob._=20

Thus do We recompense the offenders _who are guilty of theft.--So they turn=
ed towards Joseph,=20

that he might search their sacks._ And he began with their sacks, _and sear=
ched them_ before the=20

sack of his brother [Benjamin], _lest he should be suspected_. Then he took=
 it forth (_namely, the=20

measure_) from the sack of his brother. Thus, _saith God_, did We contrive =
a stratagem for=20

Joseph. It was not [lawful] for him to take his brother _as a slave for the=
ft_ by the law of the king of=20

_Egypt_ (_for his recompense by his law was beating, and a fine of twice th=
e value of the thing=20

stolen; not the being made a slave_), unless God had pleased, _by inspiring=
 him to inquire of his=20

brethren and inspiring them to reply according to their usage_. We exalt un=
to degrees [of=20

knowledge and honour] whom We please, _as Joseph_; and [there is who is] kn=
owing above=20

every one [else] endowed with knowledge.--They said, If he steal, a brother=
 of his hath stolen=20

before; _namely, Joseph;[241] for he stole an idol of gold belonging to the=
 father of his mother,=20

and broke it, that he might not worship it._ And Joseph concealed it in his=
 mind, and did not=20

discover it to them. He said _within himself_, Ye are in a worse condition =
more to religious=20

devotions.  He used to go to the church of Saint-Denis and sing with the ch=
oir and challenge the=20

singers to a trial of skill. When Constance one day asked him to compose so=
me song in her honor,=20

he responded with a stave of his hymn: _O! Constantia martyrum_ (O! faith a=
nd constancy of the=20

martyrs), with which she was as well pleased as if the reference had not be=
en a bit ambiguous. On=20

a certain occasion, as he was besieging a castle on the feast of Saint Hipp=
olytus, to whom he=20

professed a special devotion, he left the army and repaired to Saint-Denis =
to sing hymns in honor=20

of the saint. While he was thus engaged, the walls of the castle fell, and =
the king's troops entered=20

in; a manifest reward for his singing _Agnus Dei, dona nobis pacem!_ While =
he was one day at=20

prayers, shedding many tears, as was his wont, the vain and worldly-minded =
Constance adorned=20

his lance with silver ornaments. The king, finding this sinful waste, looke=
d out of his door and saw=20

a poor man near by. He sent him off to get some sort of tool to cut off the=
 decorations, shut himself=20

up in a room with the fellow, stripped the lance of its silver gewgaws, and=
 gave them to him,=20

bidding him begone in haste lest the queen see him. Constance asked what ha=
d become of the=20

silver, and Robert "swore by the Lord's name, though not in earnest," that =
he knew not what had=20

become of it.  In spite of this pious perjury, we are told that Robert had =
a great horror of lying. The=20

proof of this statement is very interesting. He had a reliquary made of cry=
stal, set in a golden case,=20

and containing no relic. Upon this his nobles, ignorant of the deceit, coul=
d swear without danger of=20

risking their souls, in case the oath was false. And as common folk had sou=
ls, too, and might=20

endanger them by false swearing, he had a similar reliquary, made of silver=
, in which was=20

deposited nothing more sacred than an egg. He was constantly endeavoring to=
 shield the petty=20

malefactors whom his=20


_
Joseph and his brother, by reason of your having stolen your brother from y=
our father and your=20

having treated him unjustly_; and God well knoweth what ye state _concernin=
g him_.--They said,=20

O prince, verily he hath a father, a very old man, _who loveth him more tha=
n us, and consoleth=20

himself by him for the loss of his son who hath perished, and the separatio=
n of him grieveth him_;=20

therefore take one of us _as a slave_ in his stead; for we see thee [to be =
one] of the beneficent.=20

He replied, God preserve us from taking [any] save him in whose possession =
we found our=20

property; for then (_if we took another_), we [should be] unjust.  And when=
 they despaired of=20

[obtaining] him, they retired to confer privately together. The chief of th=
em _in age_ (_namely,=20

Reuben, or in judgment, namely, Judah_), said, Do ye not know that your fat=
her hath obtained of=20

you a solemn promise in the name of God, _with respect of your brother_, an=
d how ye formerly=20

failed of your duty with respect to Joseph? Therefore I will by no means de=
part from the land _of=20

Egypt_ until my father give me permission _to return to him_, or God decide=
 for me _by the=20

delivery of my brother_; and He is the best, _the most just_, of those who =
decide. Return ye to=20

your father, and say, O our father, verily thy son hath committed theft, an=
d we bore not testimony=20

_against him_ save according to that which we knew _of a certainty, by our =
seeing the cup in his=20

sack_; and we were not acquainted with what was unseen _by us when we gave =
the solemn=20

promise: had we known that he would commit theft, we had not taken him. And=
 send thou_, and=20

ask _the people of_ the city in which we have been (_namely, Misr_)[242] an=
d the company of=20

travellers with whom we have arrived (_who were a people of Canaan_): and w=
e are surely=20

speakers of truth.--_So they returned to him, and said unto him those words=
_. He replied, Nay,=20

your minds have made a thing seem pleasant unto you, _and ye have done it_ =
(_he suspected=20

them, on account of their former conduct in the case of Joseph_); but patie=
nce is seemly:=20

peradventure God will bring them back (_namely, Joseph and his brother_) un=
to me, together; for=20

He is the Knowing _with respect to my case_, the Wise _in His acts_. And he=
 turned from them,=20

and said, O! my sorrow for Joseph! And his eyes became white in consequence=
 of mourning, and=20

he was Constance would have punished. It was his habit to have the poor fed=
 from his table, and=20

on one occasion he had a fellow concealed under the table at his feet. The =
man found time=20

between bites to cut off a heavy gold ornament attached to the king's knee.=
 "What enemy of God,=20

my good lord, has dishonored your gold-adorned robe?" cried Constance. "Und=
oubtedly," said=20

Robert, "he who took it wanted it more than I, and with God's aid it will b=
e of service to him." One=20

day he saw a young clerk named Ogger steal a candlestick from the altar in =
his chapel. The=20

priests were much disturbed over its loss; and the queen, in a rage, swore =
by the soul of her father=20

that she would have the eyes of the priests torn from their sockets if they=
 did not account for what=20

had been stolen from the sanctuary. The priests questioned Robert, who, den=
ying all knowledge of=20

the theft, at once sent for the thief. "Friend Ogger," said he, "haste thee=
 hence, lest my inconstant=20

Constancy eat thee up. What thou hast taken will be enough to carry thee to=
 thy own country. The=20

Lord be with thee." When the thief was beyond danger of pursuit, Robert che=
erfully said: "Why all=20

this pother about a candlestick? The Lord has given it to some of his poor.=
"  One can well=20

understand that however churchmen might commend this sort of meekness it wa=
s most irritating to=20

Constance. She was full of energy and vigor, and never jested, says her bio=
grapher, about=20

anything. She and her uncle Foulques, whom Robert had made governor of Pari=
s, ruled France=20

and fought against the turbulent and rebellious barons, chief among whom wa=
s Eudes II., Count of=20



Blois, of Chartres, of Tours, and of Champagne, the son of the deposed quee=
n, Bertha. She led in=20

the first important attack upon heresy. Certain clerks in the city of Orlea=
ns developed a secret,=20

heretical sect which gained many proselytes, among others a certain Etienne=
, who had been the=20

confessor of Queen Constance. Their secret was discovered; they were brough=
t to trial, refused to=20

recant, and were ordered to execution. As they marched from the church wher=
e they had been=20

tried to the immense funeral pyre, they passed Constance in the porch of th=
e church. Recognizing=20

Etienne among the thirteen prisoners, she attacked him furiously, and with =
a whip put out one eye=20

of the defenceless victim. This vindictive queen, aggravating the=20


_
silent grief. They said, By God, thou wilt not cease to think upon Joseph u=
ntil thou be at the point=20

of death, or be of [the number of] the dead. He replied, I only complain of=
 my great and=20

unconcealable grief and my sorrow unto God; _not unto any beside Him; for H=
e it is unto whom=20

complaint is made with advantage_; and I know [by revelation] from God what=
 ye know not;=20

_namely, that the dream of Joseph was true, and that he is living_. _Then h=
e said_, O my sons, go=20

and seek news of Joseph and his brother; and despair not of the mercy of Go=
d; for none=20

despaireth of the mercy of God except the unbelieving people.  _So they dep=
arted towards Egypt,=20

unto Joseph_; and when they went in unto him, they said, O Prince, distress=
 (_that is, hunger_)=20

hath affected us and our family, and we have come with paltry money (_it wa=
s base not a pleasant=20

figure in French.  As Robert grew older and it became necessary to determin=
e on a successor,--

the right of the oldest son was not yet altogether fixed,--Constance began =
to intrigue against her=20

husband. Robert was in the habit of saying: "My hen pecks, but she gives me=
 plenty of chickens."=20

They had had six children; but had lost their eldest son, Hugues, in 1025. =
Of the three remaining=20

sons, Eudes, the eldest, was an idiot; Henry, the second, was his father's =
choice; and Robert, the=20

youngest, was favored by Constance, "with her habitual spirit of contradict=
ion." She said, with=20

some reason, that Henry was weak, inactive, deceitful, and negligent of aff=
airs, and could no more=20

be king than his father could; whereas Robert had far more energy and sense=
 than his brothers.=20

For once, the king resisted, and with the=20
