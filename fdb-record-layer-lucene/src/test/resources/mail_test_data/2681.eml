taken from the translations of old Arab poetry contributed by Mr. C. J. Lya=

One day when Guillem had gone off hawking alone Margarida saw Raymond hide =
his sword under=20

his cloak and follow after Guillem. She waited in fearful anxiety till they=
 returned, Raymond=20

apparently in good humor with Guillem and all the world. Raymond told her t=
hat he had discovered=20

who was the lady of Guillem's songs. Margarida's terror may be imagined. "I=
 knew," said=20

Raymond, "that no one could sing so well unless he loved. When I conjured h=

which is a treasury of Arab life, and abounds in those anecdotes which reve=
al more of the=20

character of the people than whole volumes of ethnological treatise.  [8] T=
he later Arabic poets=20

were mostly incapable of the genius of the old singers: the times had chang=
ed, and the ancient=20

poetry appeared almost as exotic to their ideas as it does to our own. No g=
reater mistake can be=20

made than to judge of the old poets by such a writer as Beha-ed-deen Zoheyr=
, of whom Professor=20

E. H. Palmer has lately given us so beautiful a version. There is nothing i=

 The following is an=20

abridgment: cp. Muir 485, and the _Seeret-er-Rasool_, tr. Weil, ii. 316, 31=
7.  [17] An attempt has=20

been made to explain away Mohammad's fidelity to Khadeejeh, by adducing the=
 motive of=20

pecuniary prudence. Mohammad, they say, was a poor man, Khadeejeh rich and =
powerfully=20

connected; any _affaire de c[oe]ur_ on the husband's part would have been f=
ollowed by a divorce=20

and the simultaneous loss of property and position. It is hardly necessary =
to point out that the fear=20

of poverty--a matter of little consequence in Arabia and at that time--woul=
d not restrain a really=20

sensual man for five-and-twenty years; especially when it is by no means ce=
rtain that Khadeejeh,=20

who loved him with all her heart in a motherly sort of way, would have proc=
ured a divorce for any=20

cause soever. And this explanation leaves Mohammad's loving remembrance of =
his old wife=20

unaccounted for. If her money alone had curbed him me at first, but at leng=
th confessed that it was=20

your sister, Lady Agnes de Tarascon." He then told her that it was all true=
, moreover, for he had=20

ridden to the Chateau de Tarascon with Guillem, and that, after some hesita=
ncy, the Lady Agnes=20

had admitted that Guillem was her lover. Margarida was at first dumfounded,=
 and completely=20

incredulous; but her husband's statements were so exact that she was finall=
y convinced of=20

Guillem's faithlessness.  At their first private interview she taxed him wi=
th his ingratitude, and=20

would scarcely listen to his denials. Guillem told her that, seeing himself=
 forced into a corner by=20

Raymond's persistent questions, he had named the Lady Agnes in desperation,=
 to prevent=20

immediate discovery and death. The Lady Agnes and her husband, whom she had=
 told of the=20

intrigue, soon confirmed the lover's story. Lady Agnes had seen the distres=
s in Guillem's=20

countenance when Raymond brought him to Tarascon and asked her, in his pres=
ence, who was=20

her lover. To save Guillem and her sister, Lady Agnes had admitted that Gui=
llem was her lover,=20

and she and her husband had done all in their power to convince Raymond of =
this fact. One need=20



hardly remark on the social conditions or the general laxity of morals impl=
ied in the naive recital of=20

such an incident.  To continue Margarida's story, the lovers were reconcile=
d and Guillem=20

celebrated the reconciliation in a song. Unfortunately he had grown rash, a=
nd alluded too openly in=20

this song to the very circumstances of their case. "No man," he sang, "suff=
ers greater martyrdom=20

than I; for you, whom I desire more than aught in this world, I must disavo=
w and deny, and lie as if=20

no love were in my heart. Whate'er I do through fear of my life, you must t=
ake in good faith, even=20

though you do not see why I do it." This song, some portions of which were =
violently amorous,=20

came to the hands of Raymond. He guessed the truth at once, and planned an =
awful vengeance.=20

Some days later, as the husband and wife were seated at dinner, the Lady Ma=
rgarida commented=20

on the delicacy of a bit of deer's heart which she had eaten. "Do you know,=
" said Raymond, "what=20

you have been eating?" "No, but I found it delicious." "This will show you,=
" he said, raising before=20

her the bloody head of Guillem Cabestanh. "Behold the head of the man whose=
 heart you have=20

just eaten!" The lady fainted at the horrible sight, and when she recovered=
 screamed aloud that=20

the heart she had eaten was so good and savory that never more would she ea=
t meat. The=20

maddened husband rushed at her with drawn sword, and she, to escape death a=
t his hands, cast=20

herself out of a window and was dashed to pieces.  The story has a little s=
equel, not less=20

instructive and enlightening in its way. "The news of the deed spread rapid=
ly, and was received=20

everywhere with grief and indignation; and all the=20


_
twenty-five years, one would expect him at her death to throw off the cloak=
, thank Heaven for the=20

deliverance, and enter at once upon the rake's progress. He does none of th=
ose things. The story=20

of Zeyneb, the divorced wife of Zeyd, is a favourite weapon with Mohammad's=
 accusers. It is not=20

one to enter upon here; but I may say that the lady's own share in the and =
the lady, and all the=20

courteous knights of the neighborhood, and all those who were lovers, unite=
d to make war against=20

Raymond." King Alphonso of Arragon invaded Raymond's dominions, took him pr=
isoner, kept him=20

in captivity the rest of his days, and divided his property among the relat=
ives of the murdered=20

lovers. The unhappy pair he caused to be buried in=20


_
considered. In all probability Zeyd, the freed slave, was glad enough to ge=
t rid of his too well-born=20

wife, and certainly he bore no rancour against Mohammad. The real point of =
the story is the=20

question of forged revelations, which is discussed below. once a year came =
all the knights and all=20

the fond lovers of Roussillon, Cerdagne, and Narbonnais, to pray for the so=
uls of Guillem=20

Cabestanh and the fair Lady Margarida. In the glamor of romance, morality a=
nd common decency=20

are apt to be lost sight=20


_
[18] 'The Prophet said: Whosoever shall bear witness that there is one God;=
 and that Mohammad=20

is His servant and messenger; and that Jesus Christ is His servant and mess=
enger, and that he is=20

the son of the hand-maid of God, and that he is the Word of God, the word w=
hich was sent to=20

Mary, and Spirit from God; and [shall bear witness] that there is truth in =
Heaven and Hell,=20

sympathies for the guilty Paolo and Francesca of this story, while Raymond,=
 the miserable=20

husband, meets with captivity and the loss of his property. We may add that=
 the main facts of this=20

story are confirmed, even to the episode of the heart, by several accounts =
in manuscripts, though=20

imagination is doubtless responsible for certain details.  In the loves of =
