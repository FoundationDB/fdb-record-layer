s public road. Have some respect for me. You ought not to say such things, =
nor I to hear."  He looked at her, wondering. "Is it any want of respect to=

caressingly. "There, there, my pretties! Go to bed again."  He lifted the g=
lass cover of the chest=20

and dropped them into its interior. There was a great hissing and rustling.=
 The hermit stepped to=20

the hanging lamp and turned the shade so as to send the radiance of it into=
 that corner. Through=20

the pane Ruth saw a squirming mass of scaly bodies, mixed up with an old qu=
ilt. More than one=20

tail, with rows of "buttons" and rattles on it, was elevated, and one angry=
 serpent "sprung his rattle"=20

sharply.  "Hush, hush, my dears!" said the hermit, soothingly. "Go to sleep=
 again now. My=20

children," he said, nodding at Ruth. "Pretty dears!"  To tell the truth, th=
e girl from the Red Mill=20

wanted to scream; but she held herself down, clenching her hands, and sayin=
g nothing. The kettle=20

began to sing and she was glad to go back to the chair by the fire and afte=
rward to sip the tin cup=20

of hot tea that their host gave her, and eat with good appetite a square of=
 the crisp cornbread.=20

Meanwhile, the hermit took from the walls three pairs of great, apologetic-=
-reluctant to say it,--and=20

yet it seemed necessary to say it. There were many people whom she might ha=
ve met on the road=20

to whom she would not have mentioned the fact, but it seemed incumbent upon=
 her now.  "Going=20

away! No, that you must not do--you must not do it! Why should you go away?=
" he cried.  "There=20

are many reasons." Nora felt that she ought to laugh at his vehemence, or t=
hat, perhaps, she=20

should be angry; but she was neither the one nor the other--only apologetic=
, and so sorry for him.=20

"Of course I always knew I should have to go: though I shall always think i=
t home here, yet it is not=20

home any longer. It is a great pity, don't you think, to live so long in a =
place which, after all, is not=20

your home?"  "I cannot think it a great pity that you should have lived her=
e," he said. "The thing is,=20

that you must not go. For God's sake, Nora, do not go! I never thought of t=
hat; it is the last drop. If=20

you knew how near I am to the end of my strength, you would not speak of su=
ch a thing to me."=20

"Lord Rintoul! I--don't=20


_
to them. The pair he selected for Ruth looked to the girl to be so big that=
 she never could take a=20

step in them; but he seemed to expect her to try.  They went out of the cab=
in as the moon was=20

rising. It came up as red and fiery as the sun had gone down. Long shadows =
of the tall trees were=20

flung across the snow. The hermit commanded Rose, the setter, to guard the =
hut, while he allowed=20

the hound to follow at heel. He carried his rifle, and Ruth was glad of thi=
s.  "Haven't heard a cat-o'-

mountain around here this winter," he said, as they started up the hill. "D=
idn't hear nor see one at=20

all last winter. Neighbors will have to get up a hunt for this one that her=
 confusion. She felt that she=20

should have taken a different tone. He had no right to call her Nora, or to=
 speak as if he had=20

anything to do with her coming or going. But the hurried tone of passion an=
d terror in his voice=20

overwhelmed her. It was as if he had heard of the last misfortune that coul=
d overwhelm a man.=20

"Matter! Do you mean to me? It may not matter to any one else; to me it is =
everything," he said,=20

wildly. "I shall give in altogether. I shall not care what I do if you go a=
way."  "Now, Lord Rintoul,"=20

said Nora, her heart beating, but trying to laugh as she best could, "this,=
 you must know, is=20

nonsense. You cannot mean to make fun of me, I am sure;=20


_
At the top of the ascent they stopped and the old man put on Ruth's snowsho=
es for her. Fred,=20

always without a word and looking mighty sullen (but evidently afraid of th=
e rattlesnake man) tied=20

his own in place and the hermit slipped into his and they each gave Ruth a =
hand.  She stood up=20

and found that her weight made little or no impression upon the better say =
no more about it." Then=20

she melted again. She remembered their last interview, which had gone to he=
r heart. "I know," she=20

said, "that you have been in a great deal of trouble."  "You know," said Ri=
ntoul, "because you feel=20

for me. Nobody else knows. Then think what it will be for me if you go away=
--the only creature=20

whom I dare to speak to.=20
