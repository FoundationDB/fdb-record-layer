We had nobody present to enter into the required bonds; the extent of the r=

quantity, and the vagabond was set loose.  As he parted from us, he put his=
 finger to his nose, and=20

whistled a bar of "Hail Columbia." He picked out a fusee from his pocket, t=
hen lit his cigar, and,=20

with a degree of speed compatible with an air of mock stateliness, the blac=
kguard walked down to=20

k into the water. They=20

struggled to regain the vessel; those who succeeded clung to guns, tackling=
, spars and masts; but=20

twenty were drowned. The vessel lay with her keel to the sea and nearly her=
 entire hull out of=20

water; so those who clung to the rigging were fairly protected.  During the=
 day the natives=20

succeeded in getting a line to the wreck, and a number of the sailors escap=
ed. But the line parted=20

while some were still on the vessel, and could not be replaced. The remaind=
er of the crew clung to=20

the wreck through all that terrible day and night, and were finally gotten =
off when at the verge of=20

exhaustion.  While the _Adler_ was drifting toward the reef, the _Nipsic_ w=

odds. Facing the wind, she was  [Illustration: THE ADLER ON THE REEF.]  nev=

It was impossible to resist the mortification of seeing the blackguard slip=
 through our hands, as we=20

thought we had him effectually in our grasp.  We did not return to the cons=

Majesty. We stayed only about another hour in France to refresh ourselves, =
as there was a vessel=20

then about to start for England, and we were desirous of getting home.     =

There is a moral to this story which politicians may relish; and I am there=
fore about to add material=20

out of which a Member of Parliament might make a reputation. I have disguis=
ed the names and=20

localities of the actors in this little international mercantile drama. It =
may, however, be worth while=20

to add, that the facts are substantially and--with the specific exceptions =
I name--literally correct. If=20

any Member of Parliament or noble lord wants the real name and address of t=
he consul, I am at=20

liberty to give it; if he wants the real names of any other actors in this =
little drama, I can and am at=20

liberty to supply them.  On our return homewards we discussed the conduct o=
f the consul--our own=20

consul--in this affair. We were led to doubt the propriety of his taking th=
at money from us. We=20

suspected that he wanted had crippled the two vessels already wrecked, thre=
atened to crush her=20

also. While the _Nipsic_ endeavored by skillful use of steam and rudder to =
avoid the _Olga_, a=20

little schooner, the _Lily_, fell in her way and was cut down in an instant=
. There were but three=20

men on board; two of whom succeeded in reaching the _Olga_.  Just then it o=
ccurred to the=20

commander of the _Nipsic_ to reinforce the anchors by attaching a hawser to=
 one of the heavy=20

eight-inch rifles and casting it overboard. Ere this was accomplished the _=
Olga_ struck her a=20

terrible blow directly amidships. Her smoke-stack was overturned and fell o=
n the deck with a=20

terrible crash. One of her boats was carried away and the rail splintered. =
No one at first knew the=20

extent of the damage. The frightened crew clambered into the rigging, think=
ing the ship was=20

sinking. The lumbering smoke-stack dashed from side to side with the roll o=
f the ship.  It was a=20

frightful moment. Only a few yards away the _Eber_ had disappeared. The _Ni=
psic_ had swung=20

around and was rapidly nearing the spot. Only promptness and most skillful =
management saved=20

her officers and crew from the fate of the _Eber_.  Captain Mullane was on =
the bridge at the time,=20

and took in the situation=20


_
the French police any fees, but to put in his own pocket. We thought that, =
if our suspicions were=20

accurate, the conduct of the consul was scandalous.  I made inquiries. In a=
 letter from the=20

commissary of police I was informed that the French officers were not permi=
tted to take fees, and=20

that not one sou had been paid to a gendarme out of the 20_l._ taken from u=
s. By direction of the=20

French local authorities, proceedings against the British consul were taken=
 in a local court. He=20

disputed the jurisdiction of the French tribunals. He set up his consulship=
 in bar of the suit. On this=20

purely technical point--the merits of the case being taken from under the c=
ontrol of the court--an=20

appeal went up to a court of appeal. The consul's plea in bar of jurisdicti=
on was held to be a good=20

one. The French judges held that the defrauded person being an Englishman, =
and the alleged=20

offender being an English consul, the remedy was by an application to the F=
oreign Office in=20

London. Memorials, setting forth all the merits or demerits of the case, an=

miscarriage of justice in the French courts, accompanied by newspaper repor=

and in an instant. With the smoke-stack gone it would be impossible to keep=
 up steam; without=20

steam the reef could not be avoided. At once the smoke-stack was chocked to=
 prevent its rolling=20

about the deck, and orders were given to beach the ship while a small head =
of steam was still=20

available. Two hundred yards away lay the sandy beach before the American c=
onsulate.  A great=20

throng awaited anxiously the result of this man=C5=93uvre. The vessel=E2=80=
=99s course was parallel to the=20

terrible reef, and but a few feet from it. Her crew were gathered about the=
 bow, and those on shore=20

recognized many a familiar face or personal friend in the driving spray, on=
 whom they might be=20

looking for the last time. One or two of the crew had been on shore during =
the night, and now=20

stood watching the fate of their comrades.  Barely escaping the reef, the s=
teamer plunged into the=20

sand a few yards from the shore, and swung around diagonally to the storm. =
The breakers dashed=20

furiously upon her stern, and it seemed as though she would be beaten to pi=
eces in an instant.=20

Those who escaped must do so at once.  Five sailors dashed into a boat; but=
 the falls did not work=20

properly, and one=20
