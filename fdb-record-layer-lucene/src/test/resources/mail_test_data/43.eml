philodendron monstera of the little rick like a glowing python that wraps its prey in its embrace. Another gust of wind, and the flame leapt joyously up to the pinnacle of the rick, and sent forth other tongues to lick and think it is not so cold as it was, and the wind is quite gone.  They have been away five days now, or more.  I think that God, in His mercy, will send us relief in the morning."  "You are a goot lass, philodendron monstera of the little rick like a glowing python that wraps its prey in its embrace.

watch him, fell back as he advanced, torch in hand. They knew exactly what he was going to do, 

they had thought it all out, planned it, spoken of it till even their unimaginative minds had 

visualised this coming scene with absolutely realistic perception. And yet, now that the supreme 

hour had come, now that they saw Pierre--torch in hand--prepared to give the signal which would 

set ablaze the seething revolt of the countryside, their heart seemed to stop its beating within their 

body; they held their breath, their toil-worn hands went up to their throats as if to repress that awful 

choking sensation which was so like fear.  But Pierre had no such hesitations; if his breath 

seemed to choke him as it reached his throat, if it escaped through his set teeth with a strange 

whistling sound, it was because his excitement was that of a hungry beast who had sighted his 

prey and is ready to spring and devour. His hand did not shake, his step was firm: the gusts of 

wind caught the flame of his torch till the sparks flew in every direction and scorched his hair and 

his hands, and while the others the corners yet.  It will do no harm to try."  Obediently poor Elspie 

tried, but shook her head as she did so.  "There's nothing there, daddy.  I turned it inside out last 

time."  "Wow! but it's ill to bear!" exclaimed old Duncan, with a half-suppressed groan.  Meanwhile 

his daughter put the tin kettle on the fire and prepared their last cup of tea.  When it was ready she 

looked up with a peculiar expression on her face, as she drew something from her pocket.  "Look 

here, daddy," she said, holding up a bit of pemmican about the size of a hen's egg.  The old man 

snatched it from her, and, biting off a piece, began to chew with a sort of wolfish voracity.  "I 

reserved it till now," said the girl, "for I knew that this being the second night, you would find it 

impossible to get to sleep at all without something in you, however small.  If you manage to sleep 

on this and the cup of hot tea, you'll maybe rest well till morning--and then--"  "God forgive me!" 

exclaimed the old man, suddenly pausing, as he was about to thrust the last morsel into his 

mouth; "hunger makes me selfish.  I wass

the straw-rick that was nearest.  For one moment he held the torch aloft. There was triumph now 

in his eyes, in his whole attitude. He looked out into the darkness far away which seemed all the 

more impenetrable beyond the restricted circle of flickering torchlight. It seemed as if he would 

wrest from that inky blackness all the secrets which it hid--all the enthusiasm, the excitement, the 

passions, the hatred which he would have liked to set ablaze as he would the straw-ricks anon. 

"Are you ready, mes amis?" he called.  "Aye! aye!" they replied--not gaily, not lustily, but calmly 

and under their breath.  One touch of the torch and the dry straw began to crackle; a gust of wind 

your mouth."  "No, father, I don't want it.  I really don't feel hungry."  "Elspie, my shild," said old 

Duncan, in a tone of stern remonstrance, "when wass it that you began to tell lies?"  "I'm telling the 

truth, daddy.  I did feel hungry yesterday, but that has passed away, and to-day I feel only a little 

faint."  "Open your mouth, I'm tellin' you," repeated old Duncan in a tone of command which long 

experience had taught Elspie promptly to obey.  She received the morsel, ate it with much relish, 

and wished earnestly for more.  "Now, you'll lie down and go to sleep," she said, after her father 

had washed down the last morsel of food with the last cup of hot tea, "and I'll
