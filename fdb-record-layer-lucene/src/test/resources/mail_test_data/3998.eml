 which she has always been so devout a daughter. Louis carried her off, wil=
ly-nilly, from Antioch, and we hear nothing more but _
whatsoever is without fin or spur; and it is said that he made lawful all, =
and that 'part' is used in the=20

sense of 'the whole:'_) and I have come unto you with a sign from your Lord=
; therefore fear ye=20

God, and obey me _in that which I command you, as to the confession of the =
unity of God and the=20

service of Him_. Verily God is my Lord and your Lord; therefore worship Him=
. This is [the] right=20

way. _But they accused him of falsehood and believed not in him._ And when =
Jesus perceived=20

their unbelief, he said, Who [will be] my helpers for God? The apostles[335=
] answered, We [will be]=20

the helpers of God. We have believed in God; and bear thou witness, _O Jesu=
s_, that we are=20

Muslims [or resigned]. O our Lord, we have believed in that which Thou hast=
 sent down _of the=20

Gospel_, and we have followed the Apostle, _Jesus_; therefore write us down=
 among those who=20

bear witness _of Thy unity and of the truth of Thine apostle_.--And they (_=
that is, the unbelievers=20

among the children of Israel_) devised a stratagem _against Jesus, to slay =
him treacherously_; but=20

God devised a stratagem _against them; for He put the likeness of Jesus upo=
n one who intended=20

his slaughter, and they slew him; and Jesus was taken up_ [into heaven],[33=
6] and God is the best=20

of those who devise stratagems.... _It is related that God sent a cloud to =
Jesus, and it took him up;=20

but his mother clung unto him and wept: whereupon he said unto her, Verily =
the resurrection will=20

unite us.--It is also related that he will descend shortly before the resur=
rection and judge according=20

to the law of this troop was the most notable thing about them. The gay and=
 extravagant queen=20

had devoted much time and thought to the devising of a dress sufficiently s=
howy for herself and=20

her ladies, and, according to the accounts of the chronicler William of Tyr=
e, to whom we are=20

indebted for most of the details of her crusading exploits, Eleanor and her=
 companions presented=20

a gorgeous spectacle. Accompanied by bands of troubadours and musicians, wi=
th much flaunting=20

of gay banners and glittering of spangles, Queen Eleanor, clad man-fashion,=
 in glittering spangle=20

armor, and her ladies rode in the van of the army. Their discarded distaffs=
 these martial ladies sent=20

to recreant knights who had preferred staying at home to crusading.  The sa=
intly Bernard of=20

Clairvaux, the most powerful religious influence of his time, one whose ins=
pired preaching could=20

move vast audiences to a perfect frenzy of religious exaltation, had been i=
nduced, almost=20

compelled, to preach the crusade for that loyal son of the Church, Louis VI=
I. Saint Bernard himself=20

confessed to serious misgivings about the righteousness of this crusade, an=
d would not be a=20

second Peter the Hermit to lead the vast host of the Cross. One can imagine=
 that the doings of=20

Louis's queen must have filled the soul of Saint Bernard with misgivings st=
ill more serious.=20

Eleanor, indeed, was incapable of religious feeling of sufficient depth to =
sympathize with the purer=20

motives of fanaticism that inspired the best of the crusaders. For her it w=
as a pleasure jaunt, a=20

glorious opportunity to enjoy all the pomp and=20


_
[Mohammad], _slay Antichrist and the swine, break the cross, and impose the=
 capitation-tax_ [on=20

unbelievers].--_Also, that he will remain, according to one tradition, seve=
n years; according to=20

another, forty years; and die, and be prayed over: but it is probable that_=
 [by the latter period] _is=20

meant the whole time of his tarrying upon the earth, before the ascension a=
nd after_.     (iii. 43--

47.)   _Remember_ when the apostle said, O Jesus, son of Mary, is thy Louis=
, perhaps, would=20

have been glad to leave his rather too theatrical and frivolous consort beh=
ind, for the crusade was=20

to him a serious business; but it is likely that the large contingent of Ga=
scons and Poitevins,=20

devoted to their troubadour duchess, were hardly so eager about following t=
he King of France.=20

The crusade, whose history we need not dwell upon, was like a triumphal pro=
cession as far as=20

Constantinople. To be sure, there were misery and sickness and=20


_
able to cause a table to descend unto us from heaven?[337] He replied, Fear=
 God, _in demanding=20

signs_, if ye be believers. They said, We desire that we may eat therefrom,=
 and that our hearts=20

may be at ease _in consequence of additional evidence_, and we may know, _w=
ith increased=20

knowledge_, that thou hast spoken truth unto us _in asserting thyself to be=
 a prophet_, and may=20

be witnesses thereof.--Jesus the son of Mary said, O God, our Lord, cause a=
 table to descend=20

unto us from heaven, that it (_namely the day of its descent_) may be unto =
us a festival,[338] unto=20

the first of us and the last of us (_or those who shall come after us_), an=
d a sign from Thee _of=20

Thy power, and of my prophetic office_; and provide us with food _thereby_;=
 for Thou art the best=20

of providers.--God said, _in reply to him_, Verily I will cause it to desce=
nd unto you; but whosoever=20

of you shall disbelieve after _its descent_, I will surely punish him with =
a punishment wherewith I=20

will not punish any [other] of the peoples.--_And the angels descended with=
 it from heaven: upon it=20

were seven cakes of bread and seven fishes; and they ate of them until they=
 were satisfied. And in=20

a tradition related by Ibn-'Abbas it is said that the table brought down fr=
om heaven bread and=20

flesh, and they were commanded not to act who had sought the protection of =
the great army as=20

they journeyed to that Holy Land whose mere sight, they fancied, would be a=
s a balm to their=20

seared consciences; but Queen Eleanor and her princesses experienced nothin=
g but the vain=20

excitement of it all, the wonders of the Greek civilization, the glitter an=
d splendor. Warned by the=20

disastrous experience of the Germans who had preceded him, Louis elected to=
 follow the coast=20

route along the shores of Asia Minor, and he and his army were safely trans=
ported across the=20

straits by the Greeks.  In the march that followed, the vain and headstrong=
 Eleanor more than=20

once jeopardized herself and the whole army. She insisted on leading the va=
n, and her too=20

complaisant husband consented. The result was that Eleanor, with utter disr=
egard of strategy and=20

of ordinary military precautions, conducted her forces as if the expedition=
 were merely a party of=20

pleasure, selected her camps and her route according to the beauty of the l=
andscape, and all the=20

time flirted in the most irresponsible fashion with anyone who attracted he=
r. It was said that she=20

had a most shameful intrigue with a handsome young emir, accepted gifts fro=
m Sultan Noureddin,=20

and spoke of her husband with increasing flippancy, disrespect, contempt. T=
he army was saved in=20

the mountain passes=20


_
but they_ [that is, some of the people] _did so, and were transformed into =
apes and swine_.     (v.=20

112-115.)   Propound unto them, as an example, the inhabitants of the city =
_of Antioch_, when the=20

apostles _of Jesus_ came unto it;[339] when We sent unto them two,[340] and=
 they charged them=20

with falsehood; wherefore We strengthened _them_ with a third;[341] and the=
y said, Verily we are=20

sent unto you. They replied, Ye are not [aught] save men like us, and the C=
ompassionate hath not=20

revealed anything: ye do nothing but lie. They said, Our Lord knoweth that =
we are indeed sent=20

unto you; and naught is imposed on us but the delivering of a plain message=
, _shown to be really=20

nothing is known, but who has been made the central figure in a romance in =
which Eleanor also=20

plays her part.  From Satalia, on the Gulf of Cyprus, the king and Eleanor,=
 with the more well to do=20

among their followers, took ship for Antioch, abandoning the mass of poor f=
ollowers to the mercies=20

of the perfidious Greeks and the fierce Turks. In Antioch, Eleanor was rece=
ived too kindly by her=20

uncle, Raymond, Prince of Antioch, said to have been the handsomest man of =
his time, and as=20

licentious as Eleanor's own grandfather had been. Despite their relationshi=
p, Eleanor's conduct=20

with Raymond made Louis wildly jealous. She was already talking of a separa=
tion from=20
