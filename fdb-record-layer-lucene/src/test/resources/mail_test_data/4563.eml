Was busy with the score;         So it took no great invention           To=

But I cannot stand forever           In the unprotected street.         Is =
there no one to deliver?           I=20

somewhere else for me, I'll just walk backwards into this empty temple and =
turn goddess. [_He=20

makes all sorts of gestures, takes his place, and waits._]  [_Enter Mathura=
 and the gambler._]=20

[30.1. S.  _Mathura._ Oh, sir, a shampooer owes me ten gold-pieces, and he =
got away from us.=20

Hold him, hold him! Stop, stop! I see you from here.  _Gambler._      You m=

take you in;     With Indra, the god, you may stay:     For there's never a=

     Oh, whither flee you, nimble=20

the footprints. Reflectively._] Look! The feet are turned around. And the t=

[_After a moment's thought._] That rogue of a shampooer has gone into the t=
emple with his feet=20

turned around.  _Gambler._ Let's follow him.  _Mathura._ All right. [_They =
enter the temple and=20

take a good look, then make signs to each other._]  _Gambler._ What! a wood=

_Mathura._ Of course not. It's stone. [_He shakes it with all his might, th=
en makes signs._] What=20

do we care? Come, let's have a game. [_He starts to gamble as hard as he ca=

[_Trying with all his might to repress the gambling fever. Aside._] Oh, oh!=
      Oh, the rattle of dice=20

is a charming thing,     When you haven't a copper left;     It works like =
a drum on the heart of a=20

   For highest and most characteristic=20

utterance through one whom Rabelais describes as the "demoniacle" of Geneva=
--JEAN CALVIN=20

(1509-64). The pale face and attenuated figure of the great Reformer, whose=
 life was a long=20

disease, yet whose indomitable will sustained him amid bodily infirmities, =
present a striking=20

contrast to the sanguine health and overflowing animal spirits of the good =
physician who reckoned=20

laughter among the means of grace. Yet Calvin was not merely a Reformer: he=
 was also a=20

humanist, who, in his own way, made a profound study of man, and who applie=
d the learning of a=20

master to the determination of dogma. His education was partly theological,=
 partly legal; and in his=20

body of doctrine appear some of the rigour, the severity, and the formal pr=
ocedures of the law.=20

Indignation against the imprisonment and burning of Protestants, under the =
pretence that they=20

were rebellious anabaptists, drew him from obscurity; silence, he thought, =
was treason. He=20

addressed to the King an eloquent letter, in which he maintained that the R=
eformed faith was=20

neither new nor tending towards schism, and next year (1536) he published h=
is lucid and logical=20

exposition of Protestant doctrine--the _Christianae Religionis Institutio_.=
 It placed him, at the age=20

of twenty-seven, as leader in the forefront of the new religious movement. =
 But the movement was=20

not merely learned, it was popular, and Calvin was resolved to present his =
work to French readers=20

in their own tongue. His translation--the _Institution_--appeared probably =
in 1541. Perhaps no=20

work by an author of seven-and-twenty had ever so great an influence. It co=
nsists of four books--of=20

God, of Jesus as a Mediator, of the effects of His mediatorial work, and of=
 the exterior forms of the=20

Church. The generous illusion of Rabelais, that human nature is essentially=
 good, has no place in=20



Calvin's system. Man is fallen and condemned under the law; all his righteo=
usness is as filthy=20

rags; God, of His mere good pleasure, from all eternity predestinated some =
men to eternal life and=20

others to eternal death; the Son of God came to earth to redeem the elect; =
through the operation=20

of the Holy Spirit in the gift of faith they are united to Christ, are just=
ified through His righteousness=20

imputed to them, and are sanctified in their hearts;=20


_
I know I shall not play.     Yet the rattle of dice is as sweet as the peep=
     Of nightingales in May.=20

6  _Gambler._ My turn, my turn!  P. 56.10]  _Mathura._ Not much! it's my tu=
rn.  _Shampooer._=20

[_Coming up quickly from behind._] Isn't it _my_ turn?  _Gambler._ We've go=
t our man.=20

_Mathura._ [_Seizing him._] You jail-bird, you're caught. Pay me my ten gol=
d-pieces.=20

_Shampooer._ I'll pay you this very day.  _Mathura._ Pay me this very minut=
e!  _Shampooer._ I'll=20

pay you. Only have mercy!  _Mathura._ Come, will you pay me now?  _Shampooe=
r._ My head is=20

getting dizzy. [_He falls to the ground. The others beat him with all their=
 might._]  _Mathura._=20

There [_drawing the gamblers ring_] you're bound by the gamblers' ring.  _S=
hampooer._ [_Rises.=20

Despairingly._] What! bound by the gamblers' ring? Confound it! That is a l=
imit which we gamblers=20

can't pass. Where can I get the money to pay him?  _Mathura._ Well then, yo=
u must give surety.=20

_Shampooer._ I have an idea. [_He nudges the gambler._] I'll give you half,=
 if you'll forgive me the=20

other half.  _Gambler._ All right.  _Shampooer._ [_To Mathura._] I'll give =
you surety for a half. You=20

might forgive me the other half.  _Mathura._ All right. Where's the harm?  =
_Shampooer._=20

[_Aloud._] You of the Church are chosen by the people; the sacraments are t=
wo--baptism and the=20

Lord's Supper. In his spirit of system, his clearness, and the logical ench=
ainment of his ideas,=20

Calvin is eminently French. On the one side he saw the Church of Rome, with=
--as he held--its=20

human tradition, its mass of human superstitions, intervening between the s=
oul and God; on the=20

other side were the scepticism, the worldliness, the religious indifference=
 of the Renaissance.=20

Within the Reforming party there was the conflict of private opinions. Calv=
in desired to establish=20

once for all, on the basis of the Scriptures, a coherent system of dogma wh=
ich should impose itself=20

upon the minds of men as of divine authority, which should be at once a bar=
rier against the=20

dangers of superstition and the dangers of libertine speculation. As the le=
aders of the French=20

Revolution propounded political constitutions founded on the idea of the ri=
ghts of man, so Calvin=20

aimed at setting forth a creed proceeding, if we may so put it, from a conc=
eption of the absolute=20

rights of God. Through the mere good pleasure of our Creator, Ruler, Judge,=
 we are what we are.=20

It is not perhaps too much to say that Calvin is the greatest writer of the=
 sixteenth century. He=20

learned much from the prose of Latin antiquity. Clearness,=20


_
[31.24. S.  _Mathura._ Yes.  _Shampooer._ [_To the gambler._] And you forga=
ve me a half?=20

_Gambler._ Yes.  _Shampooer._ Then I think I'll be going.  _Mathura._ Pay m=
e my ten gold-

pieces! Where are you going?  _Shampooer._ Look at this, gentlemen, look at=
 this! Here I just=20

gave surety to one of them for a half, and the other forgave me a half. And=
 even after that he is=20

dunning me, poor helpless me!  _Mathura._ [_Seizing him._] My name is Mathu=
ra, the clever=20

swindler, and you're not going to swindle me this time. Pay up, jail-bird, =
every bit of my money,=20

and this minute, too.  energy are compensations for his lack of grace, imag=
ination, sensibility, and=20

religious unction. He wrote to convince, to impress his ideas upon other mi=
nds, and his austere=20

purpose was attained. In the days of the pagan Renaissance, it was well for=
 France that there=20

should also be a Renaissance of moral rigour; if freedom was needful, so al=
so was discipline. On=20

the other hand, it may be admitted that Calvin's reason is sometimes the du=
pe of Calvin's=20

reasoning.  His _Life_ was written in French by his fellow-worker in the Re=
formation, Theodore de=20

Beze, who also recorded the history of=20


_
_Mathura._ Sell your father and pay.  _Shampooer._ Where can I get a father=
?  _Mathura._ Sell=20

your mother and pay.  _Shampooer._ Where can I get a mother?  _Mathura._ Se=
ll yourself and=20

pay.  _Shampooer._ Have mercy! Lead me to the king's highway.  _Mathura._ G=
o ahead.=20

Reformed Churches in France (1580). Beze and Viret, together with their lea=
der Calvin, were=20

eminent in pulpit exposition and exhortation, and in Beze the preacher was =
conjoined with a poet.=20

At Calvin's request he undertook his translation of the Psalms, to complete=
 that by=20


_
buy me for ten gold-pieces from this gambling-master? [_He sees a passer-by=
 and calls out._]=20

What is that? You wish to know what I can do? I will be your house-servant.=
 What! he has gone=20

without even answering. Well, here's another. I'll speak to him. [_He repea=
ts his offer._] What! this=20

one too takes no notice of me. He is gone. Confound it! I've had hard luck =
ever since Charudatta=20

lost his fortune.  _Mathura._ Will you pay?  _Shampooer._ How can I pay? [_=
He falls down.=20

Mathura drags him about._] Good gentlemen, save me, save me! [_Enter Dardur=
aka._]  P. 61.5]=20

_Darduraka._ Yes, gambling is a kingdom without a throne.      You do not m=
ind defeat at all;=20

Great are the sums you spend and win;     While kingly revenues roll in,   =
  Rich men, like slaves,=20

 by gambling,     Your friends and=20

wife by gambling,     Your gifts and food by gambling;     Your last cent g=

y health away;     The=20

ace then set me on the street;     The four completed my defeat.           =
                     9  [_He looks=20

before him._] Here comes Mathura, our sometime gambling-master. Well, as I =
can't escape, I think=20

I'll put on my veil. [_He makes any number of gestures with his cloak, then=
 examines it._]      This=20

cloth is sadly indigent in thread;     This lovely cloth lets in a lot of l=

power is nearly fled;     This cloth is pretty when it's rolled up tight.  =
            10  Yet after all, what=20

more could a poor saint do? For you see,      One foot I've planted in the =
sky,     The other on the=20

ground must lie.[41]     The elevation's rather high,     But the sun stand=

to inculcate the duty of entire surrender to the divine will, and written w=

ardour, was presented at the University of Lausanne.     CHAPTER II FROM TH=
E PLEIADE TO=20

MONTAIGNE   The classical Renaissance was not necessarily opposed to high e=
thical ideals; it=20

was not wholly an affair of the sensuous imagination; it brought with it th=
e conception of Roman=20

virtue, and this might well unite itself (as we see afterwards in Corneille=
) with Christian faith.=20

Among the many translators of the sixteenth century was Montaigne's early f=
riend--the friend in=20

memory of all his life--ETIENNE DE LA BOETIE (1530-63). It is not, however,=
 for his fragments of=20

Plutarch or his graceful rendering of Xenophon's Economics (named by him th=
e _Mesnagerie_)=20

that we remember La Boetie; it is rather for his eloquent pleading on behal=
f of freedom in the=20

_Discours de la Servitude Volontaire_ or _Contr'un_, written at sixteen--re=
vised later--in which,=20

with the rhetoric of youth, he utters his invective against tyranny. Before=
 La Boetie's premature=20

death the morals of antiquity as seen in action had been exhibited to Frenc=
h readers in the pages=20

of Amyot's delightful translation of Plutarch's Lives (1559), to be followe=
d, some years later, by his=20

_OEuvres Morales de Plutarque_. JACQUES AMYOT (1513-93), from an ill-fed, r=
agged boy, rose=20

to be the Bishop of Auxerre. His scholarship, seen not only in his Plutarch=
, but in his rendering of=20

the _Daphnis et Chloe_ of Longus, and other works, was exquisite; but still=
 more admirable was=20

his sense of the capacities of French prose. He divined with a rare instinc=
t the genius of the=20

language; he felt the affinities between his Greek original and the idioms =
of his own countrymen;=20

he rather re-created than translated Plutarch. "We dunces," wrote Montaigne=
, "would have been=20

lost, had not this=20


_
_Darduraka._ Well, well, what is this I see? [_He addresses a bystander._] =
What did you say, sir?=20

"This shampooer is being maltreated by the gambling-master, and no one will=
 save him"? I'll save=20

him myself. [_He presses forward._] Stand back, stand back!  [33.25. S. we =
now venture to speak=20

and write; ... it is our breviary." The life and the ideas of the ancient w=
orld became the possession,=20

not of scholars only, but of all French readers. The book was a school of m=
anners and of thought,=20

an inspirer of heroic deeds. "To love=20
