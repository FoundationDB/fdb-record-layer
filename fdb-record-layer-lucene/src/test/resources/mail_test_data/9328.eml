beautiful paper recently put upon the wall, he was not without a feeling of sadness. He conversed 

pleasantly with his neighbors, and twitted their children with invitations to come across the way 

and make a friendly visit. Fifteen minutes before the catastrophe he was engaged in shooting rats, 

and continued the occupation until hearing a loud crash, he ran to the back part of his house, and 

saw that the water had broken down his carriage-house and was driving the carriage into the yard. 

At the same moment he heard cries, the alarm
