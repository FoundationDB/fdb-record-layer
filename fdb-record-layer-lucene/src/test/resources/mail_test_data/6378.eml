Department? American enterprise has surely lagged in this.  Seated in a plu=
sh-covered rocking-

chair that rocked on a track of its own, and thus saved the yellow-and-red =
hotel carpet, the=20

Honourable Dave Beckwith patiently explained the vexatious process demanded=
 by his particular=20

sovereign state before she should consent to cut the Gordian knot of marria=
ge. And his state--the=20

Honourable Dave remarked--was in the very forefront of enlightenment in thi=
s respect: practically=20

all that she demanded was that ladies in Mrs. Spence's predicament should b=
ecome, pro tempore,=20

her citizens. Married misery did not exist in the Honourable Dave's state, =
amongst her own bona=20

fide citizens. And, by a wise provision in the Constitution of our glorious=
 American Union, no one=20

state could tie the nuptial knot so tight that another state could not cut =
it at a blow.  Six months'=20

residence, and a whole year before the divorce could be granted! Honora loo=
ked at the plush=20

rocking-chair, the yellow-and-red carpet, the inevitable ice-water on the m=
arble-topped table, and=20

the picture of a lady the shape of a liqueur bottle playing tennis in the l=
ate eighties, and sighed. For=20

one who is sensitive to surroundings, that room was a torture chamber.  "Bu=
t Mr. Beckwith," she=20

exclaimed, "I never could spend a year here! Isn't there a--house I could g=
et that is a--a little--a=20

little better furnished? And then there is a certain publicity about stayin=
g at a hotel."  The=20

Honourable Dave might have been justly called the friend of ladies in a tem=
porary condition of=20

loneliness. His mission in life was not merely that of a liberator, but his=
 natural goodness led him to=20

perform a hundred acts of kindness to make as comfortable as possible the p=
urgatory of the=20

unfortunates under his charge. He was a man of a remarkable appearance, and=
 not to be lightly=20

forgotten. His hair, above all, fascinated Honora, and she found her eyes c=
ontinually returning to it.=20

So incredibly short it was, and so incredibly stiff, that it reminded her o=
f the needle points on the=20

cylinder of an old-fashioned music-box; and she wondered, if it were proper=
ly inserted, what would=20

be the resultant melody.  The Honourable Dave's head was like a cannon-ball=
 painted white.=20

Across the top of it (a blemish that would undoubtedly have spoiled the tun=
e) was a long scar,--a=20

relic of one of the gentleman's many personal difficulties. He who made the=
 sear, Honora=20

reflected, must have been a strong man. The Honourable Dave, indeed, had fo=
ught his way=20

upward through life to the Congress of the United States; and many were the=
 harrowing tales of=20

frontier life he told Honora in the long winter evenings when the blizzards=
 came down the river=20

valley. They would fill a book; unfortunately, not this book. The growing r=
esponsibilities of taking=20

care of the lonely ladies that came in increasing numbers to Salomon City f=
rom the effeter portions=20

of the continent had at length compelled him to give up his congressional c=
areer. The Honourable=20

Dave was unmarried; and, he told Honora, not likely to become so. He was th=
us at once human=20

and invulnerable, a high priest dedicated to freedom.  It is needless to sa=
y that the plush rocking-

chair and the picture of the liqueur-bottle lady did not jar on his sensibi=
lities. Like an eminent=20

physician who has never himself experienced neurosis, the Honourable Dave f=
irmly believed that=20

he understood the trouble from which his client was suffering. He had seen =
many cases of it in=20

ladies from the Atlantic coast: the first had surprised him, no doubt. Befo=
re seeking her rest,=20

however, she paused outside the door of her master's apartment, and inquire=
d whether she could=20

do anything for him. He called out to her that he did not require anything =
further from her, and that=20

she was to go to bed. She obeyed him, and getting into bed, was soon asleep=
. She describes=20

herself as a sound sleeper, and difficult to awake. It was strange, therefo=
re, that she should awake=20



in the middle of the night, with an impression that some person had entered=
 the house. She looked=20

at her watch; it was twenty minutes past one o'clock. Not being satisfied w=
ith a mere impression,=20

she left her room in her night-dress and went down to the kitchen. There, t=
o her surprise, she saw=20

Miser Farebrother's daughter. The house-keeper does not know how she got in=
to the house, nor=20

for how long a time she had been there. Miss Farebrother asked her angrily =
why she came down=20

without being summoned, and the house-keeper, in explanation, replied that =
she had been=20

awakened by a sound of some person moving in the house, and that she natura=
lly came down to=20

see what it was. Still speaking in anger, Miss Farebrother said that she wa=
s mistress there, and=20

she ordered the house-keeper back to her room. After this order there was n=
o apparent reason=20

why the house-keeper should remain, and she retired from the kitchen and we=
nt to bed again. As=20

she left the kitchen she observed a large knife, with a horn handle, which =
she frequently used for=20

rough work, lying on the table.  "As she lay in bed the house-keeper shortl=
y afterward heard the=20

voices of two persons in altercation in the grounds, and she recognised the=
 voices of her master=20

and his daughter. It seemed to her that they were wrangling violently, but =
this was not an unusual=20

occurrence when Miss Farebrother was at Parksides. Miser Farebrother was, b=
esides, a person of=20

eccentric habits. He was frequently in the habit of wandering through his g=
rounds in the middle of=20

the night. The sounds grew fainter, as though the miser and his daughter we=
re walking away; or,=20

as the house-keeper explains, they may have entered the house and ceased th=
eir dispute.=20

However it was, she fell asleep again, and did not awake till morning. Goin=
g down to her work, she=20

found everything as she had left it on the previous night, with the excepti=
on that the knife with the=20

horn handle was missing.  "Miser Farebrother usually rang for the house-kee=
per at nine o'clock in=20

the morning. On this morning, however, he did not summon her at the accusto=
med time. Neither to=20

this circumstance did she attach any particular importance.  "When ten o'cl=
ock struck, however,=20

the house-keeper felt it strange that she did not hear her master's bell. S=
he waited another half-

hour, and then she went to his room. She knocked, and received no answer. T=
hen she opened the=20

door, and found that the room was empty, and that there was no appearance o=
f the bed having=20

been slept in. Somewhat alarmed, but still not suspecting the dreadful trut=
h, she went to her young=20

mistress's room. That also was empty, and the bed had not been occupied.  "=
Her alarm increased.=20

She searched the grounds for her master and mistress. Her mistress she did =
not find. Her master=20

she did. He was lying upon the ground, at some distance from the house. Ben=
ding over him, she=20

was horrified by the discovery that he was dead--not only that he was dead,=
 but that he had been=20

cruelly, ruthlessly murdered! A dreadful wound was in his breast, and near =
him was the knife with=20

the horn handle, clotted with blood.  "She rushed into the village, and bro=
ught assistance back--a=20

doctor and a policeman, who were followed by two or three=20


_
contained the great Boon, was not esthetic. Being a keen student of human n=
ature, he rightly=20

supposed that she would not care to join the colony, but he thought it his =
duty to mention that=20

there was a colony.  Honora repeated the word.  "Out there," he said, wavin=
g his cigar to the=20

westward, "some of the ladies have ranches." Some of the gentlemen, too, he=
 added, for it=20

appeared that exiles were not confined to one sex. "It's social--a little t=
oo social, I guess," declared=20

Mr. Beckwith, "for you." A delicate compliment of differentiation that Hono=
ra accepted gravely.=20

"They've got a casino, and they burn a good deal of electricity first and l=
ast. They don't bother=20

Salomon City much. Once in a while, in the winter, they come in a bunch to =
the theatre. Soon as I=20

looked at you I knew you wouldn't want to go there."  Her exclamation was s=
ufficiently eloquent.=20

"I've got just the thing for you," he said. "It looks a little as if I was =
reaching out into the sanitarium=20

business. Are you acquainted by any chance with Mrs. Boutwell, who married =
a fellow named=20

Waterford?" he asked, taking momentarily out of his mouth the cigar he was =
smoking by=20

permission.  Honora confessed, with no great enthusiasm, that she knew the =
present Mrs.=20

Waterford. Not the least of her tribulations had been to listen to a partia=
l recapitulation, by the=20

Honourable Dave, of the ladies he had assisted to a transfer of husbands. W=
hat, indeed, had=20

these ladies to do with her? She felt that the very mention of them tended =
to soil the pure=20

garments of her martyrdom.  "What I was going to say was this," the Honoura=
ble Dave continued.=20

"Mrs. Boutwell--that is to say Mrs. Waterford--couldn't stand this hotel an=
y more than you, and she=20

felt like you do about the colony, so she rented a little house up on Wylie=
 Street and furnished it=20

from the East. I took the furniture off her hands: it's still in the house,=
 by the way, which hasn't=20

been rented. For I figured it out that another lady slight examination on t=
he part of the doctor to=20

prove that a frightful murder had been committed.  "Here, for the present, =
the matter rests. The=20

inquest will be held to-morrow.  "Certain discoveries have already been mad=
e which it would be=20

premature here to refer to. The affair is in the hands of the police, who a=
re confident they will=20

succeed in bringing the murderer to justice."  Aunt Leth listened to the ac=
count of the murder with=20

a feeling of unutterable horror. Quiet and observant, Mr. Beeminster carefu=
lly folded the=20

newspaper and put it into his pocket, saying as he did so:  "The 'certain d=
iscoveries' to which the=20

newspaper reporter says it would be premature to refer are Miss Farebrother=
's brooch and veil=20

which were picked up in the grounds."  "Gracious God!" cried Aunt Leth, wit=
h a pallid face and=20

horror-struck eyes. "You do not--you cannot suspect--"  "Best to say as lit=
tle as possible," said Mr.=20

Beeminster, rising.  "You brought a companion in with you," said Aunt Leth.=
 "What was it you=20

whispered to him, and why did he go away?"  Mr. Beeminster was standing nea=
r the window,=20

which faced the street. He looked out, and Aunt Leth's eyes followed the di=
rection of his. The man=20

she referred to was on the opposite side of the road, strolling a few steps=
 leisurely this way and=20

that, but never too far to lose a clear view of the house upon which his ey=
es were fixed.  "Have=20

you placed him there to watch us?" asked Aunt Leth, faintly. "And for what =
reason?"  "A murder=20

has been committed," replied Mr. Beeminster. "Miss Farebrother will most li=
kely be served with a=20

notice to attend the inquest to-morrow."  "It will kill her! it will kill h=
er!" cried Aunt Leth.  Mr.=20

Beeminster, without replying, quietly left the room.     CHAPTER IX.  FRED =
CORNWALL TO THE=20

RESCUE.   So overwhelming was Aunt Leth's despair after Mr. Beeminster's de=
parture that she=20

almost lost her senses. She could not think coherently, but she had a vague=
 consciousness that=20


_
coming along with the same notions. Now you can look at the house any time =
you like."  Although=20

she had to overcome the distaste of its antecedents, the house, or rather t=
he furniture, was too=20

much of a find in Salomon City to be resisted. It had but six rooms, and wa=
s of wood, and painted=20

grey, like its twin beside it. But Mrs. Waterford had removed the stained-g=
lass window-lights in the=20

front door, deftly hidden the highly ornamental steam radiators, and made o=
ther eliminations and=20

improvements, including the white bookshelves that still contained the lady=
's winter reading fifty or=20

more yellow-and-green-backed French novels and plays. Honora's first care, =
after taking=20

possession, was to order her maid to remove these from her sight: but it is=
 to be feared that they=20

found their way, directly, to immediately done, and she put her hands over =
her face and pressed=20

her forehead hard in the endeavour to recall her wandering thoughts. She wa=
s not successful; her=20

mind grew more confused, and she might have remained for a long time in thi=
s most terrible=20

bewilderment had it not been for a loud and rapid knocking at the street do=
or. The interruption had=20

a salutary effect upon her; it caused her to start to her feet, and to beco=
me sensible to what was=20

actually occurring. What did that knocking portend? Some fresh calamity?  "=
Fred! Fred!" she cried.=20

He hastened into the room, and she fell into his arms, and sobbed there hys=
terically.  "Aunt Leth!=20

Aunt Leth!" said Fred, in a soothing tone. "There, there, be calm! You have=
 heard the dreadful=20

news, then?"  "And you," whispered Aunt Leth, amazed that he should=20
