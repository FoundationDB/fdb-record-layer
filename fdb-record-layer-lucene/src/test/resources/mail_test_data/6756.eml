philodendron monstera evening, as all girls who have any idea of what is co=
rrect and proper are of course in by that hour in London. Now, my dears, Co=
nstantia will be a sort of protectress to you three, and I had better write=
 to her at once. My dears, it is a relief to me to know you will be near Co=
nstantia, for London is a ordained?"  "Just so! Just so! I did not mean to =
say I had any. But, as you doubtless remember, my brethren overruled my obj=
ections, and although I greatly regret the theological laxity of our Presby=
tery, I am willing to abide by the decision of the majority. So!"  He dismi=
ssed the two men with a wide philodendron monstera evening, as all girls wh=
o have any idea of what is correct and proper are of course in by that hour=
 in London. Now, my dears, Constantia will be a sort of protectress to you =
three, and I had better write to her at once. My dears, it is a relief to m=
e to know you will be near Constantia, for London is a ordained?"  "Just so=
! Just so! I did not mean to say I had any. But, as you doubtless remember,=
 my brethren overruled my objections, and although I greatly regret the the=
ological laxity of our Presbytery, I am willing to abide by the decision of=
 the majority. So!"  He dismissed the two men with a wide _
and began to counsel her as to the best place to go to.  Mrs. Ellsworthy wa=
s, after all, the first to=20

forgive the girls. She felt very indignant, and stayed away for more than a=
 week; but one evening,=20

when the day's packing was over, and the three, rather tired but quite chee=
rful and full of hope,=20

were sitting down to their tea, her carriage was seen to draw up to the doo=
r, and the little lady,=20

bustling and good-natured as ever, entered the drawing-room.  "My dears," s=
he said, holding out a=20

hand each to Primrose and Daisy, but imprinting a kiss on her favorite Jasm=
ine's brow, "my dears-

-Oh, of course, I am still very angry! I see, too, that you are at that hor=
rid packing; but if you must=20

go, there is a Mrs. Moore--such a good soul, a widow, and quite a lady--ind=
eed, I may say highly=20

connected. She lives in Kensington, and I have written to her. My dears, sh=
e would be charmed to=20

take you all into her family. She would give you comforts--oh! I don't mean=
 luxuries, but the=20

necessary comforts that young girls who are using their brains require. She=
 would feed you well,=20

and chaperone you when you went out, and, in short, see to you all round. I=
 know her house so=20

well. It is very pretty--indeed, charming--and she would take you in for a =
pound a week between=20

you. She would give you board and lodging, and all you require, for a pound=
 a week. I hope, my=20

dear Primrose, you don't consider that too dear. It is, I believe"--here Mr=
s. Ellsworthy coughed=20

slightly--"considered cheap for Kensington."  This torrent of words, poured=
 forth with rapidity and=20

yet with distinctness, rather astonished the girls. They were afraid they h=
ad lost Mrs. Ellsworthy for=20

their friend, and they, every one of them, hailed this overture of kindness=
 with delight. Innocent=20

Primrose never even suspected that a pound a week for the lodging and maint=
enance of three=20

girls was at all unusually cheap. She little guessed that Mrs. Ellsworthy h=
ad written to her special=20

friend, Mrs. Moore, telling her the girls' story, begging of her to give th=
em a home, to provide them=20

with every comfort, and even luxury, and asking her to look to her, Mrs. El=
lsworthy, for the=20

necessary payment.  Jasmine began to dance about, and to say, softly--  "Oh=
! this is too delightful!=20

You darling Mrs. Ellsworthy, you are beginning to approve of our scheme. Oh=
, yes; I know you are,=20

although you were too proud to say so. Now, is it not a little bit wrong of=
 you to be proud after the=20

way you lectured  "By the way, Josiah, have you heard that the day has been=
 all set for the=20

installation service?" asked Mrs. Beaver. "Mr. Fox is arranging it, and it'=
s going to be a great time."=20

"What are they aiming to do?"  "Why, don't you know? An installation servic=
e is a meeting where=20

all the ministers of other towns come in and say nice things about our mini=
ster. Elder Fox says this=20

one will be a special one, because some one has said that Mr. McGowan ain't=
 sound in church=20

doctrine, being as he graduated from what is called a 'New Theology' school=
. Mr. Fox says he's=20

going to prove that ain't so."  "What's all that got to do with him being a=
 man?"  "I guess it ain't got=20

much to do with that. But you know there is a difference between being just=
 a man and being a=20

real minister."  The Captain looked at her oddly. "And they're planning to =
change him from one to=20

the other, is that the idea?"  "No-o, not that exactly. But Mr. Fox thinks =
it would be a good time to=20

show all the people that Mr. McGowan is orthodox. There will be ministers h=
ere from everywhere.=20

The Reverend Mr. Means is coming out from New York."  "If they're all like =
that feller, they'll be a=20

hot lot."  "Josiah Pott! Haven't you any respect for the cloth?"  "Not for =
the kind he wears, I ain't. I'd=20

say his cloth is a sort of sheep's clothing, same as the Bible speaks of." =
 "If you can't talk decent I=20

sha'n't stay," said Mrs. Beaver. She bridled past him, and on into her own =
yard.  What Mrs. Beaver=20

had said concerning plans for the installation service was true. Elder Fox =
was carrying the full=20

responsibility, for he wished to make this meeting one long to be remembere=
d. He selected with=20



great care those who were to sit on the council. The Reverend Mr. Means had=
 been chosen for=20

two reasons, first that he was a personal friend of the Elder, and second b=
ecause his presence=20

would add dignity to the occasion. It was even arranged that the city clerg=
yman should be made=20

moderator.  The eventful day arrived, and with it dignitaries of city and c=
ountryside. It was a=20

fearfully hot humid day in July, one of those days when to move about was t=
orment, and to work=20

was torture. Not a breath of air stirred. The clergymen were plainly enerva=
ted as they descended=20

from the various vehicles which had conveyed them over from Little River. T=
he Reverend Mr.=20

Means mopped his face as the chauffeur assisted him from the Elder's limous=
ine. He greeted=20

every one with deep sonorous tones. His manner was=20


_
we go to Mrs. Moore? I don't know anything about Kensington, but I suppose =
it is as good as any=20

other place. I don't suppose, either, a pound a week is too much for the th=
ree of us. Shall we go to=20

Mrs. Moore, Primrose?"  Daisy also joined her voice in favor of going to Mr=
s. Ellsworthy's friend,=20

and after all, but for that obstinate young person Primrose, the good littl=
e lady might have had her=20

way, but Primrose, although she was quite ignorant of fashionable localitie=
s or of any London=20

expenses, was very firm, very firm indeed, when she made up her mind.  "It =
is most kind of you to=20

call and say all this to us," she answered. "Oh, yes, we would come if we h=
ad not quite decided on=20

an altogether different plan. That being the case we cannot go to Mrs. Moor=
e--thank you so=20

much."  When Jasmine heard her sister speak her face first fell and then br=
ightened up=20

considerably. "How made his way up the steps of the chapel with what was ev=
idently meant for a=20

majestic stride, but his heavy frame turned it into a decided waddle. He sh=
ook hands with a=20

chosen few, all the while looking far above their heads as though his visio=
n were not of this world.=20

The Captain watched the clergyman till he had disappeared behind the vestib=
ule doors, and then=20

remarked to Mrs. Beaver, "Them kind ain't hard to sight. I could sight that=
 feller a mile in the offin',=20

on a dark night, with my eyes shut! If Mack McGowan was that kind, he'd get=
 to stay here about=20

twenty-four hours, and then he'd smell fire and brimstone."  Mrs. Beaver su=
rprised the seaman=20

with a wry smile and vigorous nod.  Mr. McGowan arrived in due season under=
 tow of the Elder.=20

Mr. Fox led him before the clergyman from the city, who was lounging near a=
n open window in the=20

front of the auditorium.  "How do you=20


_
"Oh, yes, we have made a lovely plan, and of course we could not go to anyb=
ody whom anybody=20

knew. Oh, no, of course not. I cannot think how I came to forget."  Again M=
rs. Ellsworthy tried=20

persuasion and even entreaty, but again she had to own herself vanquished b=
y that most=20

obstinate girl Primrose. "I really cannot make out why I care for them all,=
" she said to herself as=20

she drove away. "I do care for them, poor children! I would do anything to =
help them, but I am=20

simply not allowed. Well, Primrose, no doubt you would be a great trial to =
me if you were my=20

daughter; I could never bear obstinate characters, and yet to a certain ext=
ent I admire you."  Miss=20

Martineau also made up her mind to forgive these naughty girls, and to give=
 them the benefit of=20

her most sapient counsel. She too wrote a private letter to a London friend=
, and arrived at=20

Woodbine Cottage primed with what she considered valuable information. "Now=
, my dears, you=20

must go to Shepherd's Bush--that is the place, and the only place where you=
 can live within your=20

means. My friend Constantia Warren has rooms there, and she says--I have wr=
itten to her, my=20

loves--she says if you is this the fortunate young man who has been called =
to this delightful little=20

town?"  "Yes, this is Mr. McGowan. Mr. McGowan, this is the Reverend Mr. Me=
ans from New York=20

City."  The studied dignity of the visiting clergyman seemed to receive a d=
ecided shock as he=20

rolled up out of his chair. He stood before the candidate to whom the Elder=
 had introduced him=20

and forgot to look at the ceiling. He had been caught off his guard, and th=
rough the momentary=20

look of recognition there flitted across his flabby features an expression =
that was far from=20

ecclesiastical. But it was gone as quickly as it had come, and the Reverend=
 Mr. Means was once=20

more his complacent unperturbed self.  "Ho! So this is our candidate? So!" =
he exploded. "I am=20

glad, Mr. McGowan, to shake your hand, and perhaps we'd better do it now, f=
or we might not so=20

desire when the grilling is over. So!" He laughed vociferously at his rude =
joke, and offered his fish-

like palm.  "I'm glad to see you again," lied the candidate, cheerfully.  "=
Again?" echoed the man,=20

his mirth suddenly controlled by well-feigned astonishment. "Again?"  "Have=
 you so soon forgotten=20

how strongly you opposed=20


_
may be able to secure you a clean, respectable bedroom in a fairly good loc=
ality. Constantia is an=20

excellent woman; she is fifty, and plain in her tastes, and has no nonsense=
 about her. She has=20

promised me, for my sake, to accompany you to church in the evenings, and t=
o see that you wear=20

your veils down when you go out, and that you are back in your bedroom--you=
 can't afford a=20

sitting-room, so don't think of was up before the New York Presbytery for o=
rdination?"  "So? Really=20

so? Ah! Yes. I do remember, now that you call it to mind. That probably acc=
ounts for the familiarity=20

of your face. But I did not oppose you for personal reasons, I assure you. =
It was because of your=20

radical theological beliefs. I do not allow personal reasons to enter into =
my religious activities."=20

"But why should you have personal reasons=20
