ancestors!--Quere: What has become of the original intention of these precious documents? of 

which a modern Spanish author has remarked, "Que es el papel mas caro y mas malo que se 

vende." It is the worst and dearest paper that is sold, (Gallardo Dicc. Critico Burlesco). It is, 

however, an indispensable condition to the performance of many of the offices of religion to have 

the last published bull. See Manila Almanack.  [77] In 1810, the total of receipts was 1,466,610 

dollars.  [78] Such assertions demand some evidence in support of them. A very recent case has 

occurred, wherein the colonel of a militia regiment (of Chinese descent), having some dispute with 

a French gentleman, and high words taking place, called up the guard stationed at his door, it is 

supposed to flog him! The French gentleman having procured some weapon, kept the whole 

guard at bay, together with their gallant colonel. Muskets were levelled at him, and he probably 

would have been assassinated, but for the interference of some of the family, and his own 

firmness! Complaint was made of this, but no notice was taken of it, nor was the gallant colonel's 

conduct thought at all incorrect. On the contrary it was very generally applauded!  [79] Large boats 

undecked, pulling from 20 to 30 oars; they carry a four or six pounder and five or six swivels; they 

are fine boats and sail fast. The gun-boats carry a long 24 or 32 pounder, and six or eight swivels; 

and including marines, carry from 80 to 100 men.  [80] For recent information on this subject, see 

chapter on agriculture (revised by Frank Lamson-Scribner, chief of Bureau of Agriculture), in 

Official Handbook of Philippines, pp. 99-126; and Census of Philippines, iv, pp. 11-394, with full 

description of chief products of the islands, methods of cultivation, lists of fruits, vegetables, and 

fiber plants, and detailed statistics of production, lands, etc., as well as of domestic animals of all 

kinds.--Eds.  [81] The fish principally caught is one called Dalag (Blennius?) [81-A] This fish, 

common I believe to many parts of India, presents some phenomena well worth the attention of 

naturalists. In these extensive plains, only a few pools remain in the dry season; and after the 

rains, such multitudes of them are found, that they are caught with baskets only. They weigh from 

one to two pounds, and are from one to two feet in length; they are found in the rice fields, when 

these have been overflowed a few weeks, and strange to relate, in the graves and vaults of 

churches when in damp situations, but with little or no water near them; this fact is related on 

respectable authority. The fish, though not delicate, is good, and forms a valuable article of food 

for the poor.  [81-A] Montero y Vidal mentions this fish (Archipilago filipino, p. 107), as belonging to 

the genus Ophicephalus; it is "abundant in the rivers, lakes, and pools." See also Official 

Handbook of Philippines, pp. 151, 152.--Eds.  [82] They, very unaccountably, neglected any steps 

to procure the martin from Bengal or Cochin China. [82-A] This might, however, have arisen from 

an idea that, as in the Isle of France, the martins might have become as great a nuisance as the 

locusts; but surely the introduction of some species of hawk would have obviated this.  [82-A] 

Montero y Vidal says (Archipilago filipino, p. 113) that the family of Orthoptera, "leaf-eaters in their 

adult stage, are the most fearful scourge for agriculture," perhaps the worst of these plagues being 

the locust (Oedipoda manilensis; Spanish, langosta); "the Indians use great nets to catch them, 

because not only the government pays a bounty for a certain quantity of these destructive insects 

which the natives may present, but they preserve the insects and use them for food." He also 

states (p. 96) that a species of grackle (Gracula) was imported from China (in the Hist. de 

Filipinas, ii, p. 294, he mentions in the same connection martins [pjaros martines]) to exterminate 

this pest; but does not mention the time or the result of this experiment.--Eds.  [83] See VOL. 



XLVIII, p. 96, note 37.--Eds.  [84] This is the Viverra Musanga. [84-A] See Horsfield's Zoology of 

Java.  [84-A] Montero y Vidal states (Archipilago filipino, pp. 86, 87) that two species of carnivores, 

Paradoxurus philippinensis and P. musanga, are dreaded by the coffee-planters; these creatures 

"spend the day in holes dug in the ground, and go out at night to hunt their game." He mentions, 

besides these, two species of civets, both of the genus Viverra. Delgado says (p. 875) that he has 

never seen the mir (Paradoxurus) except in the island of Leyte.--Eds.  [85] Eight rials are a 

Spanish dollar.  [86] The following are the common land measures in use at Manila:  La Brasa de 

tierra is 8 feet 1.6-10 English, (from a new government measure); 10,000 of these, or a square of 

100 each way, is a Quinion.                     10 Balitans is a Quinion                    10 Loanes   is a 

Balitan  Hence the Quinion contains 661511 16-144ths sq. ft. or 73501 2-9ths sq. yds., [86-A] 

which, taking the Bengal bigha at 14400 sq. ft., gives about 46 bigahs, or 15 acres English.  [86-A] 

The quin = 2.79495 hectares = 6.89 acres. (Official Handbook of Philippines, p. 294; Jagor's 

Reisen, p. xv.) Jagor has balstas for balitans, and Mallat has baletas.--Eds.  Their dry measure is 

as follows:  8 Chupas, 1 Ganta.--25 Gantas, 1 Caban.  I could not procure a sight of the standard. 

A mean measurement of several new Gantas and Cabans (for they are all clumsily made, though 

sold at a government office) gave as follows:  The Caban, 4633 cubic inches English.  The Ganta, 

186,878 ditto.  The mean of these two (for the first would give 185.72 to the Ganta) is thus about 

186 cub. inches to a Ganta, and 4650 to the Caban, or 2 bushels and 1-6th Winchester measure. 

[86-A]  [86-A] Since January 1, 1862, the caban of Manila (established January 1, 1860) is 

regarded as the standard measure for all the provinces. It measures exactly 75 liters, or, in cubical 

form, 422 mm., inside measure, or 5,990.96 Spanish cubic inches. (The caban of 1859 contained 

80.00919 liters.) A caban of rice weighs 128 to 137 Spanish pounds = 59 to 63 kilograms." 

(Jagor's Reisen, p. xv.)--Eds.  [87] The table here referred to is as follows:  "Estimate of the cost 

and annual product of one cabalita of land planted with sugar-cane in the province of Pampanga; 

to wit:                                                             p. r. gr.  For plowing the said land 6 times

=========     Net product, equivalent to 90 per cent profit          1  3   2"   Comyn gives similar 

tables for the production of indigo and rice, estimating the net profit thereon at 57 and 60 per cent 

respectively. He adds, on the margin of the sheet: "In favorable years the profit of the grower is 

wont to increase in an extraordinary manner. The 4,000 shoots of sugar-cane, for instance, yield 

him 3 tareas, or 28 loaves of sugar, in place of the 14 loaves which were figured in the 

comparative estimate preceding; the cavan of seed yields 80 and even 100 cavans of rice in the 

hull, in place of the 35 computed; and he obtains a quintal of indigo from 15, or even from 10, 

balsadas, instead of 25 being necessary for furnishing the said product. And if the grower is fairly 

well-to-do, so that he can send his produce to the general market, and sell it to the foreign 



merchants or ship-captains who come for these products, he can obtain incomparably more for 

them than by delivering them upon the ground to the middlemen. At Manila I have seen indigo 

from La Laguna sold at the rate of 130 pesos a quintal for extra fine grade, and at 100 pesos for 

the usual quality; sugar, at 4p. 5r. a loaf; and palay (or rice in the hull) at 3 pesos; but I have 

preferred to limit myself to a low rate in the selling price which I have assigned to the aforesaid 

products in the preceding estimates, in order to demonstrate more thoroughly the advantages 

which agriculture offers in Filipinas, and at the same time to conform to practical experience in the 

formation of estimates of this sort." Cf. similar estimates by Mallat (Philippines, ii, pp. 256-281.--

Eds.  [88] Pilones are large bell-shaped moulds, from 2 to 2 1/2 feet high, and 1 1/2 broad.  [89] 

Some of their voyages are most curious. One or more of the principal men in a village, sometimes 

15 or 20 of them, join to build a small "parao." On this they embark with their harvest in sugar, 

cacao, wax, &c., sell it at Manila, and return to their village; there the accounts are settled, and the 

return cargo distributed; after which a feast is held, and the Santo duly thanked for the good 

markets of this year, and asked for better next. All parties then visit the vessel, which they pull to 

pieces! every man carrying a piece home with him--to take care of till next season, when they are 

all sewed together for another trip.  [90] At the present time there are six varieties of sugar-cane in 

Filipinas; of these, the purple is considered the best, and is more generally cultivated in the 

Visayas; the white and the green are almost exclusively restricted to some provinces of Luzon and 

the rural districts near Manila; the other kinds are cultivated sparingly and in few places. The sugar 

manufactured in the islands is "made in pilones (which includes nearly all from Luzon), and the 

granulated, which is the kind that has been adopted in the Visayan islands and in some Luzon 

plantations." The pilon weighs a quintal; the granulated is put up in sacks (known as bayones, 

containing two and a half arrobas of sugar. (Jos R. de Luzuriaga, in Census of Philippines, iv, pp. 

26, 27).--Eds.  [91] These last, by a royal Cedula (ordonnance), are only admitted into the island 

as cultivators. This, like almost every ordonnance of His Catholic Majesty, relative to this country, 

is disregarded; and the Chinese are almost all shopkeepers, or petty merchants. Were an impartial 

account of the administration of these islands to be presented to the king of Spain, it might begin 

thus: "Sire,--Not one of your Majesty's orders are executed in your kingdom of the Philippines." 

[91-A]  [91-A] Cf. similar statements by Viana (letter to Carlos III) and Anda (Memorial), in VOL. L.-

-Eds.  [92] This case actually occurred to one of the most respectable military officers in the 

Spanish service, now a captain in the inflict with his sharp hind claw when brought to bay.  From 

ten to twelve miles is by no means an unusual run, and when thoroughly exhausted he makes a 

stand, either with his back against a tree, or in the water.  In both of these positions he is no 

despicable adversary, and will do much damage to a pack of hounds, by grasping them in his 

short fore arms and ripping them open, if on land; or by seizing and holding them under, if in the 

water.  Instances are on record of a despairing kangaroo dashing through the dogs on the 

approach of a dismounted hunter, and severely wounding him.  The common practice when the 

animal is brought to bay is to ride up and pistol him.  But, however he may be killed, his useful 

qualities have by no means departed with his breath.  His skin, properly cured, will make good 

door-mats, boots, saddle-cloths, stock-whips, gaiters, and numberless other useful articles. His 

long and heavy tail is much valued for the soup it yields; and the hams can be cured, and, thus 

preserved, find many admirers.  The hind-quarters of a large "boomer" will run little short of 



seventy pounds; and, with the tail, form the only parts commonly eaten by Europeans.  The birds 

that we encountered were of every form and size; pigeons, some coloured like parrots, others 

diminutive as sparrows, and of the same sombre hue:  pheasants, quail, every kind of feathered 

fowl that could gladden the heart of the sportsman, were found in abundance, and amongst these 

the scrub turkey and its nest.  This latter bird is so little known, that I am tempted to give a short 

account of it.  The Australian scrub turkey ('Tallegalla Lathami') is common in all the thick jungles 

in the north of Queensland, and, though smaller than the domestic bird, is sufficiently like it to be 

easily recognised, having the same wattle, and neck denuded of feathers.  The most remarkable 

feature about this turkey is its nest, which is composed of sand, leaves, and sticks, piled up into a 

great mound three feet or so in height, and ten or more in diameter.  This enormous mass is not 

the unaided work of one pair, but of a whole colony, and the material is got together by the bird 

grasping a quantity in its foot, and throwing it behind him; the ground in the immediate vicinity of 

the mound is thus entirely stripped of every blade of grass, or fallen leaf.  In process of time, the 

heap partially decomposes, and when the female judges that enough heat has been engendered 

to serve her purpose, she proceeds to lay her eggs.  These are enormous when compared with 

the size of the bird, and are not simply deposited and covered over, but buried at a depth of 

eighteen or twenty inches, each egg nearly a foot from its neighbour, and standing on end, with 

the larger half uppermost.  Thus they remain until hatched, though how the bird manages to plant 

them with such dexterity has, I believe, never been ascertained; no one yet having been 

sufficiently lucky to witness the proceeding.  Directly the little birds chip the shell, they run about 

with the greatest agility, and their capture is exceedingly difficult. A nest with freshly-laid eggs is a 

glorious find, for several dozen are frequently extracted, and are most delicious eating.  The 

evening was fast approaching, when we camped for the night by the side of a nice clear water-

hole in a sequestered valley, and, after bathing and having tea, we tried our luck at fishing, for 

these holes are sometimes full of eels.  We prospered, and soon had several fine fellows on the 

bank, from whence they were speedily transferred to the hot ashes, and roasted in their integrity; 

they were thus spared the skinning, to which, it is averred, custom has habituated them. Ferdinand 

and Cato were collecting firewood for the night, for, in the position we had selected, we were not 

afraid of making a good blaze, and we were sitting and lounging round the fire, conjecturing what 

had become of all the blacks, and how soon we should fall in with the other party, when Lizzie--

who had accompanied the troopers--came rushing back, and said:--  "One fellow snake been bit 

'em Cato; plenty that fellow go bong (dead) by-and-by, mine believe."  We all jumped up, and sure 

enough, poor Cato came slowly towards us, looking the ashy-grey colour to which fear turns the 

black, and followed by Ferdinand, who dragged after him a large black snake, the author of the 

mischief.  If Australia is exempt from wild beasts, the number of venomous reptiles with which it is 

cursed make it as dangerous to the traveller as other tropical countries in which ferocious animals 

abound.  Hardly a tree or a shrub can be found that does not contain or conceal some stinging 

abomination.  The whole of these are not, of course, deadly, but a tarantula bite, or a centipede 

sting, will cripple a strong man for weeks, while a feeble constitution stands a fair chance of 

succumbing.  But of all these pests, none can equal the snakes, which not only swarm, but seem 

to have no fear of man, selecting dwellings by choice for an abode.  These horrible reptiles are of 

all sizes, from the large carpet snake of twenty feet, to the little rock viper of scarcely half a dozen 



inches.  The great majority of these are venomous, and are of too many different kinds for me to 

attempt their enumeration here.  The most common with us were the brown, black, and whip 

snakes, and the death-adder, all poisonous; and the carpet-snake, harmless.  The brown and 

black snakes run from two to eight feet in length, frequent the long grass, chiefly in the 

neighbourhood of swamps, and from the snug way in which they coil up, and their disinclination to 

move, are highly dangerous.  The latter is very handsome, the back of a brilliant black, and the 

under portion of a sea-shell pink. Their skin is sometimes used by bushmen as a cover to their 

waistbelts, which are much beautified thereby.  The whip-snakes are of all sizes and of all colours; 

in fact, under this name the colonists include all the slender climbing snakes, so many of which 

inhabit Australia.  In my opinion, these are the worst; for they come boldly into your room in search 

of warmth, and may be found stowed away in a boot, or under the pillow, or in any place where 

they are least expected.  Last and worst of our venomous snakes comes the death, or deaf, adder, 

for it is called indiscriminately by both names, and amply justifies either prefix.  The hideous reptile 

is very thick and stumpy in proportion to its length, which rarely exceeds two feet, whilst its 

circumference may be put down at one-fifth of its total measurement. The tail is terminated by a 

small curved spike, which is commonly regarded as the sting; but though when touched it doubles 

up, and strikes with this horn, as well as bites, I do not think the tail does any material damage, but 

this opinion one would find it difficult to make a bushman credit.  I once saw a man take a death-

adder up--quite unintentionally, you may be sure--between two shingles, and it immediately struck 

backwards with both head and tail, the two extremities luckily meeting above his hand.  From the 

sluggish habits of this reptile, it is popularly accounted deaf, and it seems quite unalarmed even by 

the report of a gun.  You may walk over it a dozen times, as it lies basking in the sun, usually in 

the most frequented part of the road, and it will take not the slightest notice, but if touched, 

however gently, it bites at once.  When I first went to Cardwell, I was talking about death-adders, 

and the naive remark made by one of the inhabitants amused and at the same time rather terrified 

me, for the perfect knowledge he exhibited of the reptiles showed plainly how common they were 

there.  "Nasty things," he said, "but Lord, they won't hurt you.  Best not try to get one alive into a 

bottle, though.  I tried that little game on, with a pickle-jar and a stick, but I couldn't get him in, and 

he doubled up and very nearly bit me; his tail just grazed my hand as it was."  I thanked my 

informant, and assured him from the bottom of my heart, that whenever I 'did' try to coax a death-

adder into a bottle, I would benefit by his experience and use the greatest caution.  The eye of this 

snake is remarkable for its vivid yellow, crossed by a black longitudinal pupil.  The colour of the 

body is a mixture of dull hues, and the abdomen pinkish; the head broad, thick, flattened, and its 

'tout ensemble' hideously repulsive.  But I am digressing, and leaving poor Cato still uncared for. 

The snake, which was a very large one, had been laid hold of by the boy in the imperfect light, and 

had instantly bitten him in the wrist, on which the punctures of the fangs were plainly visible.  A 

handkerchief was at once tied round the wounded limb, with a small pebble so placed as to 

compress the brachial artery inside the forearm, and with the iron ramrod from a carbine as a 

lever, we screwed this rough tourniquet up until the circulation was in great measure cut off. 

Luckily Dunmore had a pocket-knife with him, for the sheath-knives we carried were but rude 

instruments for surgery, and with the small blade he slashed the bitten part freely, while Lizzie, 

applying her lips to the wound, did her best to draw out the subtle venom.  Some of us carried 



flasks, containing various spirits, and the contents of these were at once mixed--brandy, rum, 

hollands, all indiscriminately--in a quart pot, and tossed off by the sufferer, without the slightest 

visible effect.  Had the spirit taken the smallest hold upon him, we should have felt hope, for if a 

man suffering from snake-bite can be made intoxicated, he is safe.  But the poison neutralised the 

potent draught, and poor Cato showed no indication of having swallowed anything stronger than 

water. With the superstition inherent in the blacks, he had made up his mind to die, and his broken 

English, as he moaned out, "Plenty soon this fellow go bong," was painful in the extreme.  "It's no 

use," said Dunmore.  "I know these fellows better than any of you, and Cato will never recover.  I 

had a boy down on the Mary River, who was knocked down with low fever.  Half a pennyweight of 

quinine would have put him to rights, but he had made up his mind to die, and when once they 

have done that, all the drugs in a doctor's shop won't do them any good."  Everything we could 

think of was proposed, but speedily rejected as useless.  "Pour a charge of powder on the wound," 

said Jack Clarke, "and then fire it, that will take the part out clean enough;" but we agreed that it 

would be putting the boy to unnecessary pain, for the poison must be already in the system and 

beyond the reach of local remedy; and the patient had become drowsy, and repeatedly begged to 

be left alone and allowed to go to sleep.  "We must walk him about," said Dunmore, "it is the only 

chance, and painful as it is, I must have it done.  Remember, I'm responsible for the boy, and no 

means must be left untried."  I had withdrawn a little from the group, and as I stood some distance 

off, outside the circle of light thrown by the fire, I could not help thinking what a scene for the 

painter's brush was here presented.  The dark outline of the lofty gums looked black and 

forbidding as funeral plumes, against the leaden sky.  The rugged range starting up in the rear, 

cast a threatening gloom over the little valley in which we were encamped, and the distant thunder 


_
Regiment, whose name is Don M---- de O----. This gentleman, a man of high spirit, and one of the 

few Spaniards in Manila who are an ornament to their profession, bearing the king's commission, 

and in pursuit of the robbers, suddenly fell in with a noted chief of them, when accompanied only 

by a piquet of infantry. The robber knew him, and with a gallantry worthy of a better cause, defied 

him to single combat! With true chivalric spirit, the challenge was instantly accepted; and orders 

given to the piquet not to interfere on pain of their lives. A desperate conflict ensued, in which the 

gallant Spaniard was at length victorious, and the robber's head was sent through the country in 

triumph. Shall the sequel be told? When he returned to Manila, with the blessing of every honest 

native for having cleared that part of the country of robbers, a subject of prosecution was found in 

this service by those numerous enemies which every honest man has in a country like this, and on 

some frivolous pretext of having (unavoidably) fired into a cottage, and killed or wounded some 

innocent persons. He could not stoop to flatter or bribe; and it was with the utmost difficulty, and 

rather by the exertions of his friends than by his own, that after suffering a long series of vexations, 

he was saved from ruin!  [93] Manufactured, I think, from the Urtica nevea of Linn. [93-A]  [93-A]

saponaria? [94-A]  [94-A] This plant (variously known to the natives as gogong, gogo, bayogo, and 

balogo) is a leguminous climbing plant, Entada scandens (Official Handbook of Philippines, pp. 

367, 384). Blanco (Flora, pp. 247, 248) praises its detergent qualities, especially for bathing 

purposes, as even superior to the soap of Europe; and says that it is also used medicinally for 

asthma, and as a purgative, and that the Indians place little effort, be interpreted as a dull voice of 

warning from the mountain.  The fitful glare of the fire, now sinking, now rising as a fresh brand 

was added, threw a ruddy glare over the actors in this strange scene; showing the hopeless face 

of the poor patient, the undemonstrative countenances of his sable companions, and the anxious 

air apparent in the white men, more particularly in Dunmore, as he knelt over his follower, and 

tried to inspirit a little hope by dwelling on the chances of recovery.  The fantastic dresses, and the 

wildness of the spot, all combined to add a weird aspect to the group; and recalled forcibly to the 

mind those scenes of Pyrenean robber-life, so faithfully portrayed by the magic pencil of Salvator 

Rosa.  But drowsiness was fast closing the eyes of poor Cato, and, as the last chance, we 

compelled him to walk about, despite his piteous prayers for repose.  It soon became evident that 

our labour was thrown away, for he dropped heavily down from between the two men who were 

supporting him, and no power could induce him to rise.  A heavy stertorous sleep overwhelmed 

him, his breath came gradually slower and slower, and about two hours from the time of the 

accident, poor Cato passed away, peacefully and without pain.  Can no antidote be discovered for 

this virulent poison?  Empirics are common who profess to cure snake-bites, but I doubt if they 

ever really succeed.  It is beyond all question that in the early days of Australia, and whilst this 

beautiful continent was held by Great Britain as nothing more than a useful place for the safe 

custody of her criminal classes, a convict named Underwood discovered a remedy for snake-bite, 

and in many cases treated it successfully.  The story has by no means died out in the colonies, of 

the good old laws of brutal terrorism, under which, when a bitten man was brought to Underwood, 

the latter proceeded to apply his remedy, stimulated by the pleasing threat of a severe flogging, 

should his treatment be of no avail.  He
