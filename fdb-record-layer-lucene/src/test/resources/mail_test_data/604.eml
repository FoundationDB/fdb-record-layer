"That girl knows how to _dress_, all right!"  But it was n't Honey's dress that stirred Mrs. Jackson's 

soul to the depths.  These Skinners were hand in glove with the inaccessible Wilkinsons, and--the 

devil take it--Jackson was no longer a customer of McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc.  Skinner read the 

evening paper with great satisfaction.  The inky seed disseminated through the press was, he felt, 

bound to take strong root in the fertile consciousness of Mrs. Curmudgeon W. Jackson, and 

therefrom was sure to react effectively upon the decidedly active consciousness of Jackson 

himself.  With this end in view, as per plan of campaign for the reclamation of Willard Jackson, 

Skinner had had himself interviewed on a subject dear and flattering to the Middle West, especially 

flattering to St. Paul. He had written his "first impressions of St. Paul" on the way out from New 

York, and had permitted the same to be extracted by the reporters--with great cunning--from his 

modest and reluctant self. Honey was present--designedly present--while the young newspaper 

men were quizzing Skinner, dressed in her very latest, which was carefully noted and described in 

the interview, for decorative purposes.  "We just looked in _en passant_," Skinner observed to the 

reporters, using his French to the limit.  "It's a kind of belated honeymoon. We've seen Mr. Hill's 

residence and we veri_ which took all the value from the statement. Sir James went away fully 

determined to repeat the story in the most favourable way--to give the best representation of it 

possible; but he was not satisfied. It was with a most serious face that he mounted his horse and 

rode away, shaking his head from time to time. "No, no," he said to himself, "that will never hold 

water--that will never hold water!" When this interview was over, John went back to his library and 

sat down in his usual chair with a sense of exhaustion and hopelessness which it would be difficult 

to describe. He had told his story as best he could, searching his memory for every detail; but he 

had not been believed. He had gone on, growing impassioned in his self-defence--growing 

indignant, feeling himself powerless in face of that blank wall of incredulity, that steady incapacity 

to believe. "Why should I tell you a lie?" he cried, at last. "Do not you see? Have you not said that 

it was for my interest to tell you the truth?" "I am not saying you have told a lie," Sir James said, 

always shaking his head. "No, no--no lie. You will never be accused of that." When he went away, 

he had laid his heavy old hand on John's shoulder. "My poor lad, if you had only had the courage 

to open your heart all the way!" he said. John felt like a victim in the hands of the Inquisition. What 

did they

wonderful flour mills in Minneapolis, your neighbor"--  He paused.  A frozen atmosphere seemed 

suddenly to enshroud the reporters.  Their pencils ceased to record.  "Oh, yes, let's get back to St. 

Paul."  Instantly the temperature rose about a hundred degrees, and the reporters' pencils began 

to move again.  When the newspaper men were gone, Skinner jotted down:--                     _Dress-

Suit Account_             _Debit_              as if a little more pressure, a few more twists of the screw, 

would make him accuse himself of anything, and confess all that they might require.  He did not 

know how long he sat there, silent, doing nothing, not even thinking anything, alone with himself 

and the cloud that hung over his life, with a consciousness that all his movements were watched, 

that even this would be something against him, a proof of that remorse which belongs to

Useful hint!  When you're                                     in St. Paul, talk about                                     _St. 

Paul_!   And when he read his interview in the evening paper, Skinner made this entry:-- 

_Dress-Suit Account_             _Debit_                         _Credit_                                      A certain 

remarkable                            other, more full of oppression, rolled over him. Beaufort had 

disappeared, and did not return till late in the afternoon, when the twilight was falling. A few words 

only passed between them, and these related solely to Beaufort's thoughts, not to Erskine's.  "It is 

_her_ husband who has been killed," Beaufort said; "you never told me."  "I could not tell you. It 

was too extraordinary; it was an impiety," John said.  But neither

matters which I never thought                                     I possessed.  In fact, which I 

never did possess until I got                                     the dress suit.   The Skinners devoted the days 

between Wednesday and Saturday to loafing or sight-seeing, principally the former.  They drove 

over to Minneapolis again and took in the wonderful flour mills, for anything that They said nothing 

more to each other, except such civilities as are indispensable when men eat together,--for they 

dined all the same, notwithstanding the circumstances. In every crisis men must still dine; it is the 

only thing that is inevitable, in trouble or in joy.  And then the night followed. Night is horrible, yet it 

is consolatory to those who are in suspense. John could not suppose that his trials were over, that 

nothing was to follow; but by ten o'clock

the Lake and had a trout dinner and all the rest of it.  But after a time, this unaccountably useless 

routine got on Honey's nerves.  "Dearie," she protested, "this is our honeymoon, to be sure, but 

don't you think you ought to get after business?"  "Don't worry.  Business will get after _us_ pretty 

soon."  "But time is flying."  "Time is doing just what I want it to do.  It takes time for plans to 

develop.  It takes time for seed to grow.  I started business getting after us Sunday morning at the 

First Presbyterian Church in himself, with relief, that nothing could happen to-night. Rolls, too, had 

evidently arrived at the same conclusion. He was heard to close and bolt the door ostentatiously 

while it was still early, and there was something in the very noise he made which proclaimed the 

satisfaction with which he did it. But after this there was a long black evening still, and hours of 

darkness, to follow, which John did not know how to get through. Almost he had made up his mind 

to step out of the window at midnight, as Rolls had suggested, and
