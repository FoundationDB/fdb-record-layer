which the robbery had been effected was very simple. The prisoner had won o=

a servant in Lord H----'s household, and used the information he thus obtai=
ned to effect, with her=20

connivance, if not her assistance, the crime for which he afterwards stood =

Bailey. This, however, was not his first appearance in that court. He had b=

 incredible until one=20

has seen it. This river, however, did that in 1882, when the great general =
overflow occurred.=20

Unnumbered lives were lost that year, and the damage to property was never =

The sister, through=20

whose instrumentality he now escaped, became acquainted with his last crime=
 and peril by a=20

newspaper, which, in noticing the cases laid before the grand jury, mention=
ed, as a fact=20

discovered by the prosecution, the real name of the accused, and one or two=
 instances of his early=20

career, sufficient to prove his identity with her lost brother.  From the m=
oment when Clara made=20

this discovery, it had become impossible for her to get access to his lords=
hip. Her first thought was=20

to throw herself at his feet, and ask, as the only disinterested favour she=
 had sought at his hands,=20

and as the highest reward for her dishonour--a brother's liberty. Foiled in=
 this, her woman's wit=20

suggested a communication with the attorney for the defence. She had no dif=
ficulty in ascertaining=20

who had that task allotted to him, and she met Mr. Wheedle, who arranged wi=
th her the stratagem=20

which proved so successful.         *       *       *       *       *  This=
 little episode was followed by one or=20

two circumstances that the reader may be put in possession of. Lord H----, =
who was by no means=20

a strong-minded man, accepted the incident as a warning of Providence. He w=
ould not for  Since=20

that spring the reports have not indicated any flood equal to the present o=
ne; and the only reason=20

why this year has not proved as disastrous as 1882, is that the levees have=
 been strengthened=20

since then. The fact, however, that the levee system has, as a whole, succe=
ssfully withstood the=20

pressure of the highest water known for many years, is by no means as reass=
uring as it seems on=20

first consideration; for there is grave reason to believe that the levees t=
hemselves serve to=20

increase the very danger against which they are a guard.  The planters of t=
he earlier days made=20

efforts to protect themselves by means of =E2=80=9Clevees:=E2=80=9D a name =
given by the  [Illustration: TROPICAL=20

raised places.=E2=80=9D But of later=20

years, both state and national resources have been spent freely in endeavor=
ing to curb the=20

restless giant. More than $25,000,000 has been spent in this way since the =
war. The Mississippi=20

River Commission, organized in 1879, under the supervision of the War Depar=
tment, as the Signal=20

Service has been, had nominally in view the increasing of facilities for na=
vigation; but as the=20

methods employed for the two objects have necessarily been much the same, n=

somewhat attached, and he dreaded the notoriety of his own criminal associa=
tion with the=20

prisoner's sister. He resolved to be virtuous, and carried out that resolut=
ion by a financial=20

arrangement with his mistress, through the family lawyer. She, who had not =
been further tainted by=20

sin than in her illicit connexion with the prosecutor, used the means now p=
laced at her disposal in=20

a way that enabled her to gain an honest and creditable livelihood hencefor=
th. Her brother tried to=20

do the same; but that wish was broken down by the constant interference wit=
h his good resolutions=20

from  The character of the lower Mississippi and its valley gravely increas=
e the difficulties of the=20

case. Its bed has been worn for ages through a somewhat elevated region, an=
d at present the=20

resultant valley has a width varying from twenty to one hundred and fifty m=
iles. The result has=20

been that the channel of the river shifts continually, and is extremely cro=
oked, literally turning time=20

and again to every conceivable point of the compass. These curves present t=
he most vexatious=20

features the levee system must contend with; for it is easily perceived tha=
t the levee on the convex=20


_
modes, like his sister, for obtaining an honest livelihood; but the impossi=
bility of maintaining an=20

incognito rendered this impracticable. Ever and anon he encountered former =
"friends," who reviled=20

his intentions, and frustrated them. It was a good joke, they told him, tha=
t against it, adding the=20

great eroding power of the water to the weight it must sustain.  =E2=80=9CT=
he levees are relied on as the=20

chief aid to the work of the commission, but the commission does not constr=
uct them, or even=20

work directly to strengthen them. These levees are nothing more=20
