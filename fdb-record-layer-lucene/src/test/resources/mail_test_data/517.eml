he was so proud.  "I've sent for the prairie-schooner," I told him.  His fl=
ush of anger rather startled=20

me.  "Doesn't that impress you as rather cheaply theatrical?" he demanded. =
 "I fancy it will be very=20

comfortable," I told him, without looking up. I'd apparently been attributi=
ng to him feelings which,=20

after all, were not so desolating as I might have wished.  "Every one to hi=
s own taste," he=20

observed as he called rather sharply to Tokudo to bring him his humidor. Th=
en he took out a cigar=20

and lighted it and ordered the car. And that was the lee and the long of it=
. That was the way we=20

faced our Great Divide, our forked trail that veered off East and West into=
 infinity!     _Thursday the=20

Eleventh_   The trek is over. And it was not one of triumph. For we find ou=
rselves, sometimes, in=20

deeper water than we imagine. Then we have to choke and gasp for a while be=
fore we can get our=20

breath back.  Peter, in the first place, didn't appear with the prairie-sch=
ooner. He left that to come=20

later in the day, with Whinnie and Struthers. He appeared quite early Monda=
y morning, with fire in=20

his eye, and with a demand to see the master of the house. Heaven knows wha=
t he had heard, or=20

how he had heard it. But the two men were having it hot and heavy when I fe=
lt it was about time=20

for me to step into the room. To be quite frank, I had not expected any suc=
h outburst from Duncan.=20

I knew his feelings were not involved, and where you have a vacuum it is im=
possible, of course, to=20

have an explosion. I interpreted his resentment as a show of opposition to =
save his face. But I was=20

wrong. And I was wrong about Peter. That mild-eyed man is no plaster saint.=
 He can fight, if he's=20

goaded into it, and fight like a bulldog. He was saying a few plain truths =
to Duncan, when I stepped=20

into the room, a few plain truths which took the color out of the Dour Man'=
s face and made him=20

shake with anger.  "For two cents," Duncan was rather childishly shouting a=
t him, "I'd fill you full of=20

lead!"  "Try it!" said Peter, who wasn't any too steady himself. "Try it, a=
nd you'd at least end up=20

with doing something in the open!"  Duncan studied him, like a prize-fighte=
r studying his waiting=20

opponent.  "You're a cheap actor," he finally announced. "This sort of thin=
g isn't settled that way,=20

and you know it."  "And it's not going to be settled the way you intended,"=
 announced Peter Ketley.=20

"What do you know about my intentions?" demanded Duncan.  "Much more than y=
ou imagine,"=20

retorted Peter. "I've got your record, McKail, and I've had it for three ye=
ars. I've stood by, until now;=20

but the time has come when I'm going to have a hand in this thing. And you'=
re not going to get=20

your freedom by dragging this woman's name through a divorce-court. If ther=
e's any dragging to=20

be done, it's your carcass that's going to be tied to the tail-board!"  Dun=
can stood studying him=20

with a face cheese-colored with hate.  "Aren't you rather double-crossing y=
ourself?" he mocked.=20

"I'm not thinking about myself," said Peter.  "Then what's prompting all th=
e heroics?" demanded=20

Duncan.  "For two years and more, McKail," Peter cried out as he stepped cl=
oser to the other man,=20

"you've given this woman a pretty good working idea of hell. And I've seen =
enough of it. It's going=20

to end. you the whole of my shameful history, you would join with all your =
heart in this prayer."=20

The biographer, while he proves his integrity by giving us the letter, of c=
ourse protests against our=20

taking seriously the self accusations of a saint. We certainly shall not ta=
ke seriously any charge of=20

deceitfulness against Keble, whether made by himself or by any other human =
being, but he was=20

liable, to a certain extent, like all other human beings, to self-deception=
. His opinions, like those of=20

his associates, on theological questions in general and on the question of =
the Eucharist in=20

particular, had been moving rapidly in a Romanizing direction during the in=
terval between the=20

publication of "The Christian Year" and that of the "Lyra Innocentium." In =
the passage just quoted,=20

we see that he was conscious of this, but it was not unnatural that he shou=
ld sometimes forget it,=20



and that he should then put upon the words in "The Christian Year" a constr=
uction in conformity=20

with his opinions as they were in their most advanced stage. It is strange,=
 however, that he and=20

the rest of his party, if they were even dimly and at intervals conscious o=
f the fact that their own=20

creed had undergone so much change, should still have been able to take the=
 ground of=20

immutability and infallibility in their controversies with other parties an=
d churches.  It has been=20

almost forgotten that Keble held for ten years a (non- resident) Professors=
hip of Poetry at Oxford.=20

His lectures were unfortunately written, as the rule of the Chair then was,=
 in Latin. He thought of=20

translating them, and Sir John Coleridge seems still to hold that the task =
would be worth=20

undertaking. For the examples, which are taken from the Greek and Latin poe=
ts, it would be=20

necessary to substitute translations or examples taken from the modern poet=
s. Mr. Gladstone=20

chooses, the apt epithet when he calls the lectures "refined." Refinement r=
ather than vigour or=20

depth was always the attribute of Keble's productions. His view of poetry, =
however, as the vent for=20

overcharged feelings or an imagination oppressed by its own fulness--as a _=
vis medica_, to use=20

his own expression--if it does not cover the whole ground, well deserves at=
tention among other=20

theories.  To the discredit, perhaps, rather of the dogmatic spirit than of=
 either of the persons=20

concerned, religious differences were allowed to interfere with he personal=
 friendship formed in=20

youth between Keble and Arnold. With this single and slight exception, Kebl=
e's character in every=20

relation--as friend, son, husband, tutor, pastor--seems to have been all th=
at the admirers of "The=20

Christian Year" can expect or desire. The current of his life, but for the =
element of theological=20

controversy and perplexity which slightly disturbed his later days, would h=
ave been limpid and=20

tranquil as that of any rivulet in the quiet scene where the years of his C=
hristian ministry were=20

passed. He and his wife, the partner of all his thoughts and labours, and t=
he mirror and partaker of=20

the beauty of his character, died almost on the same day; she dying last, a=
nd rejoicing that her=20

husband was spared the pain of being the survivor.    "Within these walls [=
of the Church] each=20

fluttering guest   Is gently lured to one safe nest--   Without=20


_
end. But it's not going to end the way you've so neatly figured out!"  "The=
n how do you propose to=20

end it?" Duncan demanded, with a sort of second-wind of composure. But his =
face was still=20

colorless.  "You'll see when the time comes," retorted Peter.  "You may hav=
e rather a long wait,"=20

taunted Duncan.  "I have waited a number of years," answered the other man,=
 with a dignity which=20

sent a small thrill up and down my spine. "And I can wait a number of years=
 more if I have to."=20

"We all knew, of course, that you were waiting," sneered my husband.  Peter=
 turned to fling back=20

an answer to that, but I stepped between them. I was tired of being haggled=
 over, like marked-

down goods on a bargain-counter. I was tired of being a passive agent befor=
e forces that seemed=20

stripping me of my last shred of dignity. I was tired of the shoddiness of =
the entire shoddy=20

situation.  And I told them so. I told them I'd no  The writer of those lin=
es perfectly as well as=20
