cover, or at the lick, this=20

is his opportunity.  In the Adirondack country and in Northern Maine, it is=
 a common sight to see a=20

young bear about a farmhouse, where he is as much at home as the farm-dog. =
 Many of the=20

summer hotels, in this region, keep a tame bear to amuse the visitors.  The=
se bears are obtained=20

as cubs from any one who is fortunate enough to discover a bear's den and w=
ho has the good luck=20

to find the old bear away from home and the cubs at his mercy.  A likely cu=
b can usually be=20

obtained in either Maine or Northern New York for five or ten dollars.  Bea=
rs occasionally stray=20

down the Green Mountains into Western Massachusetts, where they inhabit the=
 Hoosac=20

about the=20

mountain all summer and had given two belated pedestrians a lively sprint o=
nly the night before=20

his Waterloo.  Being emboldened by the seeming servility of the neighborhoo=
d, bruin finally went=20

to a farmhouse and, forcing the kitchen door, marched boldly into the well-=
ordered room to see=20

what they were going to have for dinner. While waiting for this meal, he am=
used himself by=20

tumbling the pots and pans about.  This enraged the thrifty housewife, who =
seized a double-

barreled shotgun standing in the corner and discharged both barrels simulta=
neously at the=20

intruder.  When the smoke cleared away, it was discovered that she had bagg=
ed a bear weighing=20

three hundred pounds.  The dancing bear of song and story, as well as of re=
al life, has long been=20

a month ago, Lothair, without=20

an acquaintance, was meditating his return to Oxford. Now he seemed to know=
 everybody who=20

was anybody. His table was overflowing with invitations to all the fine hou=
ses in town. First came=20

the routs and the balls; then, when he had been presented to the husbands, =
came the dinners. His=20

kind friends the Duchess and Lady St. Jerome were the fairies who had worke=
d this sudden scene=20

of enchantment. A single word from them, and London was at Lothair=E2=80=99=
s feet.  He liked it amazingly.=20

He quite forgot the conclusion at which he had arrived respecting society a=
 year ago, drawn from=20

his vast experience of the single party which he had then attended. Feeling=
s are different when=20

you know a great many persons, and every person is trying to please you; ab=
ove all, when there=20

are individuals whom you want to meet, and whom, if you do not meet, you be=
come restless.=20

Town was beginning to blaze. Broughams whirled and bright barouches glanced=
, troops of social=20

cavalry cantered and caracolled in morning rides, and the bells of prancing=
 ponies, lashed by=20

delicate hands, gingled in the laughing air. There were stoppages in Bond S=
treet, which seems to=20

cap the climax of civilisation, after crowded clubs and swarming parks.  Bu=
t the great event of the=20

season was the presentation of Lady Corisande. Truly our bright maiden of B=
renthani woke and=20

found herself famous. There are families whom everybody praises, and famili=
