gave him! Buster seemed to tower up so big that he looked like a giant of a=
 bear.  With a snort of=20

fear, White Tail turned and sprang out of the trail, clearing a clump of bu=
shes in a beautiful jump,=20

and calling to Young Black Buck to follow. The latter didn=E2=80=99t need t=
his advice, for he was already out=20

of the trail, running for dear life.  Now back in the broad trail, Buster, =
who had been nearly as much=20

surprised as they, suddenly roared with glee, his fat sides shaking and wob=
bling. =E2=80=9CHo! Ho!=E2=80=9D he=20

laughed. =E2=80=9CWhat a scare I gave them! And I didn=E2=80=99t open my mo=
uth. I wonder what they=E2=80=99d done if I=E2=80=99d=20

roared like this.=E2=80=9D  He let out a roar that shook the leaves off the=
 bushes, and made White Tail and=20

Young Black Buck run harder than ever. To them it seemed as if that roar wa=
s trying to catch=20

them, and they couldn=E2=80=99t dodge its=20


_
nothing to prevent it; and this was undoubtedly a help to the progress of t=
he new creed, but it=20

could not have been the cause of its victory.  In all these reasons the rel=
igion itself is left out of the=20

question. Decidedly Islam itself was the main cause of its triumph. By some=
 strange intuition=20

Mohammad succeeded in finding the one form of Monotheism that has ever comm=
ended itself to=20

any wide section of the Eastern world. It was only a remnant of the Jews th=
at learned to worship=20

the one God of the prophets after the hard lessons of the Captivity. Christ=
ianity has never gained a=20

hold upon the East. Islam not only was at once accepted (partly in earnest,=
 partly in name, but=20

accepted) by Arabia, Syria, Persia, Egypt, Northern Africa, and Southern Sp=
ain at its first outburst,=20

but, with the exception of Spain, it has never lost its vantage-ground; it =
has seen no country that=20

has once embraced its doctrine turn to another faith; it has added great mu=
ltitudes in India and=20

China and Turkestan to its subjects; and in quite recent times it has been =
spreading in wide and=20

swiftly--following waves over Africa, and has left but a small part of that=
 vast continent unconverted=20

to its creed. Admitting the mixed causes that contributed to the rapidity o=
f the first torrent of=20

Mohammadan conquest, they do not account for the duration of Islam. There m=
ust be something=20

in the religion itself to explain its persistence and increase, and to acco=
unt for its present hold over=20

so large a proportion of the dwellers on the earth.  Men trained in Europea=
n ideas of religion have=20

always found a difficulty in understanding the fascination which the Muslim=
 faith has for so many=20

minds in the East. 'There is no god but God, and Mohammad  But, of course, =
Buster wasn=E2=80=99t=20

pursuing them. In the first place, he knew he couldn=E2=80=99t overtake the=
m, and in the second he wasn=E2=80=99t=20

particularly hungry and rarely killed deer or bucks. He was too kind-hearte=
d for that. But he did=20

enjoy a joke, and he thought it was a huge one to scare them half out of th=
eir wits.  White Tail and=20

Young Black Buck ran without knowing which way they were going. In fact the=
y might have run=20

straight into the camp of the man hunters if they hadn=E2=80=99t been stopp=
ed by the sudden baying of the=20

dogs.  This time the dogs were so close that they couldn=E2=80=99t expect t=
o throw them off their scent. In=20

fact, one of them saw White Tail=E2=80=99s head, and immediately gave the s=
ignal. He rushed for them with=20

wild yelps of delight, and two others followed him.  The two bucks swung ar=
ound in another=20

direction, and ran pell-mell through the woods. The fear of the dogs made t=
hem forget Buster.=20

Indeed White Tail realized his mistake now. He knew that Buster could not o=
vertake him in a race,=20

but the dogs of the man hunters might. They would follow them night and day=
 until exhaustion=20

killed one or the other.  =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re in for it now,=E2=80=9D Wh=
ite Tail said to his companion, breathing hard.=20

=E2=80=9CThe dogs are fresh, and we=E2=80=99re not. We must find a river to=
 throw them off our scent.=E2=80=9D  But finding a=20

river in a strange woods was not an easy thing to do. So far as they knew t=
here was no river there.=20

They were completely turned around, and hardly knew which direction to take=
 to reach home.=20

Young Black Buck soon began to show signs of weariness, and his lame leg hu=
rt him again. In=20

vain White Tail urged him on, but he couldn=E2=80=99t run any faster. The d=
ogs would certainly soon=20

overtake him.  Then White Tail did a magnanimous thing. He=20


_
is His Prophet.' There is nothing in this, they say, to move the heart. Yet=
 this creed has stirred an=20

enthusiasm that has never been surpassed. Islam has had its martyrs, its se=
lf-tormentors, its=20

recluses, who have renounced all that life offered and have accepted death =
with a smile for the=20

sake of the faith that was in them. It is idle to say the eternity of happi=
ness will explain this. The=20

truest martyrs of Islam, as well as of Christianity, did not die to gain pa=
radise. And if they did, the=20

belief in the promises of the creed must follow the hearty belief in the cr=
eed. Islam must have=20

possessed a companion behind to be pulled down by the dogs, while he escape=
d. No, no, that=20

would never do for one who some day expected to be leader of the herd!  =E2=
=80=9CYoung Black Buck,=E2=80=9D he=20

said, running along by the side of the panting creature, =E2=80=9Cyou run s=
traight on as hard as you can.=20

I=E2=80=99m going to stop here until the dogs see me. Then I=E2=80=99ll lea=
d them off to the left. So long as they can=20

see me they=E2=80=99ll follow me and forget the scent. When I get them far =
enough away I=E2=80=99ll run faster, and=20

get away from them. You understand?=E2=80=9D  Young Black Buck nodded his h=
ead. He was too tired to=20

reply in words. =E2=80=9CThen go on! I=E2=80=99ll wait=20
