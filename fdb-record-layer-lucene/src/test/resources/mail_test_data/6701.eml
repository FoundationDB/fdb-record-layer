'e, 'give it to 'im.' I've got the letter the wisest in creation.  Far be i=

otherwise, for he does not know.  Okematan is a child!  His eyes are only b=

self-depreciative modes of address, gazed at him with equal solemnity, not =

surprise, though the latter feeling was carefully concealed.  "When the las=

Cree braves was held on the Blue-Pine Ridge," continued Okematan, "the chie=
