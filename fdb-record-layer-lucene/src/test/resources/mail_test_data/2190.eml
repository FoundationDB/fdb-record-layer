This intrepidity is so much the more striking, as at eight leagues distance, the crocodiles of the Rio Tisnao are extremely timid, and little dangerous. The manners of animals vary in the _
people, but her own experience was strictly limited to school. Here in Capri, for the first time she 

tasted the delights of which she had often dreamed, and found herself cordially included in a 

charmed circle. Though the Beverleys were mainly responsible for thus taking her up, the 

Camerons also offered much kindness. "The Cameron Clan" as they called themselves, consisted 

of father, mother, Jess, and two brothers, Angus and Stewart, and almost every evening the young 

folk would meet at their villa and gather round a wood fire in the salon. Though the days were so 

warm the nights were chilly, and it was cheerful to watch the blazing logs. What times they had 

together! It was an established rule that everybody contributed some item to the general 

entertainment, and in spite of fierce denials even the least accomplished were compelled to 

perform. It brought out quite unexpected talent. Peachy, who had always declared her music 

"wasn't up to anything," charmed the company by lilting darkie melodies or pathetic Indian songs, 

Captain Preston remembered conjuring tricks which he had learned in India, Mr. Roper proved a 

genius at relating short stories, and Mrs. Cameron could recite old ballads with the fervor of a 

medieval minstrel. The walls of distinction is to be made between rahd, thunder, and rahadh, the 

electrical fish; and that this latter word means simply that which causes trembling.)  We left the 

town of Calabozo on the 24th of March, highly satisfied with our stay, and the experiments we had 

made on an object so worthy of the attention of physiologists. I had besides obtained some good 

observations of the stars; and discovered with surprise, that the errors of maps amounted here 

also to a quarter of a degree of latitude. No person had taken an observation before me on this 

spot; and geographers, magnifying as usual the distance from the coast to the islands, have 

carried back beyond measure all the localities towards the south.  As we advanced into the 

southern part of the Llanos, we found the ground more dusty, more destitute of herbage, and more 

cracked by the effect of long drought. The palm-trees disappeared by degrees. The thermometer 

kept, from eleven in the morning till sunset, at 34 or 35 degrees. The calmer the air appeared at 

eight or ten feet high, the more we were enveloped in those whirlwinds of dust, caused by the little 

currents of air that sweep the ground. About four o'clock in the afternoon, we found a young Indian 

girl stretched upon the savannah. She was

declaimed "Fair Helen of Kirconnell," "The Lament of the Border Widow," "Bartrum's Dirge," or 

"The Braes o' Yarrow."  "Modern people want more poetry in their veins," she insisted. "I've no 

patience with the stuff most of them read. There's more romance in one of those stories of ancient 

times than you'd find in a whole boxful of the latest library books. about twelve or thirteen years of 

age. Exhausted with fatigue and thirst, her eyes, nostrils, and mouth filled with dust, she breathed 

with a rattling in her throat, and was unable to answer our questions. A pitcher, overturned, and 

half filled with sand, was lying at her side. Happily one of our mules was laden with water; and we 

roused the girl from her lethargic state by bathing her face, and forcing her to drink a few drops of 

wine. She was at

the language to clothe them in. I'm a century or two too late. I ought to have lived when the world 

was younger."  If his wife adored her native ballads Mr. Cameron, on his part, had a good stock of 

Scottish songs, and would trill them out in surrounded by so many persons; but by degrees she 

took courage, and conversed with our guides. She judged, from the position of the sun, that she 

must have remained during several hours in that state of lethargy. We could not prevail on her to 

mount one of our beasts of burden, and she would not return to Uritucu. She had been in service

Dundee," "Charlie is my Darling," and "Over the Sea to Skye."  "There's a ring about Jacobite 

melodies that absolutely grips you," said Mrs. Beverley, begging for "Wha wad na fecht for at a 

neighbouring farm; and she had been discharged, because at the end of a long sickness she was 

less able to work than before. Our menaces and prayers were alike fruitless; insensible to 

suffering, like the rest of her race, she persisted in her resolution of going to one of the

beautiful girl in 1745, and sat on a balcony to watch her prince ride into Faircaster. The cavalcade 

came to a halt under her window and 'Charlie' looked up and saw her, and asked her to dance at 

the ball that was being given that night in the town. She was greatly set up by the honor, and 

handed the sand from her pitcher, and filled it with water. She resumed her way along the steppe, 

before we had remounted our horses, and was soon separated from us by a cloud of dust. During 

the night we forded the Rio Uritucu, which abounds with a breed of crocodiles remarkable for their 

ferocity. We were advised to prevent our dogs from going to drink in the rivers, for it often happens 

that the
