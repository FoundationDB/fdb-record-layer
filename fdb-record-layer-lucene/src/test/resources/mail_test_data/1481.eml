the wounded came by I called my section to attention, the compliment due to=
 wounded men paid=20

by units drawn up.  We drew our sandbags in the usual way by requisitioning=
 for five thousand and=20

getting one thousand. Always ask for more than you expect to get.  As we ca=
me into Ypres, a=20

military policeman on duty told me it was unhealthy to go the usual way thr=
ough the Market=20

Square, because the shelling was bad in that part of the town, so I spread =
the machines out and=20

started on down a side street. We were getting on finely and I was congratu=
lating myself on getting=20

through, when two houses, hit from the back, collapsed across the street in=
 front of my machine.=20

Without any ceremony I turned my machine back along the street which we had=
 come and went=20

through the Market Square down the Lille road, under the gate, being follow=
ed by my section.=20

About four hundred yards down I stopped; holding my solo motor cycle betwee=
n my legs, standing=20

up, I looked back. I counted my machines as they came up. If it hadn't been=
 so scary, it really=20

would have been funny, to see these machines coming down the road through s=
hell holes and=20

over piles of bricks, as fast as the drivers could make them go. The men we=
re hanging on for dear=20

life and the machines rocked from side to side, but they were all there.  D=
own the road we went to=20

the houses; there we parked the machines and unpacked. A guard was placed o=
ver them and the=20

rest of us marched down to the trenches.                    ---------------=
----------------------  An officer has=20

to buy all his own equipment and is allowed two hundred and fifty dollars b=
y the Government=20

towards the cost. An officer carries a revolver, but all junior officers as=
 soon as possible acquire a=20

rifle. The men of a "salvage company" were collecting all the rifles, bayon=
ets, and parts of=20

equipment near where I was to-day and I managed to get a Lee-Enfield (Briti=
sh rifle) in good=20

shape. I felt that I would like to have a rifle and bayonet handy. I found =
a good-looking bayonet=20

sticking in the side of a sandbag wall. It looked lonely. The scabbard I am=
 using was resting in a=20

loft of a deserted brewery. I am now complete with rifle, bayonet, and scab=
bard.=20

[Illustration]                                   "Wipers"   Sometimes you s=
ee a man smashed about in a=20

terrible way, such a mess that you think he is a goner; he may recover. Ano=
ther man may have=20

just a small wound and will die. A bullet hitting a man in the head will sm=
ash it as attempts, and=20

have taken advantage of the facility afforded, by the existence of this fir=
e, for ventilating the mines,=20

in the following manner:--They opened a passage from their present, to the =
old deserted, works;=20

this they can open or shut, by means of a close door. As the old works are =
very near the fire, the=20

air in them becomes very much rarified by the heat; and probably a consider=
able portion of it is=20

consumed (as the principal pabulum for the combustion,) and a partial vacuu=
m is produced. When=20

the air in their present works, therefore, becomes impure, they open the do=
or, and a strong current=20

rushes into the old works; its place is again supplied with fresh air throu=
gh the shafts. Previous to=20

the adoption of this mode of ventilation, they experienced great inconvenie=
nce from carbonic acid=20

gas; and some of the workmen had been killed by an explosion of carburetted=
 hydrogen gas.=20

Since this mode has been adopted, they have experienced no inconvenience at=
 all from noxious=20

gases. On inquiry, I was told that the substances passed through, in gettin=
g to the coal, varied in=20

the different pits. As far, however, as I could learn by inquiry, and an ex=
amination of the heaps of=20

rubbish, the following substances, in the order in which they stand, have b=
een found in Heth's=20

pits:--mould, clay, gravel, fuller's earth, sandstone, (at first extremely =
coarse and friable, but=20

becoming more compact and hard, and having an appearance somewhat stratifie=
d as they=20

descended,) gray and bluish clay slate, hard bluish sandstone, shale, or, a=
s they term it, shiver,=20



white micaceous sandstone, extremely hard; blue slate and shale intermixed,=
 black slate, and then=20

the coal. The depth of these strata differed so much in different pits, tha=
t their individual thickness=20

could not be ascertained. Vegetable impressions are very common in the slat=
e next the coal; and=20

they have found the impression of a fish. Pieces of pure charcoal, in the f=
orm of sticks, or logs, are=20

frequently found in or on the coal. In sinking one of the pits they met wit=
h a perpendicular column,=20

8 inches in diameter, extending through the slate into the coal; in all abo=
ut 50 feet. Its surface was=20

distinctly serrated, and at intervals of about 2 inches it appeared jointed=
, breaking easily at the=20

joints. For the want of a better name I must call it a "lusus natur=C3=A6;"=
 for it is neither clay-slate nor=20

mica-slate, nor shale, nor sandstone; but appears to be composed of them al=
l. Masses of a black=20

oxide of iron are sometimes=20


_
effectually as a sledge-hammer. Once a man leaves your unit, wounded, you d=
on't see him again.=20

You get a fresh draft.  No one thinks of peace here. Germany must be put in=
 a similar state to=20

Belgium first.  We never travel anywhere without our smoke helmets; they co=
me right over our=20

heads and are tucked into our shirts; they have two glass eye-pieces. When =
we have them on we=20

look like the old Spanish gentleman who ran the "Star Chamber." Helmets mus=
t always be ready=20

to put on instantly. Gas is a matter of seconds in coming over. The helmets=
 are better than=20

respirators, but have to be constantly inspected. A small hole, or if one i=
s allowed to dry, means a=20

casualty.  Storm brewing. Flies bad, driven in by the wind. Nature goes on =
just the same. I=20

suppose that this farm would be just as fly-ridden in an ordinary summer. D=
uring the bombarding=20

yesterday I noticed swallows flying about quite unconcerned. Corn, mostly s=
elf-planted, grows=20

right up to the trenches. Cabbages grow wild. Communicating trenches run ri=
ght through fields of=20

and from its weight and hardness the miners very properly call it ironstone=
. Iron pyrites are very=20

abundant in the slate, and the heaps of rubbish are white with the sulphate=
 of alumine; yellow=20

ochre is found among the rubbish, but I could not ascertain its relative po=
sition with any precision.=20

The side of the hill at the pits is covered with quartz pebbles; some of wh=
ich are as transparent=20

and beautiful as I ever saw. The country, for several miles around the pits=
, (i. e. as far as I have=20

seen,) appears to be entirely destitute of rocks or pebbles, and is covered=
 with a light sandy soil. I=20

am unable to inform you of the number of hands employed at, or of the quant=
ity of coal annually=20

furnished from, these pits, as a part of my notes has, by an accident, been=
 rendered illegible.=20

Thus, sir, I have endeavoured to comply with my promise of giving you an ac=
count of the coal=20

pits.[17] In doing this, I have _only_ attempted to state facts as they exi=
sted; although I have no=20

doubt that my imperfect acquaintance with geology has=20


_
poppies and field daisies, and there are often hundreds of little frogs in =
the bottom of the trenches.=20

-------------------------------------  A trip to No Man's Land is an excurs=
ion which you never forget. It=20

varies in width and horrors. My impression was similar to what I should fee=
l being on Broadway=20

without any clothes--a naked feeling. Forty-seven and one half inches of ea=
rth are necessary to=20

stop a bullet, and it's nice to have that amount of dirt omissions which mi=
ght have been interesting.=20

To the same cause must be attributed the use of language not always strictl=
y scientific, and a=20

method less exact than might have been desired. With all its imperfections,=
 however, if you can,=20

from the mass of facts, cull any one which may be useful or interesting, I =
shall be fully=20

compensated by the pleasure of having furnished it, for any trouble I may h=
ave been at in doing=20

so. And, if at any time I should be able to furnish you=20


_
in between the lines or hang up on the wire; they don't look pretty after t=
hey have been out some=20

time. It's a pleasant job to have to get their identification disks, and we=
 have to search the bodies=20

of the enemy dead for papers and even buttons so that we can know what unit=
 is in front of us.=20

Flowers grow in between, butterflies play together, and birds nest in the w=
ire. When the grass=20

becomes too high it has to be cut, because otherwise it would prevent good =
observation. In some=20

places grass doesn't have a chance to even take root, let alone grow. The s=
hells take care of that.=20

I managed to get a translation of a diary kept by a German soldier who fell=
 on the field. Below is an=20

exact translation and gives the point of view of a man in the trenches on t=
he other side of the line.=20

He was writing his diary at the same time I was writing mine, and we were b=
oth fighting around the=20

salient at Ypres, Hooge being on the point of the salient farthest east. Th=
is part, which was once a=20

place of beauty which people came long distances to see, is now like a grea=
t muddy Saragossa=20

Sea which at the height of its fury has suddenly become frozen with the tor=
tured limbs of trees and=20

men, and wreckage and reeking smells, until it can again lash itself in wil=
d fury into or geology of=20

this part of the country, I hope you will let me know it.     ART. IV. _Ske=
tch of the Geology and=20

Mineralogy of a part of the State of Indiana, communicated in a letter to t=
he Editor, by Mr._ W. B.=20

STILSON.     LOUISVILLE, (Ken.) August 11, 1818.    _Dear Sir_,  I have emp=
loyed a short period=20

of leisure in passing over a portion of the state of Indiana. Among other o=
bjects, I was not wholly=20

inattentive to the mineralogical and geological features of the country. I =
now, with diffidence,=20

transmit to you the result of my inquiries.   SKETCH, &c.  The secondary fo=
rmation of the state of=20

Indiana is abundantly evident. The surface of the soil is undulating, and m=
arked with few=20

elevations which deserve the name of mountains. The rocks are sandstone, li=
mestone, and clay-

slate; all of which are disposed in horizontal strata. The sandstone presen=
ts nothing remarkable in=20

its appearance. Its colours are various shades of gray and brown. The princ=
ipal hills are of this=20

formation. The principal colours of the limestone are blue and gray, and th=
eir various mingled and=20

intermediate shades. Its secondary formation is very manifest from its almo=
st earthy appearance.=20

In innumerable instances, the limestone rocks contain immense quantities of=

illed at Hooge on=20

August 9th, 1915._  On May 10, we were told to prepare for the journey to t=
he front. Each man=20

received his service ammunition and two days' rations, and we then started =
with heavy packs on=20

our backs and our water-bottles full of coffee. After a long march we reach=
ed our reserve position,=20

where we were put into rest billets for two days in wooden huts hidden in a=
 wood. We could hear=20

from here the noise of the shells coming through the air.  On May 13, we mo=
ved into the great=20

the common escallop-

shell of the ocean. Owing to the easy decomposition of these rocks, and the=

their strata, they afford many subterranean passages for water. A considera=
ble stream, called Lost=20

River, runs into a cave in the side of a precipitous hill; and, after a pas=
sage of 6 or 7 miles under=20
