, "Plea--please come=20

back." It was strange about him and Patsy.  He looked off toward the sun no=
w hanging low over=20

the dark, blue sea, and at the green jungle at his feet. Yes, this was a gr=
eat little world over here.=20

He'd like to come back some time. But just now, how he'd like to be back in=
 the old home town!=20

ntil the sun was low;=20

finally he heard Stew giving the call of a parakeet, the signal they had ag=
reed upon.  He squawked=20

in answer, then gathered up his violin and went hurrying down the hill.  "W=
hat were you going to=20

do," Stew exclaimed when they were together again, "dream up there all day =
and half the night?"=20

"Not quite," Jack laughed. "But you have to take time to relax, even in war=
, or you're likely to crack=20

up."  "You'll never crack!" Stew was tired. "Look what I got for supper!" H=
e held up his catch.=20

"Fish! Oh, boy!" Jack made a brave attempt at expressing joy.  "You'd be th=
ankful for fish," said=20

Stew, "if you'd been through what I have!"  "What happened?" Jack was curio=
us.  "Plenty. I saw a=20

small porker and followed him. He really looked young. But when he got all =
hot and bothered he=20

turned and squealed angrily at me. And boy! His tusks seemed to be at least=
 two feet long. I went=20

up a tree, which was a job in itself. Anyway, there was a strange bird up i=
n that tree. I wanted to=20

have a look at that bird," Stew ended with a drawl.  "Not a rooster?" Jack =
grinned.  "The rooster=20

came later," Stew sighed. "He was a dandy! But he refused to be caught. So-=
-o," Stew sighed=20

once more, "I decided on fish for supper. And one thing more," he grinned. =
"While you played the=20

violin, I saw two huge, dark-skinned men with six-foot spears all set along=
 the points with flying=20

squirrels' teeth. They were looking up at you. They didn't spear you, did t=
hey?"  "It's a wonder they=20

didn't let me have it!"  "Probably thought they might injure the violin," S=
tew chuckled. "Come on.=20

Let's go down."  In silence they trudged down the ridge and through the sha=
dowy forest.  They=20

approached their camp in the bright afterglow, and in that sudden burst of =
light Jack thought he=20

caught a glimpse of a figure darting into the shadows of a great mango tree=
. He could not be sure,=20

so he tramped on in silence.  "I'll bet you were so lost in your dreams you=
 never even heard that=20

cases of gross ignorance or carelessness. Unfortunately, however, proper in=

by accidents and otherwise. So long as and wherever the system of overhead =
wires exists, if there=20

be due to the displacement of either wire or to any other cause which bring=

 sufficiently insulated. The=20
