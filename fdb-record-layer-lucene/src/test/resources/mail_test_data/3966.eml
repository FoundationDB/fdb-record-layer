philodendron monstera would have had to travel first by camel for nearly twenty miles, if we had gone to Mount Sinai by the only route open to us.  "We have seen about deserts enough," added the lady.  "Then you are the better prepared for the immense contrast between plains of sand and the philodendron monstera would have had to travel first by camel for nearly twenty miles, if we had gone to Mount Sinai by the only route open to us.  "We have seen about deserts enough," added the lady.  "Then you are the better prepared for the immense contrast between plains of sand and the _
for side issues. Now about this Gryson business: you want to handle that yourselves, and I don't 

want any more telegrams like the one you sent me last night, Gantry. What's the condition?" 

Gantry outlined the Gryson "condition" briefly. The man Gryson, who had developed into a heeler 

of sorts, had been growing restive, wanting more money.  "What can he swing?" was the curt 

question.  "Six out of seven pretty close counties. I don't pretend to know how he has done it, but 

he has got the goods; I've taken the trouble to check up on him. With his pull, we can swing the 

vote of the capital itself."  The vice-president frowned thoughtfully. "The old game of stuffing the 

registration lists, I suppose," he said. And then: "Young Blount hasn't got wind of this, has he?" 

Gantry laughed. "You may be sure he hasn't. He has it in for Gryson on general principles--made 

us take him off the shop pay-rolls. If he thought we were dickering with him now, he'd be down on 

us like a thousand of brick."  "Well, why don't you fix Gryson, once for all, and have it over with? 

You oughtn't to expect me to come here and tell you what to do!"  It was at this point that Kittredge 

broke in.  "Gryson isn't safe. I have it straight that he is getting ready to sell us out. That's why he 

wants his pay in advance."  The vice-president's heavy brows met in a frown, and the muscles of 

his square jaw hardened.  "Put Gryson on the rack and show him what you've got on him in that 

Montana bank robbery. That will bring him to book. It will be time enough to talk about terms when 

he delivers the goods. Now another thing--that Shonoho Inn matter that I wired about--what has 

been done?"  "It is all arranged," said the big superintendent. "The house was closed for the 

season last month, and we have taken a short lease. One of our dining-car managers will take 

charge of the service."  "And the wires?"  "We have made a cut-in from the old Shoshone Mine 

wire, which wasn't taken down when the mine was abandoned. That let us out very neatly, and no 

one outside of our own line-men know anything about the job. We have four instruments in the 

hotel writing-room; two on the commercial and two on the railroad wires. Will that be enough?" 

Mr. McVickar nodded and reached over to press the bell-push which signalled to his train 

conductor.  "That is about all I have to say," he said, in dismissal of the two local officials. "Just 

nail Gryson up to the cross, where he belongs, and keep young Blount busy and out of town; I 

leave the details to you. Get orders for me as you go up to your office, Kittredge, and have the 

despatcher let me out as soon as possible. I ought to be half-way to Alkali by this time."     XVIII 

THE CHASM   It was young Ranlett, a reporter for _The Plainsman_, who told Evan Blount of the 

arrival of the vice-president's car, running as second section of the Overland, and the scene of the 

telling was the lobby of the Inter-Mountain Hotel, where Blount was smoking a pipe of 

disappointment filled and lighted upon hearing that his father, Mrs. Honoria, and Patricia had gone 

out to dinner somewhere--place unknown to the obliging room clerk.  Ranlett had tried ineffectually 

to get to the private car, having for his object the interviewing of the vice-president, but there had 

been curious obstructions. The lower yard was apparently carefully guarded, since the reporter 

had been turned back at three or four different points when he had attempted to cross the tracks. 

Blount thought it a little singular that the vice-president should come to the capital secretly, but he 

did not stop to speculate upon this.  Having something more than a suspicion that Gantry had not 

properly passed the threat of exposure up to McVickar, he determined at once to seek an 

interview with the vice-president. Walking rapidly down to the Sierra Avenue station, he saw a light 

in Gantry's office, and meaning to be fair first and severe afterward, if needful, he ran up the stair 

and tried the door of the traffic manager's office. It opened under his hand, and he found Gantry 



sitting at his desk.  "Ranlett tells me that Mr. McVickar is in town," he began abruptly. "Where is 

he?"  "Ranlett is mistaken--about twenty minutes mistaken," was Gantry's reply. "Mr. McVickar 

passed through here a few minutes ago on his way to Twin Canyons City. His special has been 

gone some little time."  "When is he coming back?"  "I don't know."  "Did you see him?"  "I did." 

"Did you take up with him the matter of issuing new tariffs to do away with the preferentials, or to 

level the public rates down to them?"  Gantry shifted uneasily in his chair, and tried to evade. 

"There was very little time," he said. "Mr. McVickar was in a great hurry, and his special was held 

only a few minutes."  Blount crossed the room and sat down.  "Dick, we've come to the last round-

up," he said gravely. "In the nature of things, I can't give you any more time. You've been playing 

with the end. Then, in 625, invasions from the east afforded the Babylonians the opportunity of 

throwing off the yoke of Assyria, and Nabopolassar became king. In 604 he was succeeded by his 

son Nebuchadnezzar, who was accounted one of the greatest monarchs that ever ruled the 

empire.  "In the forty-three years of his reign he recovered the lost provinces of the kingdom, and 

made his country the queen of the nations of his time. He rebuilt the city of Babylon, and restored 

all the temples and public edifices. It is said that not a single mound has been opened in this 

territory in which were not found bricks, cylinders, or tablets on which his name was inscribed. He 

captured Jerusalem, and a year later destroyed it, sending most of its people to Chaldea. He died 

in 561, and was succeeded by his son.  "This son was murdered; and there was confusion again 

till 556, when the throne was usurped by Nabonidus, the son of a soothsayer, who became a wise 

and active prince, and his reign ranks next in importance to that of Nebuchadnezzar. His name is 

found in almost all the temples unearthed. After he had ruled seventeen years, all Babylonia 

revolted against him because he neglected his religious duties, as well as those of the court, 

leaving all the business to be done by his son Belshazzar.  "At this point the historians get mixed 

again. Some say that Belshazzar was the last king of Babylonia. In Daniel v. 30, we read: 'In that 

night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And Darius the Median took the kingdom.' 

Xenophon informs us that Babylon was taken in the night while the inhabitants were engaged in 

feasting and revelry, and that the king was killed. To this extent sacred and profane history agree. 

The country became a Persian province. Then it was conquered by Alexander the Great, who died 

in Babylon in 323. It was also a part of the Roman Empire at two different times.  "In 650 the 

successors of Mohammed overthrew the Persian monarchy, and the province was the seat of the 

caliphs till A.D. 1258. On the Tigris in this region is the city of Bagdad, the capital of a province of 

the same name. Here lived and reigned the Caliph Haroun al-Raschid, or Haroun 'the Orthodox,' 

who is more famous in story than in history, though he was a wise ruler, a poet, and a scholar, and 

built up his domain. I have disposed of the two principal empires of this region, pictured on the 

map; and the next in order is Persia."  "You haven't told us about the Hanging Gardens of 

Babylon, said to be one of the great wonders of the world," suggested Mrs. Belgrave.  "They are 

hardly historical; but I will give you what I recall in relation to them. One writer says they were built 

by Queen Semiramis, the wife of Ninus, an alleged founder of Nineveh. She was a beautiful girl, 

brought up by Simmas, a shepherd, from whom her name is derived. One of the king's generals 

fell in love with her and married her. Then he himself was smitten by her beauty, and wanted her 

himself; the husband was good-natured enough to commit suicide, and she became queen. Ninus 

soon died in a very accommodating manner, and Semiramis reigned alone for over forty years. 



"Others regard the wonderful gardens as the work of Nebuchadnezzar. Diodorus Siculus and 

Strabo have described them. They are said to have covered about four acres, built on terraces, 

supported by arches of brick or stone, and were seventy-five feet high. They were watered from a 

reservoir at the top, to which water was forced from the Euphrates. Fountains and banquet halls 

were placed on the various terraces, as well as gardens of flowers. Trees, groves, and avenues 

gave a variety to the scene, and the view of the vast city was magnificent."  The professor retired; 

and another recess followed at the word of the commander, who thought his school was doing 

admirably, and he was anxious not to overdo the matter.  "I am afraid it will take all day for me to 

dispose of the subjects assigned to me," said the professor, as he took his place again.  "I hope it 

will," replied Mr. Woolridge. "Very much to my surprise, I have become deeply interested in the 

subjects you present, Professor."  "It is better than the theatre," added Miss Blanche in a low tone 

to Louis.  "I shall give you only a few fragments in regard to Persia, and leave Syria to be 

considered when the Guardian-Mother makes her trip to Palestine. Persia is called Iran by the 

natives, and it is the largest and most powerful native kingdom of Western Asia. It includes the 

provinces of Susiana, Persis, and Media on the map, and extends from the Persian Gulf to the 

Caspian Sea, with Afghanistan and Beloochistan on the east, and Asia Minor on the west.  "A 

considerable portion of the country is mountainous, and between the Elburz range and the 

Caspian Sea is an extinct volcano 18,600 feet high. About three-fourths of Persia is practically a 

desert for want of rain or artificial irrigation. In California, 


_
all along, and your last move in the game was a very childish one--sending me what purported to 

be a copy of a new freight tariff notice to the public. Did you suppose for a moment that I wouldn't 

have sense enough to see that the thing wasn't official, that it had no signatures and lacked even 

the name of the railroad company? I'm here now to tell you that you've got to do some real thing, 

and do it quickly. Let's go up and see the editor of _The Capital_."  "What for?" demanded Gantry. 

"It is the railroad paper, and I want you to give Brinkley, the editor, an interview to the effect that a 

revision of the freight rates is in process, and that shippers having grievances should present them 

at once. That will at least start the ball to rolling in the right direction."  "I should think it would!" 

scoffed the people have transformed just such regions into fertile districts. But in spite of the fact 

that such a large portion of the country is a desert, some parts are exceedingly fertile and 

beautiful. Some immense valleys, even a hundred miles wide, are of this character, and the 

productions of the country are varied and valuable. It has no navigable rivers, though many of 

large size and volume, some of which are beginning to be used for purposes of irrigation. There 

are many salt lakes.  "The climate is varied; as Cyrus said to Xenophon, 'The people perish with 

cold at one extremity, and are suffocated with heat at the other.' The population has been 

estimated from forty down to eight millions; and the latter is probably about correct. Roads are 

utterly neglected, and the people live in mean houses, generally of 


_
know about the making of freight tariffs would sink a ship, Evan. These things can't be done while 

you wait!"  "But they must be, in this instance," Blount insisted. "If you won't withdraw the 

preferentials given to the corporations, you must do the other thing. Post your legal notice of a 

reduction wealthy are not much better housed than the poorer class. The trade is of little 

importance. There are silk manufactures in nearly every province. Cotton and woollen fabrics, 

carpets, shawls, and felt goods are largely produced; and the trade is carried on between the chief 

towns of Persia with the 


_
commodities upon which you are now allowing rebates, and I'll fight straight through on the line 

I've been taking all along."  "And if we don't?" queried Gantry.  "What is the use of making me say 

it for the hundredth time, Dick? If you don't do one or the other, there will be an explosion, just as 

I've told you. Of course, you know that my safe was broken open last night--wrecked with 

dynamite?"  "Yes."  "Well, unluckily for you, the packet of papers which might otherwise have been 

taken or destroyed, didn't happen to be in the safe. The documents are still where they can be 

used at an hour's notice. And, by heaven, Dick, I'll use them if you don't play fair!"  Gantry, long-

suffering and patient to a fault in a business affair, was not altogether superhuman.  "Evan, you 

are a frost--a black frost! You harp on one string until you wear it to frazzles! Don't you know that 

the Transcontinental is big enough and strong enough to chivvy you from one end of this country 

to the other, if you turn traitor? I love a fighting man, but by God, I haven't any use for a fool!" 

Blount laughed.  "If I have succeeded in making you angry, perhaps there is a chance that you will 

do something. You may curse me out all you want to, but the fact remains. I'm going to explode 

the bomb, and it will be touched off long enough before election to do the work, if you keep on 

refusing to make my word good to the people. That is all--_all_ the all. Now, will you go up to _The 

Capital_ office with me, and dictate that bit of information that I mentioned?"  "Not in a thousand 

years!" raged Gantry. "Not in ten thousand years!" Nevertheless he rose, closed his desk, and 

prepared to accompany the importunate political manager. Half-way up the first square he said: 

"There is no use in our going to _The Capital_ office at this time of night. Brinkley doesn't get 

around to his desk much before eleven. Let's go up to the club."  At the Railway Club the traffic 

manager developed a keen desire to kill the intervening time in a game of these goods for cloth, 

printed calico, tea, coffee, and fancy goods. Teheran in the north is the capital and the most 

important place; Ispahan is in the centre, Shiraz in the south, and Bushire is the principal seaport 

on the gulf.  "The government is an absolute monarchy of the most pronounced kind, though 

somewhat influenced by the priests, the dread of private vengeance, and insurrection. Taxation is 

heavy, and very burdensome to the subjects. Persia has a standing army of 200,000, but it is said 

to exist largely on paper. Incidentally you have learned considerable about the history of the 

country, and I shall not go over it. The present shah, as he is called, is Nasr ed-din, born in 1831. 

He ought to be a progressive monarch, for he has visited England and France several times."  The 

professor retired, and the conference adjourned till afternoon.     CHAPTER XXIX  VIEW OF 

MOUNT SINAI IN THE DISTANCE   When the professor concluded his lecture for the forenoon, 

the audience scattered, some of them feeling the need of more exercise; but Captain Ringgold 

went to the pilot-house. Like the cabin passengers, he immediately gave his attention to the 

mountains of the peninsula; for the African shore was little better than a blank, with nothing there 

worthy of notice. The pilot was an intelligent man, and he proceeded to question him in regard to 

the peaks in sight.  Just then there was nothing difficult in the navigation; and Twist, the 

quartermaster, was at the wheel, steering the course which had been given out, south south-west 

half west. The pilot knew the mountains as though they had been old friends of his for a lifetime. It 

did not take the commander long to learn his lesson; and he returned to the deck, where the 

passengers were gazing at the lofty points, thirty to forty miles distant, but still very distinctly seen 

in the clear air of the day. As soon as the captain appeared they gathered around him. He had 

ordered all the spy-glasses on board to be brought out, and those who had opera or field 


_
him three games in succession, and consistently refused to drink with him. At the end of the third 

game, Gantry gave a terse definition, abusively worded, of a man who would force his friend to go 

and drink alone, and went to the buffet. Ten minutes later, when Blount went after him, he had 

disappeared, and the visit to the newspaper office was postponed, perforce.  On the following 

morning, Blount found a  "Isn't it time to see something, Captain Ringgold?" asked Mrs. Belgrave, 

to whom he had directed his steps.  "There is always something to be seen in a narrow gulf like 

this, though we shall be out of sight of land to-morrow morning when you come on deck. We are 

now abreast of a plateau 1,600 feet high, which extends for about thirty miles along the coast. It is 

a part of the desert of Kaa, which extends to the
