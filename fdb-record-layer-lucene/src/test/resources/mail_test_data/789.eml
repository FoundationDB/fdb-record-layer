dracaena marginata fire my second barrel before the remaining elephant had =
turned; but Florian, with a three-ounce steel-tipped bullet, by a curious s=
hot at the hind quarters, injured the hip joint to such an extent that we c=
ould more than equal the elephant in many who would have been glad of an of=
fer from him, but they were ashamed to let him see it. After all, how could=
 they marry a man whom so many girls had refused?  On the eve of St. Andrew=
's any amount of lead was melted by the young girls of the dracaena margina=
ta fire my second barrel before the remaining elephant had turned; but Flor=
ian, with a three-ounce steel-tipped bullet, by a curious shot at the hind =
quarters, injured the hip joint to such an extent that we could more than e=
qual the elephant in many who would have been glad of an offer from him, bu=
t they were ashamed to let him see it. After all, how could they marry a ma=
n whom so many girls had refused?  On the eve of St. Andrew's any amount of=
 lead was melted by the young girls of the _
animals shoulder-deep in the river, which they were in the act of crossing =
to the opposite side, to=20

secure themselves in an almost impenetrable jungle of thorny nabbuk. The ag=
gageers advised=20

that we should return to the ford that we had already crossed, and, by repa=
ssing the river, we=20

should most probably meet the elephants, as they would not leave the thick =
jungle until the night.=20

Having implicit confidence than his father in time!"  Gregorics felt very v=
exed at being called mean,=20

and decided to take the very next opportunity to prove the contrary. The op=
portunity presented=20

itself in the form of a ball, given in aid of a hospital, and of which the =
Mayoress of the town was=20

patroness. The programme announced that though the tickets were two florins=
 each, any larger=20

sum would be gratefully accepted. So Pal=20


_
their directions, and we shortly recrossed the ford, and arrived upon a dry=
 portion of the river's=20

bed, banked by a dense thicket of nabbuk.  Jali now took the management of =
affairs. We all=20

dismounted, and sent the horses to a considerable distance, lest they shoul=
d by some noise=20

disturb the elephants. We shortly heard a cracking in the jungle on our two=
-florin ticket, thinking to=20

himself "They shan't say I am mean this time."  Upon that the members of th=
e committee put their=20

heads together and decided that Pal Gregorics was a tactless fellow. It was=
 the greatest=20

impertinence on his part to outbid the Mayor, and a baron to boot! Baron Ra=
dvanszky had given=20

ten florins for his ticket, and Gregorics=20


_
expected, the elephants were slowly advancing along the jungle on the bank =
of the river, and they=20

would pass exactly before us. We waited patiently in the bed of the river, =
and the cracking in the=20

jungle sounded closer as the herd evidently approached. The strip of thick =
thorny covert that=20

fringed the margin was in no place wider than half a mile--beyond that, the=
 country was open and=20

park-like, but at this season it was covered with parched grass from eight =
to ten feet high; the=20

elephants would, therefore, most probably remain in the jungle until driven=
 out.  In about a quarter=20

of an hour, we heard by the noise in the jungle, about a hundred down twent=
y. Why, it was an=20

insult! The son of a wine merchant! What things do happen in the nineteenth=
 century, to be sure!=20

Whatever Pal Gregorics did was wrong; if he quarrelled with some one and wo=
uld not give in, they=20

said he was a brawler; and if he gave in, he was a coward.  Though he had s=
tudied law, he did=20

nothing particular at first, only drove to his estate a mile or two out of =
the town and spent a few=20

hours shooting; or he went for a few days to Vienna, where he had a house i=
nherited from his=20

mother; and the rest of his time he spent in Besztercebanya.  "Pal Gregoric=
s," they said, "is a lazy=20

fellow; he does nothing useful from one=20


_
were directly opposite to us. I accordingly instructed Jali to creep quietl=
y by himself into the bush=20

and to bring me information of their position: to this he at once agreed.  =
In three or four minutes he=20

returned; he declared it impossible to use the sword, as the jungle was so =
dense that it would=20

check the blow, but that I could use the rifle, as the elephants were close=
 to us--he had seen three=20

standing together, between us and the main body of the herd. I told Jali to=
 lead me direct to the=20

spot, and, followed by Fiorian and to live?"  Pal heard this too, and quite=
 agreed with them that he=20

ought to get some work to do, and not waste his life as he was doing. Of co=
urse, every one should=20

earn the bread they eat. So he looked for some employment in the town. That=
 was enough to set=20

all the tongues wagging again. What? Gregorics wanted work in the town? Was=
 he not ashamed=20

of himself, trying to take the bread out of poor men's mouths, when he had =
plenty of cake for=20

himself? Let him leave the small amount of employment there was in the town=
 to those who=20


_
gun-bearers, I kept within a foot of my dependable little guide, who crept =
gently into the jungle; this=20

was intensely thick, and quite impenetrable, except in such places where el=
ephants and other=20

heavy animals had trodden numerous alleys. Along one of these force of this=
 argument, and gave=20

up his idea. He now turned his thoughts toward marriage, and determined to =
start a family; after all=20

that was as good an occupation as any other.  So he began to frequent vario=
us houses where=20

there were pretty girls to be met, and=20


_
quietly on one side, and pointed with his finger; I immediately observed tw=
o elephants looming=20

through the thick bushes about eight paces from me. One offered a temple sh=
ot, which I quickly=20

took with a Reilly No. 10, and floored it on the spot. The smoke step-broth=
ers, who were always in=20

hopes that the delicate little man would not live long, did their best to u=
pset his plans in this case=20

too. So Pal Gregorics got so many refusals one after the other, that he was=
 soon renowned in the=20

whole neighborhood.=20
