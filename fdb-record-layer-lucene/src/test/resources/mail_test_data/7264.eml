dracaena marginata she lay concealed like one of the forty thieves in the story of _Ali Baba_. She had one advantage, however, over the famous brigands.

announcement:  "They've called a meeting by the big Greek jar to-day at five. I heard Ruth tell 

Callie. What are you going to do about it?"  That was exactly the question which puzzled the 

Camellia Buds. It was one thing to obtain information and quite another to act upon it. If they went 

and interrupted the rival meeting they would have the satisfaction of routing the enemy but would 

be none the wiser. It was Peachy's diplomacy that pointed out a way.  "The Greek vase!" she said 

meditatively. "Yes, it's enormously big and I think I can manage it. Now, my dearies, don't you 

want to be real that faction; his name was Monteverde. I had him cut to pieces, as was just: for, 

believe me, Senor, wherever I am, people live according to the law. But the corruption of morals 

among the monks is so great in this land that it is necessary to chastise it severely. There is not an 

ecclesiastic here who does not think himself higher than the governor of a province. I beg of thee, 

great King, not to believe what the monks tell thee down yonder in Spain. They are always talking 

of the sacrifices they make, as well as of the hard and bitter life they are forced to lead in America: 

while they occupy

to other folks? Why? Because I've a little scheme on hand. I want to keep those girls well away 

from the lemon pergola until it's time for their precious meeting. Then they'll run up all 

unsuspecting, poor innocents, and find----"  "What will they find?"  "'A chiel amang them takin' 

notes!'" chuckled Peachy. "In other words yours truly will be hiding inside the big and the Indians 

hunt and fish for them every day. If they shed tears before thy throne, it is that thou mayest send 

them hither to govern provinces. Dost thou know what sort of life they lead here? Given up to 

luxury, acquiring possessions, selling the sacraments, being at once ambitious, violent, and 

gluttonous; such is the life they lead in America. The faith of

"Peachy! You can't!"  "Can't I? Great Scott! Do you think I'm going to let this beat me? You can 

just bet your last nickel I shall. Renie and Jess shall help to hide me, and the rest of you must 

watch the coast's clear till I'm safely inside. I tell you I'm crazy to try it. It'll be the frolic of my life." 

There was certainly no plan too madcap for Peachy to undertake. She revelled in anything 

venturesome or bizarre. dost not change all this, O King of Spain, thy government will not be 

stable.  "What a misfortune that the Emperor, thy father, should have conquered Germany at such 

a price, and spent, on that conquest, the money we procured for him in these very Indies! In the 

year 1559 the Marquis de Canete sent to the Amazon, Pedro de Ursua, a Navarrese, or rather a 

Frenchman: we sailed on the largest rivers of Peru till we came to a

she decreed, and resigned the courts that afternoon to Bertha, Mabel, Elsie, Ruth, Rosamonde, 

Winnie, Monica, and Callie, who fell readily into the trap prepared for them. Leaving this double set 

busy at tennis they fled to the opposite end of the garden.  The lemon pergola was a sheltered 

walk that led down a flight of marble steps to a small fountain. There was a shady nook here with 

bushes of bamboo, and a tree with a sweet flower like honeysuckle, and little red roses, and a 

border of Parma violets, and a seat made of bright green tiles--altogether a very retired and 

pleasant and suitable spot in which to hold a committee meeting. Exactly behind the seat stood an 

enormous jar of terra-cotta, colored red, and decorated with Greek figures in gulf of fresh water. 

We had already gone three hundred leagues when we killed that bad and ambitious captain. We 

chose a caballero of Seville, Fernando de Guzman, for king: and we swore fealty to him, as is 

done to thyself. I was named quarter-master-general: and because I did not consent to all he 

willed, he wanted to kill me. But I killed this new king, the captain of his guards, his lieutenant-

general, his chaplain, a woman, a knight of the order of Rhodes, two ensigns, and five or six 

domestics of the pretended king. I then resolved to punish thy ministers and thy auditors 

(counsellors of the audiencia). I named captains and sergeants: these again wanted to kill me, but 

I had them all hanged. In the midst of these adventures we navigated

black silhouette, rather blurred and rubbed off, but still distinguishable. No doubt its original use 

had been to store water, wine, or olive-oil, but nowadays it was merely an ornament to the garden. 

A plant pot full of scarlet geraniums rested on its head, and an arbutula twined up the sides. 

Peachy climbed up the bank behind, and with the help of Jess removed the pot of scarlet 

geraniums; then very cautiously and carefully she let herself months, till we reached the mouth of 

the river. We sailed more than fifteen hundred leagues. God knows how we got through that great 

mass of water. I advise thee, O great King, never to send Spanish fleets into that accursed river. 

God preserve thee in his holy keeping."  This letter was given by Aguirre to the vicar of the island 

of Margareta, Pedro de Contreras, in order to be transmitted to King Philip II. Fray Pedro Simon, 

Provincial of
