cars made Tom drowsy. Almost before he knew it he was asleep.  What suddenly awakened him 

he could not tell. Perhaps it was some influence on the brain cells, as when a vivid dream causes 

us to start up from slumber, or it may have been a voice. For certainly Tom heard a voice, he 

declared afterward.  As he roused up he found himself staring at the rocky wall of the tunnel. And 

yet the wall seemed to have an opening in it and in the opening, as if it were in the frame of a 

picture, appeared the face Tom had seen at his library the day Job Titus called on him--the face of 

Waddington!  Tom sat up so quickly that he hit his head sharply on a projecting rock spur, and, for 

the moment he "saw stars." And with the appearance of these twinkling points of light the face of 

Waddington seemed to fade away, as might a vision in a dream.  "Bless my salt mackerel, as Mr. 

Damon would say!" cried Tom. "What have I discovered?"  He rubbed his head where he had 

struck it, and then passed his hand before his eyes, to make sure he was awake. But the vision, if 

vision it was, had vanished, and he saw only the bare rock wall. However, the echo of the voice 

remained in his ears, and, looking down toward the tunnel floor Tom saw Serato, the Indian 

foreman.  "Were you speaking to me?" asked Tom, for the man understood and spoke English 

fairly settlement grew up, which settlement has in our day expanded at length into the great and 

flourishing city of Winnipeg.  {168}  Nothing could daunt Verendrye and his sons, neither heat nor 

cold, hunger nor thirst.  They pressed on through the forest and over the prairie, exploring and 

building trading posts.  The news of their travels and successes with the Indians reached Quebec 

and Montreal, and a horde of hardy bush-rangers were soon following their example. The forts in 

the far wilderness grew closely packed with costly furs. Heavily-laden canoes by the hundred 

found their way by river and lake and toilsome portage to the great stone warehouses of Montreal, 

some of which are yet upstanding in the city.  It was after the leader Verendrye's death that one of 

his sons, on New Year's Day 1743, first amongst French Canadians, beheld the lofty snow-clad 

pinnacles of the Rocky Mountains.  Truly, in spite of many discouragements, the fleur-de-lys was 

being borne westward valiantly.     {169}  CHAPTER XI  HOW LOUISBURG SURRENDERED 

AND WAS GIVEN BACK  Twenty-seven years of peace!  It was a long respite, but long as it was, 

French and English were ready to fly at each other's throats with renewed vigour when war broke 

out again.  Quickly did the flames of the conflict spread to the New World.  Looking out from the 

ramparts of

"No, sar. I not know you there!" and the foreman seemed startled at seeing Tom. Clearly he was in 

a fright.  "You were speaking!" insisted Tom.  "No, sar!" The man shook his head.  "To some one 

up there!" went on the young inventor, waving his hand toward the spot where he had seen the 

face in the rock.  "Me speak to roof? No, sar!" Serato laughed.  Tom did not know what to believe. 

"You hear me tell um lazy man to much hurry," the Indian went on. "Me not know you sleep there, 

sar!"  "Oh, all right," Tom said, recollecting that he must keep up his disguise. seemed to the 

Governor that the moment was a most favourable one to recapture Nova Scotia for France.  The 

iron was struck while it was hot.  One thousand men, led by Duvivier, were despatched to 

Annapolis, which, under the name of Port Royal, has been the scene of so many vicissitudes.  On 

the way thither the French easily took Canso, at the entrance of the strait of that name, and sent 

its garrison prisoners to Louisburg.  Flushed with this victory, Duvivier marched by land to 

Annapolis, held for the English by Paul Mascarene.  But if the French thought they

"Yes, sar," and the foreman hurried on, with a backward glance over his shoulder.  "Now was I 

dreaming or not?" thought Tom. "I'm going to have a look at that place though, where I saw 

Waddington's face. Or did I imagine it?"  He got a long pole and a powerful flash lamp, and when 

he had a chance, unobserved, he poked around in the vicinity where he had seen the face.  But 

there was only solid rock.  "It must have been a dream," Tom concluded. "I've been thinking too 

much about this business. I'll have to give up.  I mistaken.  Of Huguenot extraction, Mascarene 

was yet a brave and sturdy Englishman.  "We are expecting," wrote Duvivier, "the arrival of three 

ships of war, carrying respectively {170} seventy, sixty, and forty guns, and a regiment of soldiers. 

Not that we need these, for I have already sufficient forces to storm your fort."  "Really," ran 

Mascarene's reply, "it will be time to consider the question of surrender when your French fleet is 

in the harbour."  Then it was Duvivier sent his brother proposing a truce and asking

mystery of the missing men."  The next day, much disappointed, he resumed his own character as 

explosive expert, and prepared for another blast. The net result of his watch was that he became 

suspicious of Serato, and so informed the Titus Brothers.  "Oh, but you're mistaken," said Job. 

"We have had him for years, on conditional capitulation of the garrison.  The brave Mascarene 

called his officers together and found that they were not disinclined to accept the French terms. 

"We have no chance," they said; "we are abandoned and our men losing heart; let us capitulate 

while we can."  They spoke so strongly, that Mascarene allowed
