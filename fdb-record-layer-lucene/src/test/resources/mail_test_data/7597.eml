philodendron monstera  Congress met on the 5th of December for the closing =
session of the Administration. The note of victory pervaded the President's=

Meanwhile the country came to the election of 1836. From the time of Van Bu=
ren's withdrawal=20

from the Cabinet in 1831 to become, with Jackson's full approval, a candida=
te for the vice=20

presidency, there never was doubt that the New Yorker would be the Democrat=
ic presidential=20

nominee in 1836, or that his election would mean a continuation, in most re=
spects, of the=20

Jacksonian rgime. Never did a President more clearly pick his successor. Th=
ere was, of course,=20

some protest within the party. Van Buren was not popular, and it required a=
ll of the personal and=20

official influence that the President could bring to lilies, according to S=
cripture, are gloriously=20

arrayed, though they cannot spin: _ergo_, the kingdom of the lily should ne=
ver pass to the distaff.=20

There were of course arguments of more weight than this, which we have vent=
ured to present=20

merely for the sake of its quaintness, characteristic as it is of the day w=
hen tireless pedants were=20

wont to debate in this fashion all things in heaven and on earth. Closer st=
udy of the Salic law itself,=20

nevertheless, was not reassuring to the adherents of France; for there they=
 found one of the=20

formulas of Marculf proving that, from the days of the Merovingian kings, t=
he=20

The anti-Administration forces entered the campaign with no flattering pros=
pects. Since 1832 their=20

opposition to "executive usurpation" had won for them a new party name, "Wh=
ig." But neither their=20

opposition nor any other circumstance had given them party solidarity. sali=
que_, the allodial land,=20

could be inherited by a woman. This ancient act reads: "To my dear daughter=
: It is among us a=20

custom ancient but impious that sisters shall not share with their brothers=
 in the heritage of the=20

paternal land. I have considered that you all came=20

Jackson predicted in 1834 that his opponents would nominate William Henry H=
arrison, because=20

"they have got to take up a soldier; they have tried orators enough." The p=
rophecy was a shrewd=20

one, and in 1840 it was fulfilled to the letter. Upon the present occasion,=
 however, the leaders=20

decided to place no single nominee in the field, but rather to from God, th=
at you should therefore=20

find an equal share of love in me, and, after my death, enjoy equally the h=
eritage of my worldly=20

goods. For these reasons, my sweet daughter, I constitute you by this lette=
r a legitimate and equal=20

co-heir with your brothers in all my estate, in such sort that you shall sh=

The plan was ingenious, but it did not work. Van Buren received 170 elector=
al votes against 124 in=20

spite of his opponents. He carried fifteen of the twenty-six States, includ=
ing four in New England.=20

Harrison received 73 votes, White 26 (including those of Tennessee), and We=
bster 14. South=20

Carolina refused to support any of the candidates on either side and threw =
away her votes on=20

W.P. Mangum of North Carolina. The Democrats kept control of both branches =
of Congress.=20

Victory, therefore, rested with the Jacksonians--which means with Jackson h=
imself. The=20

Democrats would have control of both the executive and legislative branches=
 of the Government=20

for some years to come; the Bank would not soon be re-chartered; the veto p=
ower would remain=20

intact; federal expenditure upon internal but the allodial land." In the ab=
stract, therefore, as much=20

could be said for as against the claims of a woman to succeed to the crown =
of France. There could=20

be no question, however, that the long established custom of the kingdom ha=
d excluded women,=20

and that this exclusion had operated to the great profit of the kingdom, by=
 keeping it under the=20

stronger rule of men, and more still by preventing it from passing under th=
e control of foreign=20

princes who had married French princesses. As a French constitutional lawye=
r has remarked:=20

"France is the only one of the great states of Europe where we see the crow=
n remaining for more=20

than eight centuries in the same family.... It is to the Salic Law that Fra=
nce owes the long=20

persistence of the Capetian dynasty."  In the first half of the fourteenth=
