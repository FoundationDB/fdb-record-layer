disguising a fool. In Italy, on the contrary, all the world is continually =
occupied in masquerading in=20

some way or other. Costume balls, in all classes of society, are favourite =
entertainments. Historical=20

masques, though not got up with the elaborate attention to minute detail wh=
ich is bestowed upon=20

them by the thoughtful beer-drinking and sausage-devouring German, are yet =
of very frequent=20

occurrence. Every city, every town, nay every hamlet, in Italy, has its lon=
g and glorious history,=20

often written in letters of blood, always deeply engraven on the hearts of =
the people. The=20

mementoes of a bygone time are cherished by the Italians. Consequently, dre=
ssing up in Italy is=20

universal, and even the man who dines upon a penny roll and a quarter of a =
melon, can afford five=20

centessimi, or one halfpenny, for a paper nose, and it costs him nothing to=
 flour his there were so=20

many dishes, and apparently all of the highest pretension. But if his simpl=
e tastes had permitted=20

him to take an interest in these details, which, they did not, he would hav=
e been assisted by a=20

gorgeous menu of gold and white typography, that was by the side of each gu=
est. The table=20

seemed literally to groan under vases and gigantic flagons, and, in its mid=
st, rose a mountain of=20

silver, on which apparently all the cardinal virtues, several of the pagan =
deities, and Britannia=20

herself, illustrated with many lights a glowing inscription, which describe=
d the fervent feelings of a=20

grateful client.  There were many guests=E2=80=94the Dowager of Farringford=
, a lady of quality,=20

Apollonia=E2=80=99s great lady, who exercised under this roof much social t=
yranny; in short, was rather fine;=20

but who, on this occasion, was somewhat cowed by the undreamt-of presence o=

Let us take an instance. Ivrea is a little place, a small garrison town, ce=
lebrated for its coolness=20

and its cheapness; thither the Piedmontese flock in crowds when the heat of=
 the city is no longer=20

bearable. There is nothing remarkable about the place; it has its opera hou=
se, at which ambitious=20

young ladies, principally English and Americans, pupils of the Conservatori=
o at Milan, make their=20

_debuts_. Happy garrison, happy sojourners in the little Italian town; they=
 are provided with a=20

succession of interesting, though perhaps undeveloped, prima donnas, who ma=
ke their little=20

successes or their tiny fiascoes at this nursery of Art. But Ivrea, like al=
l the other Italian towns, has=20

its history, its glorious legend, which is never allowed to die, and the Ca=
rnival of Ivrea is the time=20

chosen for representing the story and commemorating the tragic history of t=
he local heroine. In the=20

Middle Ages, Ivrea had its feudal lord. The Count Arduino, as may be fancie=
d from his name, was=20

a bold, bad man; he possessed the terrible _Droit de Seigneur_, which he ri=
gorously exacted. The=20

belle of the village was a miller's daughter:      "We never see such maide=
ns now,     Such mill-

wheels turn not round."  She was married. No sooner was the ceremony over t=
han the wicked=20

count ordered her to present herself at the castle. The command of the feud=
al lord could not be=20

disobeyed. Bride and bridegroom, accompanied by the weeping crowd, proceede=
d to the castle=20

gate. Count Arduino advanced to meet her with a smile, unarmed and unattend=
ed. He was but=20

claiming his rights. As he stepped forward to salute her, she presented her=
 cheek to him, and=20

suddenly stabbed him dead at her feet. The mob of relatives and friends wre=
cked and burned the=20

castle, massacring the retainers to a man. The brave young bride was safely=
 escorted home,=20

where the wedding feast was triumphantly celebrated, and the miller's daugh=
ter lived to be the=20

happy mother of many children, and died at a good old age. From that day th=
e _Droit de=20

Seigneur_ ceased to exist in Ivrea.  This is the origin of the yearly cerem=
ony at the little Italian=20

town. A pretty boy of seven or eight years of age is chosen by each parish.=
 The boys are dressed=20

in fancy costumes and mounted on horses, escorted by the general of the Car=
nival, who wears a=20

black uniform, and accompanied by his officers, who are clothed in scarlet.=
 During the Carnival the=20

town is under the rule of the general and his officers. The party are recei=
ved in state by the mayor,=20

the bishop, and the personages of Ivrea. A poetical address is given at eac=
h notable's house. On=20

the second day, the children, some eight or ten in number (they are called =
_Abba_), on horseback,=20

and escorted by the general and his officers, head a procession, which pass=
es through the town,=20

and which is joined by all the carriages of the place, filled with ladies i=
n gala costume and men in=20

fancy dresses. Everybody dresses up. Then are thrown from windows and balco=
nies, oranges,=20

flowers, and real _confetti_, not the chalk _coriandoli_ of Milan, but good=
 eatable sugar-plums. In=20

the evening the little theatre is illuminated regardless met him, and proba=
bly never would have met=20

him, had she not had the good fortune of dining at his lawyer=E2=80=99s. Ho=
wever, Lady Farringford was=20

placed a long way from Lothair, having been taken down to dinner by Mr. Gil=
es; and so, by the end=20

of the first course, Lady Farringford had nearly resumed her customary desp=
otic vein, and was=20

beginning to indulge in several kind observations, cheapening to her host a=
nd hostess, and=20

indirectly exalting herself; upon which Mr. Giles took an early easy opport=
unity of apprising Lady=20

Farringford, that she had nearly met Cardinal Grandison at dinner, and that=
 his eminence would=20

certainly pay his respects to Mrs. Putney Giles in the evening. As Lady Far=
ringford was at present=20

a high ritualist and had even been talked of as =E2=80=9Cgoing to Rome,=E2=
=80=9D this intelligence was stunning, and=20

it was observed that her ladyship was unusually subdued during the whole of=
 the second course.=20



On the right of Lothair sat the wife of a vice-chancellor, a quiet and plea=
sing lady, to whom Lothair,=20

with natural good breeding, paid snatches of happy attention, when he could=
 for a moment with=20

propriety withdraw himself from the blaze of Apollonia=E2=80=99s coruscatin=
g conversation. Then there was=20

a rather fierce-looking Red Ribbon, medalled, as well as be-starred, and th=
e Red Ribbon=E2=80=99s wife,=20

with a blushing daughter, in spite of her parentage not yet accustomed to s=
tand fire. A partner and=20

his unusually numerous family had the pleasure also of seeing Lothair for t=
he first time, and there=20

were no less than four M.P.s, one of whom was even in office.  Apollonia wa=
s stating to Lothair,=20

with perspicuity, the reasons which quite induced her to believe that the G=
ulf-Stream had changed=20

its course, and the political and social consequences that might accrue.  =
=E2=80=9CThe religious sentiment=20

of the Southern races must be wonderfully affected by a more rigorous clima=
te,=E2=80=9D said Apollonia. =E2=80=9CI=20

cannot doubt,=E2=80=9D she continued, =E2=80=9Cthat a series of severe wint=
ers at Rome might put an end to=20

Romanism.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut is there any fear that a reciprocal influe=
nce might be exercised on the Northern=20

nations?=E2=80=9D inquired Lothair. =E2=80=9CWould there be any apprehensio=
n of our Protestantism becoming=20

proportionately relaxed?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COf course not,=E2=80=9D said Ap=
ollonia. =E2=80=9CTruth cannot be affected by climate.=20

Truth is truth, alike in Palestine and Scandinavia.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI wo=
nder what the cardinal would think of this,=E2=80=9D=20

said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cwho, you tell me, is coming to you this evening?=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, I am most interested to see=20

him, though he is the most puissant of our foes. Of course he would take re=
fuge in sophistry; and=20

science, you know, they deny.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCardinal Grandison is givi=
ng some lectures on science,=E2=80=9D said the=20

vice-chancellor=E2=80=99s lady, quietly.  =E2=80=9CIt is remorse,=E2=80=9D =
said Apollonia. =E2=80=9CTheir clever men can never forget=20

that unfortunate affair of Galileo, and think they can divert the indignati=
on of the ninteenth century=20

by mock zeal about red sandstone or the origin of species.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CAnd are you afraid of the Gulf-

Stream?=E2=80=9D inquired Lothair of his calmer neighbor.  =E2=80=9CI think=
 we want more evidence of a change.=20

The vice-chancellor and myself went down to a place we have near town, on=
=20


_
being expended on extra lamps. Between the acts the Carnival hymn is sung b=
y the whole=20

strength of the company, the _Abba_ children, the general and his officers,=
 who appear upon the=20

stage; and it is a _sine qua non_ that every one should wear the republican=
 red cap, even the=20

_Abba_ is a very nice piece of water; indeed, some people call it a lake; b=
ut it was quite frozen,=20

and my boys wanted to skate, but that I would not permit.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CYou believe in the Gulf-Stream to that=20

extent,=E2=80=9D said Lothair=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Cno skating.=E2=80=9D  The ca=
rdinal came, early; the ladies had not long left the=20


_
audience, male and female, also sport the red cap of liberty. Secreted in t=
he omnibus box has=20

been seated the prettiest girl in the town. The _Mugnaia_, as she is called=
, is carefully arrayed in=20

the costume of the bygone time when the tragedy took place, and now she is =
escorted by the=20

general of the Carnival to the footlights, a drum and fife band preceding h=
er, the Carnival hymn is=20

sung, vociferously encored and joined in by the audience. The _Mugnaia_ now=
 returns to the box=20

in which she sits in royal state, the observed of all observers. Of course,=
 she is got up regardless=20

of expense. She, too, wears the little red cap, and, as has been said, has =
been chosen for her=20

good looks. The opera is concluded, a masked ball follows.  Next day, at se=
ven a.m., in every=20

parish the bride who was last married proceeds in procession to the Piazza =
of that parish, and with=20

a mallet she indicates the place for the annual _scarlo_, or bonfire. She i=
s accompanied by her=20

husband. The object of these _scarli_ is to manifest the popular exultation=
 at the annihilation of=20

feudal tyranny. The pair now return home, preceded by a drum and fife band,=
 and escorted by an=20

enthusiastic crowd singing songs of liberty at the full pitch of their voic=
es.  At two o'clock, the=20

general of the They were agitated when his name was announced; even Apollon=
ia=E2=80=99s heart beat;=20

but then that might be accounted for by the inopportune recollection of an =
occasional=20

correspondence with Caprera.  Nothing could exceed the simple suavity with =
which the cardinal=20

appeared, approached, and greeted them. He thanked Apollonia for her permis=
sion to pay his=20

respects to her, which he had long wished to do; and then they were all pre=
sented, and he said=20

exactly the right thing to every one. He must have heard of them all before=
, or read their=20

characters in their countenances. In a few minutes they were all listening =
to his eminence with=20

enchanted ease, as, sitting on the sofa by his hostess, he described to the=
m the ambassadors=20

who had just arrived from Japan, and with whom he had relations of interest=
ing affairs. The=20

Japanese government had exhibited enlightened kindness to some of his poor =
people who had=20

barely escaped martyrdom. Much might be expected from the Mikado, evidently=
 a man of singular=20

penetration and elevated views; and his eminence looked as if the mission o=
f Yokohama would=20

speedily end in an episcopal see; but he knew where he was and studiously a=
voided all=20

controversial matter.  After all, the Mikado himself was not more remarkabl=
e than this prince of the=20


_
the _Mugnaia_. This is held in the Piazza Carlo Alberto, which is the large=
st square in the town.=20

The orchestra is placed in the centre of the square. Then there is a proces=
sion headed by the=20

_Mugnaia_, seated on a scarlet velvet throne, and borne in a gilded car; th=
en comes a military=20

band, then the carriages filled with shouting masqueraders and ladies in el=
aborate toilettes;=20

flowers, sweets, and oranges, are thrown with amazing and cape, and waving,=
 as he spoke, with=20

careless grace, his pink barrette.  The ladies thought the gentlemen rejoin=
ed them too soon, but=20

Mr. Giles, when he was apprised of the arrival of the cardinal, thought it =
right to precipitate the=20

symposium. With great tact, when the cardinal rose to greet him, Mr. Giles =
withdrew his eminence=20

from those surrounding, and, after a brief interchange of whispered words, =
quitted him and then=20
