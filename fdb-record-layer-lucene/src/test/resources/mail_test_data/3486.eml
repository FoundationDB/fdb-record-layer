for good in poor communities--that it can not only give them a pure instead=

can raise them socially and intellectually. The effects of a simple form of=
 Islam on these African=20

converts may give one some notion of its influence on its hearers in the ea=
rly days, before the=20

theologians had corrupted it.  But this good influence is very partial and =
limited, even among the=20

poorer classes. In communities where all are poor, Islam is an excellent ag=
ent for improvement;=20

but in countries where there are many grades of wealth and rank, the poor o=
nly ape in a humble=20

manner the vices of those whom they are taught to regard as their 'betters.=
' In all civilised and=20

wealthy countries the social system of Islam exerts a ruinous influence on =
all classes, and if there=20

is to be any great future for the Mohammadan world, that system of society =
must be done away.=20

White Tail, knowing that he was expected to assume control, trotted up to t=

noticed that, as he passed Father Buck, he was taller and stronger in limb =
than the ex-leader. The=20

tips of his antlers towered a full foot higher than those of Father Buck. E=

this, and were satisfied that he would prove a good leader.  =E2=80=9CFathe=

 I show lack of=20

wisdom and justice, may Loup the Lynx or Sneaky trip me, and devour me. I s=
