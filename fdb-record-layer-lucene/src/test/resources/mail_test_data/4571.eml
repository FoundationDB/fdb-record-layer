more quietly:  "I will accept a further six thousand francs from you, citizen Martin-Roget, in the 

name of the Republic and all her needs. The Republic of France is up in arms against the entire 

world. She hath need of men, of arms, of...."  "Oh! cut that," interposed young Lalouet roughly. 

But the over-vain, high and mighty despot who was ready to lash out with unbridled fury against 

the slightest show of disrespect on the part of any other man, only laughed at the boy's 

impudence.  "Curse you, you young viper," he said with that rude familiarity which he seemed to 

reserve for the boy, "you presume too much on my forbearance. These children you know, 

citizen.... Name of a dog!" he added roughly, "we are wasting time! What was I saying ...?"  "That 

you would take six thousand francs," replied Martin-Roget curtly, "in return for further help in the 

matter of the Kernogans."  "Why, yes!" rejoined Carrier blandly, "I was forgetting. But I'll show you 

what a good dog I am. I'll help you with those Kernogans ... but you mistook my words, citizen: 'tis 

ten thousand francs you must pour into the coffers of the Republic, for her servants will have to be 

placed at the disposal of your private schemes of vengeance."  "Ten thousand francs is a large 

sum," said Martin-Roget. "Let me hear what you will do for me for that."  He had regained 

something of his former complacency. The man who buys--be it goods, consciences or services--

is always for the moment master of the man who sells. Carrier, despite his dictatorial ways, felt this 

disadvantage, no doubt, for his tone was more bland, his manner less curt. Only young Jacques 

Lalouet stood by--like a snarling terrier--still been born and bred among the solemnities of the 

wilderness, and had been up to that time wholly unacquainted with the humours and pleasantries 

that sometimes accompany juvenile "cheek," our wonder may perhaps be subdued.  "This would 

be a splendid place to camp for the rest of the day," suggested Davidson, while they rested on 

their paddles after the goose had been secured.  "We must lay in a small stock of fresh provisions, 

you know, if we are to push on to-morrow or next day to our hunting ground.  What say you, 

Okematan?" he added in Cree, turning to their guide.  "The will of the Paleface chief is the wish of 

Okematan.  Let him speak."  "Well, then, I vote for encamping on the small island over there, in 

the middle o' the lake--for it's far more like a lake than a river hereabouts--that one over which the 

hawk is hovering."  "I vote for it too," said Archie.  "So do I," chimed in Little Bill.  "I will be sayin' 

ditto to that," put in Fergus.  "Moreover," suggested Dan, "I vote for roasting the goose at once." 

"Ay, and eating him right away," said Archie.  As the invalid followed this up with a feeble cheer, 

the proposal was carried into effect without delay.  The islet was low and flat, and so thickly 

covered with bush that it afforded a most enticing spot for a night-encampment.  There was also 

plenty of dead wood on it, with which to replenish the fire, and various peeps through sundry 

openings afforded exquisite views of woodland and river with which to charm the eyes.  Over all, 

the sun was pouring his noontide rays in a glorious flood.  We need not waste time in going into 

the details of the feast that followed: how the goose was delightfully plump and

situation--seeing that neither schemes of vengeance nor those of corruption had ruffled his self-

assurance. He remained beside the door, ready to pounce on either of the two intruders if they 

showed the slightest sign of forgetting the majesty of the great proconsul.   VI  "I told you just now, 

citizen Martin-Roget," resumed Carrier after a brief pause, "and I suppose you knew it already, 

that I am surrounded with spies."  "Spies, citizen?" murmured Martin-Roget, somewhat taken 

aback by this sudden irrelevance. "I didn't know ... I imagine.... Any one in your position...."  "That's 

just it," broke in Carrier roughly. "My position is envied by those who are less competent, less 

patriotic than I am. Nantes is swarming with spies. Mine enemies in Paris are working against me. 

They want to undermine the confidence which the National Convention reposes in her accredited 

representative."  tender to teeth that would have scarcely observed the difference if it had been 

tough--how, in addition to the goose, they had wild-ducks enough--shot earlier in the day--to afford 

each one a duck to himself, leaving a brace over, of which Okematan ate one, as well as his share 

of the goose, and seemed to wish that he might eat the other, but he didn't, for he restrained 

himself; how they drank tea with as much gusto and intemperance as if it had been a modern 

"afternoon"; and how, after all was over, the Red-man filled the pipe-head on the back of his iron 

tomahawk and began to smoke with the air of a man who meant business and regarded all that 

had gone before as mere child's-play.  The afternoon was well advanced when the feast was 

concluded, for appetites in the wilderness are not easily or soon satisfied.  "I feel tight," said Billie 

with a sigh and something of pathos in his tone, when he 


_
"Well!" rejoined Carrier with a savage oath, "you would have thought that the Convention would be 

only too thankful to get a strong man at the head of affairs in this hotbed of treason and of 

rebellion. You would have thought that it was no one's affair to interfere with the manner in which I 

administer the powers that have been given me. I command in Nantes, what? Yet some 

busybodies up in Paris, some fools, seem to think that we are going too fast in Nantes. They have 

become weaklings over there since Marat has gone. It seems that they have heard rumours of our 

flat-bottomed barges and of our fine Republican marriages: apparently they disapprove of both. 

They don't realise that we have to purge an entire city of every kind of rabble--traitors as well as 

criminals. They don't understand my aspirations, my ideals," he added loftily and with a wide, 

sweeping gesture of his arm, "which is to make Nantes a model city, to free her from the taint of 

crime and of treachery, and...."  An impatient exclamation from young Lalouet once again broke in 

on Carrier's rhetoric, and Martin-Roget was able to slip in the query which had been hovering on 

his lips:  "And is this relevant, citizen Carrier," he asked, "to the subject which we have been 

discussing?"  "It is," replied Carrier drily, "as you will see in a moment. Learn then, that it has been 

my purpose for some time to silence mine enemies by sending to the National Convention a 

scorned such implements at that time.  "That's right, Little Bill," said Archie, "try another leg or 

wing--now, don't shake your head.  We've come on this trip a-purpose to make you fat an' strong. 

So you must--here, try this drum-stick.  It's only a little one, like yourself, Billie."  "True, Archie, but 

I'm too little to hold it.  I feel like an egg now."  "Hallo!  Oke, are you overcome already?" asked 

Archie.  "The sun sinks to rest at night and the birds go to sleep.  If we intend to hunt we must 

begin now."  "It's always the way," returned the boy with an air of discontent; "whenever a fellow 

gets into a state of extreme jollity there's sure to be something bothersome to come and interrupt 

us.  Obfusticate your faculties with some more smoke, Oke, till Billie and I finish our tea. We can't 

shoot with half-empty stomachs, you know."  "They must be three-quarters full by this time--

whatever," remarked Fergus, wiping his clasp-knife on the grass.  Just then, Dan Davidson, who 

had gone to explore the islet, returned with the information that some hunters must have recently 

visited the same place, for he had discovered the remains of an encampment at the extreme 

eastern side, which looked as if it had been recently occupied, for bones of wild-fowl were 

scattered about, the meat on which was neither dried nor decayed.  On hearing this, Okematan 

rose quickly, put out his pipe, and stuck the tomahawk in his belt.  The

accusations which have been levelled against me. It is my purpose to explain to the Assembly my 

reasons for mine actions in Nantes, my Drownages, my Republican marriages, all the coercive 

measures which I have been forced to take in order to purge the city from all that is undesirable." 

"And think which he had been smoking vanished; the half-sleepy eyes opened, and a frown rested 

on his brow as he said, shortly--  "Okematan goes to look."  "May I go with you?" asked Dan.  "No. 

Okematan goes alone.  It is known that a band of Saulteaux have been seen.  They are roused 

just now by the actions of
