dracaena marginata journey to me. With his forepaws, his claws digging the snow, he began to drag himself toward me.  I could only wait.

He knew that it was an dracaena marginata journey to me. With his forepaws, his claws digging the snow, he began to drag himself toward me.  I could only wait.

He knew that it was an _
moose, walked for a full hour, seeing nothing living but the woodpeckers and the chickadees, 

hearing nothing but the rustle of the branches, as released of their loads they sprang back into 

place. Then, quite needlessly, I found insecure footing under the snow, and plunged suddenly at 

full length. My rifle whirled from my hand with force, and I heard it strike against the uncovered top 

of a sugar-loaf stone. I jumped up in fear and hastily examined it. The breech was shattered--my 

rifle was as useless as any stick.  Now I thought of the catamount, as, with the broken rifle in my 

hands, I looked about me in the woods, bright with sun and snow. I was not entirely helpless, for 

my revolver and knife were in my belt.  Yet a thirty-eight calibre revolver, even with a long 

cartridge and a long barrel, is not a sure defence against an animal as heavy as myself, which in 

facing me would present for a mark only a round head and a chest with muscles so thick and 

knotty that they would probably stop any revolver bullet. I doubted my ability to hit the eye.  Very 

likely I was no longer followed; and in any case, I might call Alaric. And yet he was too far away for 

a shout to reach him, and I dared not fire signal-shots, for in order to travel light, I had left at camp 

all revolver cartridges but those in the chambers.  So I started at once for the bottom of the valley, 

hoping to strike Alaric's trail on the opposite slope, and intending to follow it until I caught him.  My 

rifle I left where it was; it was useless and heavy. I cast many a glance behind me as, almost at a 

trot, I made my way down the long hillside.  I strode on rapidly, for I had certainly a mile to cover 

before I could strike Alaric's trail, much more before I could catch my nimble guide. and tender of 

all ages--for a male. I mean the age of fifty. An age absurdly misunderstood by all those who have 

not reached it! A thrilling age! Appearances are tragically deceptive.  The inhabitant of the puce 

dressing-gown had a short greying beard and moustache; his plenteous hair was passing from 

pepper into salt; there were many minute wrinkles in the hollows between his eyes and the fresh 

crimson of his cheeks; and the eyes were sad; they were very sad. Had he stood erect and looked 

perpendicularly down, he would have perceived, not his slippers, but a protuberant button of the 

dressing-gown. Understand me: I conceal nothing; I admit the figures written in the measurement-

book of his tailor. He was fifty. Yet, like most men of fifty, he was still very young, and, like most 

bachelors of fifty, he was rather helpless. He was quite sure that he had not had the best of luck. If 

he had excavated his soul he would have discovered somewhere in its deeps a wistful, appealing 

desire to be taken care of, to be sheltered from the inconveniences and harshness of the world. 

But he would not have admitted the discovery. A bachelor of fifty cannot be expected to admit that 

he resembles a girl of nineteen. Nevertheless it is a strange fact that the resemblance between the 

heart of an experienced, adventurous bachelor of fifty and the simple heart of a girl of nineteen is 

stronger than girls of nineteen imagine; especially when the bachelor of fifty is sitting solitary and 

unfriended at two o'clock in the night, in the forlorn atmosphere of a house that has outlived its 

hopes. Bachelors of fifty alone will comprehend me.  It has never been decided what young girls 

do meditate upon when they meditate; young girls themselves cannot decide. As a rule the 


_
behind, I saw, a hundred yards away, a tawny animal quickly slip behind a tree.  I hastily drew my 

revolver and knife; but no movement came from its hidden breast, and rather than stand and wait, 

I pursued my retreat. I moved more slowly, yet as fast as I could and still guard myself against 

another fall and watch for a rush from behind. I scanned the ground in front of me, and glanced 

back every second. For some time I saw no more of the catamount.  But when I did see him, I was 

startled at his nearness; he was within fifty yards. I hurried on as he slipped aside again; but 

looking again in a moment, I saw him now following boldly upon my trail. I stopped, but he 

stopped, too, and stood regarding me. He was too far away for me to fire yet, and as he made no 

movement to approach, I cautiously continued my retreat, always after a few steps stopping to 

face him.  He stopped as I stopped, yet each time I turned away he came quickly closer. I was 

already thinking of awaiting him without further movement, when the way was blocked by a ravine. 

It was cut by the stream that drained the valley, and its steep sides were nearly fifteen feet in 

height. They even overhung in places, but this I did not then know. I was in no mind to trust myself 

in the deep gully, where the catamount might drop upon me before I could scramble out upon the 

other side.  I walked into an open space, and took my stand close to a birch that grew on the very 

edge of the bank. For thirty feet there was no good cover for the catamount; so, armed and 

determined, I waited his action.  The animal skirted the bushes about me, as if examining the 

ground, and to my disappointment, began to come upon me along the edge of the ravine. This 

gave him the best cover before his charge, and at the same time assured him that the momentum 

of his rush would not carry him tumbling into the gully. Always keeping too well concealed for a 

good mark, he crept up behind a fallen tree, on the near side of which a little bush grew, and 

flattened himself there, watching me, I felt sure, and waiting, in the hope that he might catch me off 

my guard.  I cannot describe how stealthy and noiseless and altogether perfect his maneuvering 

was. Although the trees that grew about were all small and the bushes bare, and although the 

white snow gave no background for concealment, he covered himself so perfectly at one time, and 

slipped in and out of sight so quickly at another, that although I stood with revolver pointed and 

cocked, I could find no opportunity for a shot.  As he circled for position he came ever nearer, and 

I could see at one time the round head, with its short, pointed ears; at another the long, sinuous, 

muscular body; but they moved so rapidly that before I could shoot they were gone from sight.  All 

the time he made no sound but a little rustle. In his final concealment I saw nothing of him but his 

tail, that twitched and twitched and twitched.  At last I caught the glint of his pale green eye and 

fired. There came a snarl from behind the bush, and it was dashed to one side and the other, while 

round head and bared teeth and tawny body came crashing through. I pulled trigger again, and the 

report sounded muffled, and the smoke for an instant obscured the beast. All was white, when, like 

a breath, it passed, and I saw the rushing catamount not ten feet from me.  I had not time to fire or 

crouch, but with ready legs hurled myself to one side, and threw my left arm around the tree that 

grew at the edge of the bank. With an awful dread I felt the ground giving way beneath me.  I 

dropped my knife and caught the tree closer, when it, too, leaned to fall. It hung for a moment over 

the steep slope, and I could not save myself. The frost had not clamped the over-hang to the solid 

ground. The last fall rains had cut it under; the first spring thaw would have brought it down, had 

not my weight been thrown upon it.  With a twist the tree and I fell together. I clutched my revolver 

desperately, despite the sickening fear of the fall, and in my grasp it exploded in mid air. Then I 



fell, and although my body struck easily in the snow-covered ravine, my right hand had been 

beaten against a sharp rock, and the birch was upon me so that I could not move.  My legs were 

on the bank, and underneath the snow beneath my shoulders I soon felt the ice, from which 

stones protruded. One snow-covered rock received and supported my head. I lay upon my right 

side, and my right hand, swinging in a curve, had struck with force upon another stone, and lay 

upon the ice, the only part of my body, except my head, which was free. My left arm was pressed 

close to my side by the birch, which lay across my body and legs.  The weight was not so great 

but that I could have lifted it, could I but have gained purchase. But I must at the same time lift my 

own body, for my hips were lower than my feet, my shoulders lower than my hips; and I could not 

gather ten pounds of force in that position.  My fall confused me somewhat, and I could not at first 

feel anything, either the pain in my hand or the danger I was in. I noticed only the fine, powdery 

snow which, cast up by the fall, settled upon me as I lay. Then I saw my arm, stretched out in front 

of me, with a bloody hand at the end of fancies of middle-aged bachelors are scarcely less 

amenable to definition. But the case of the inhabitant of the puce dressing-gown was an exception 

to the rule. He knew, and he could have said, precisely what he was thinking about. In that sad 

hour and place, his melancholy thoughts were centred upon the resplendent, unique success in 

life of a gifted and glorious being known to nations and newspapers as Priam Farll.   _Riches and 

Renown_   In the days when the New Gallery was new, a picture, signed by the unknown name of 

Priam Farll, was exhibited there, and aroused such terrific interest that for several months no 

conversation among cultured persons was regarded as complete without some reference to it. 

That the artist was a very great painter indeed was admitted by every one; the only question which 

cultured persons felt it their duty to settle was whether he was the greatest painter that ever lived 

or merely the greatest painter since Velasquez. Cultured persons might have continued to discuss 

that nice point to the present hour, had it not leaked out that the picture had been refused by the 

Royal Academy. The culture of London then at once healed up its strife and combined to fall on 

the Royal Academy as an institution which had no right to exist. The affair even got into Parliament 

and occupied three minutes of the imperial legislature. Useless for the Royal Academy to argue 

that it had overlooked the canvas, for its dimensions were seven feet by five; it represented a 

policeman, a simple policeman, life-size, and it was not merely the most striking portrait 

imaginable, but the first appearance of the policeman in great art; criminals, one heard, 

instinctively fled before it. No! The Royal Academy really could not argue that the work had been 

overlooked. And in truth the Royal Academy did not argue accidental negligence. It did not argue 

about its own right to exist. It did not argue at all. It blandly went on existing, and taking about a 

hundred and fifty pounds a day in shillings at its polished turnstiles. No details were obtainable 

concerning Priam Farll, whose address was Poste Restante, St. Martin's-le-Grand. Various 

collectors, animated by deep faith in their own judgment and a sincere desire to encourage British 

art, were anxious to purchase the picture for a few pounds, and these enthusiasts were astonished 

and pained to learn that Priam Farll had marked a figure of L1,000--the price of a rare postage 

stamp.  In consequence the picture was not sold; and after an enterprising journal had 

unsuccessfully offered a reward for the identification of the portrayed policeman, the matter went 

gently to sleep while the public employed its annual holiday as usual in discussing the big 

gooseberry of matrimonial relations.  Every one naturally expected that in the following year the 



mysterious Priam Farll would, in accordance with the universal rule for a successful career in 

British art, contribute another portrait of another policeman to the New Gallery--and so on for 

about twenty years, at the end of which period England would have learnt to recognize him as its 

favourite painter of policemen. But Priam Farll contributed nothing to the New Gallery. He had 

apparently forgotten the New Gallery: which was considered to be ungracious, if not ungrateful, on 

his part. Instead, he adorned the Paris salon with a large seascape showing penguins in the 

foreground. Now these penguins became the penguins of the continental year; they made 

penguins the fashionable bird in Paris, and also (twelve months later) in London. The French 

Government offered to buy the picture on behalf of the Republic at its customary price of five 

hundred francs, but Priam Farll sold it to the American connoisseur Whitney C. Whitt for five 

thousand dollars. Shortly afterwards he sold the policeman, whom he had kept by him, to the 

same connoisseur for ten thousand dollars. Whitney C. Whitt was the expert who had paid two 

hundred thousand dollars for a Madonna and St. Joseph, with donor, of Raphael. The enterprising 

journal before mentioned calculated that, counting the space actually occupied on the canvas by 

the policeman, the daring connoisseur had expended two guineas per square inch on the 

policeman.  At which stage the vast newspaper public suddenly woke up and demanded with one 

voice:  "Who is this Priam Farll?"  Though the query remained unanswered, Priam Farll's 

reputation was henceforward absolutely assured, and this in spite of the fact that he omitted to 

comply with the regulations ordained by English society for the conduct of successful painters. He 

ought, first, to have taken the elementary precaution of being born in the United States. He ought, 

after having refused all interviews for months, to have ultimately granted a special one to a 

newspaper with the largest circulation. He ought to have returned to England, grown a mane and a 

tufted tail, and become the king of beasts; or at least to have made a speech at a banquet about 

the noble and purifying mission of art. Assuredly he ought to have painted the portrait of his father 

or grandfather as an artisan, to prove that he was not a snob. But no! Not content with making 

each of his pictures utterly different from all the others, he neglected all the 


_
myself.  A pain shot from finger-tip to shoulder as I closed my hand tighter upon the butt of the 

revolver. But I clenched my teeth and tried to rise--tried twice more before I gave it up as 

hopeless. Then I raised my hand and put it in a better position, propped upon a stone.  The 

movements hurt me terribly, but I thought of the catamount, which would surely not be satisfied 

with two bullets for its breakfast. I was scarcely ready when the head of the beast was thrust over 

the edge of the bank to look for me.  He saw, and gloated as a human enemy might have done. 

His savage snarl was full of intelligence, and his slow approach was deliberate torture. He stood 

for a moment in full view--then slipped and slid down to the surface of the ice, where, ten yards 

away, he stood and looked at me.  I saw his magnificent build, his superb muscular development, 

as with his body in profile, his head some men of whom it may be said that, like a punter on a 

good day, they can't do wrong. Priam Farll was one such. In a few years he had become a legend, 

a standing side-dish of a riddle. No one knew him; no one saw him; no one married him. 

Constantly abroad, he was ever the subject of conflicting rumours. Parfitts themselves, his London 

agents, knew naught of him but his handwriting--on the backs of cheques in four figures. They sold 

an average of five large and five small pictures for him every year. These pictures arrived out of 

the unknown and the cheques went into the unknown.  Young artists, mute in admiration before 

the masterpieces from his brush which enriched all the national galleries of Europe (save, of 

course, that in Trafalgar Square), dreamt of him, worshipped him, and quarrelled fiercely about 

him, as the very symbol of glory, luxury and flawless accomplishment, never 


_
before approaching, playing with my helplessness; but I was not entirely helpless! With shaking 

hand I took aim; I could not use my thumb to cock the revolver, but drew hard at the trigger, and 

the hammer rose and fell.  My turn for gloating had come now, for the catamount was crying with 

rage and pain. He fell writhing, striking with his forepaws at the snow, and raising his head to snap 

at nothing; but this did not last long. Slowly he dragged himself to boots to lace up, a palette to 

clean, a beating heart, and an instinctive fear of solitude.  Finally there came to him the paramount 

distinction, the last proof that he was appreciated. The press actually fell into the habit of 

mentioning his name without explanatory comment. Exactly as it does not write "Mr. A.J. Balfour, 

the eminent statesman," or "Sarah Bernhardt, the renowned actress," or "Charles Peace, the 

historic murderer," but simply "Mr. A.J.

could understand his plight and estimate my own danger.  My first two bullets had but torn his 

flesh. My last had broken his back. He was paralyzed in his hind legs, as I have seen a deer, yet 

he had many minutes to live, perhaps hours, and was strong and angry enough to finish me. "Mr. 

Priam Farll." And no occupant of a smoker in a morning train ever took his pipe out of his mouth to 

ask, "What is the johnny?" Greater honour in England hath no man. Priam Farll was the first 

English painter to enjoy this supreme social reward.  And now he was inhabiting the puce
