her rush, she backed towards the dense jungle, throwing her trunk about and trumpeting with 

rage. Snatching the Ceylon No. 10 from one of my trusty Tokrooris (Hassan), I ran straight at her, 

took a most deliberate aim at the forehead, and once more fired. The only effect was a decisive 

charge; but before I Gregorics spits blood! Oh, you silly little Marys and Carolines. Of course Pal 

Gregorics is an ugly, sickly man, but think how rich he is; and after all, he only spits his own blood. 

So what can it matter to you?  Believe me, Rosalia, who is ten years older than you, would not be 

such a silly little goose,

barrel, Jali rushed in, and, with one blow of his sharp sword, severed the back sinew. She was 

utterly helpless in the same instant. Bravo, Jali! I had fired three beautifully correct shots with No. 

10 bullets, and seven drachms of powder in each charge; these were so nearly together that they 

occupied a space in her forehead of about three inches, and all had failed to kill! There could no 

longer be any doubt that the forehead shot at an African elephant could not be and if she were to 

be told that Pal Gregorics spits blood she would only think to herself, "What an interesting man!" 

And aloud she would say, "I will nurse him." And deep down in her mind where she keeps the 

ideas that cannot be put into words, which, in fact, are hardly even thoughts as yet, she would find 

these words, "If Gregorics spits blood already, he won't last so very long."  You silly little girls, you 

know nothing of life as yet; your mothers have put you

Indian species: this increased the danger tenfold, as in Ceylon I had generally made certain of an 

elephant by steadily waiting until it was close upon me.  I now reloaded my rifles, and the 

aggageers quitted the jungle to remount their horses, as they expected the herd had broken cover 

on the other side of the jungle; in which case they intended to give chase, and if possible, to turn 

them back into the covert, and drive them towards the guns. We accordingly took our stand in the 

small open proportion. Don't be angry with me for speaking so plainly, but it is my duty to show my 

readers why Pal Gregorics did not find a wife among you. The reason is a simple one. The open 

rose is not perfectly pure; bees have bathed in its chalice, insects have slept in it. But in the heart 

of an opening bud, not a speck of dust is to be found.  That is why Pal Gregorics was refused by 

so many young girls, and by degrees he began to see that they were right (for, as I said before, he 

was a good,
