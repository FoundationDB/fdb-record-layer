, Miss Rodgers=20

being mainly responsible for the discipline of the establishment, and actin=

appeal in her study, while Miss Morley supplied the initiative, and kept th=
e girls interested in a=20

large number of pursuits and hobbies which could be carried on within the w=
alls of the house and=20

garden.  As regards the fifty-six British and American maidens who made up =
this brisk little=20

community we will leave some of them to speak for themselves in the next ch=
apter.     CHAPTER=20

III  Hail, Columbia!   Irene, finding herself in her new form, looked round=
 inquiringly. A few of the=20

girls with whom she had taken coffee were seated at desks in the same room,=
 but the rest of the=20

faces were unfamiliar. Her teacher entered her name on the register, and se=
emed to expect her to=20

understand the lesson which was in progress, but the subject was much in ad=
vance of what she=20

had hitherto learned at Miss Gordon's, and it was very difficult for her to=
 pick up the threads of it.=20

She grew more and more bewildered as the afternoon passed on, and though Mi=
ss Bickford gave=20

her several hints, and even stopped the class once to explain a point, Iren=
e felt that most of the=20

instruction had been completely over her head. It was with a sense of inten=
se relief that she heard=20

the closing bell ring, and presently filed with the rest of the school into=
 the dining-room for tea. Her=20

place at table was between two girls who utterly ignored her presence, and =
did not address a=20

single remark to her. Each talked diligently to the neighbor on either side=
, but poor Irene seemed=20

an insulator in the electric current of conversation, and had perforce to e=
at her meal in dead=20

silence. She was walking away afterwards in a most depressed condition of m=
ind, when at the=20

door some one touched her on the arm.  "You're wanted in the senior recreat=
ion room," said a=20

brisk voice. "Rachel has convened a general meeting and told me to tell you=
. So hurry up and=20

don't keep folks waiting. We want to get off to tennis."  Marveling why her=
 actions should hinder=20

the tennis of the rest of the community, Irene obeyed the message, and pres=
ented herself in the=20

room where she had been introduced on her arrival. It was now full of girls=
 of all ages, some=20

sitting, some standing, and some squatting on the floor. Rachel Moseley, th=
e owner of the long=20

dark pigtail, seemed in a position of command, for she motioned Irene to a =
vacant chair, then=20

rapped on the table with a ruler to ensure silence. She had to tap not once=
 but several times, and=20

finally called:  "When you've all done talking I'll begin." There was an in=
stant hush at that, and,=20

though a few faint snickers were heard, most of the audience composed itsel=
f decently to listen to=20

the voice of authority.  "I've called this meeting," began Rachel, "because=
 to-day an unusual thing=20

has happened. Three new girls have arrived, although the term is well under=
 way. By the rules of=20

our society they must give some account of themselves, and we must explain =
what is required=20

from them. Will they kindly stand up?"  Blushing considerably Irene rose to=
 her feet, in company=20

with the dark-eyed damsel who had crossed in the same steamer with her from=
 Naples, and the=20

fair-haired child whom she had privately christened Little Flaxen.  "Name a=
nd nationality?"=20

demanded Rachel, pencil and note-book in hand. She wrote down Irene Beverle=
y, British, without=20

further comment; the fact was evidently too obvious for discussion. At "Mab=
el Hughes, Australian,=20

born in Patagonia," she demurred slightly, and she hesitated altogether at =
"Desiree Legrand."=20

"_That's_ not English!" she objected. "We because they are so easily convey=
ed by the dishonest=20

customer into pocket or muff, can seriously upset the smiling side of the c=
hemist's ledger.  Every=20

night, when at last, laden with gold, he climbs to his bed, he hopes piousl=
y that the morrow may be=20



colder.  And it usually is.  He will soon be a millionaire.  It is only a w=
arm wind that can blow the=20

chemist no good.  I wish I was a chemist, but it is now too late.  Still, I=
 wish I was a chemist.         *=20

THE BEER-FIGHT.  (Suggested by Mr. CHESTERTON's "The Flying Inn.")    Of G.=
 K. C. a tale I=20

tell, of GILBERT CHESTERTON,   And how he met GAMBRINUS once and how they c=
arried on.=20

Each roared a lusty challenge out, as only topers can,   And sat him down a=
nd called for beer, and=20

then the bout began.    One had a _Seidel_ to his hand, and one a pewter po=
t;   They drank=20

potations pottle deep, in fact they drank a lot.   And as they drank the ba=
rrels dry they rolled them=20

on the floor,   And sang a stave and drained a quart and called aloud for m=
ore.    Their glowing=20

souls o'ertopped the stars; they had their hearts' desire,   The while the =
world spun round and=20

round its busy track of fire.   "I've lived for this," said G. K. C. and to=
ssed his flaming head;   "_Der=20

Kerl ist stark, das Bier ist gut_," was what GAMBRINUS said.    The sun loo=
ked on, the moon=20

looked on, the comets all stood still   To see this stout and jolly pair wh=
o never had their fill.   And=20

still they drained their beer as if they'd only just begun;   And no one da=
red to interfere to settle=20

which had won.         *       *       *       *       *  PRESSIMISM.  The =

in gloom   With tidings that are ghastly and infernal?     Why dim my morni=
ng eye with tales of=20

doom,   Of flood and fire, of pestilence and drouth--   Leaving me down, di=
stinctly, in the mouth?=20

Why stun me with: "Explosion in a Larder:      Cook and Policeman Blown to =

Poisoned Half a Parish"; "Weather Harder      And Death Rate Rising"; "Poac=

Why blazon blackly forth such blighting news,   Nor give a glimpse of life'=

Why not proclaim such gladness as the following:     "Twins Born in Tooting=
: Trio Doing Well";=20

"Chelsea Churchwarden much Improved, and Swallowing     Beef-Tea With Ease"=
; "A Famous=20

THE CONVERTED STATISTICIAN.  A sudden jolt as we thundered over some points=
 caused me=20

to shoot a piece of bread-and-butter on to the floor. I stooped to pick it =
up.  "Stop a moment,=20

please!" cried my companion. He jumped to his feet and examined it. "Ah," s=
aid he, "buttered side=20

downward!"  "It's always the same," I said, as I jerked the thing viciously=
 out of the window. "It's=20

_always_ buttered side downward."  "No, there you fall into a common error,=
" protested the other.=20

"You may take it that fifty-seven per cent. fall buttered side upward, and =
only forty-three per cent.=20

buttered side downward."  "H'm," I said dubiously.  "You must pardon me for=
 my officiousness," he=20

went on, "especially as I have now no=20


_
here, you know!"  "But I'm _not_ French," came the high-pitched voice of th=
e little, fair-haired girl.=20

"I'm as English as anybody. I am _indeed_!"  "Then why have you got a Frenc=
h name?"  "Legrand=20

isn't French--we come from Jersey."  "Very much on the borderland," sniffed=
 Rachel. "What about=20

Desiree? Not much wholesome Anglo-Saxon strong."  I looked at him curiously=
. "Habits?" I said.=20

"Yes, habits. For years I kept an accurate record of every slice of bread-a=
nd-butter I saw fall to the=20

ground. I had better explain myself. Nearly all my life, you must understan=
d, I have maintained the=20

view that the generally accepted theory of the 'cussedness of things' is=20


_
"I was called Desiree because I was so very much desired. Mother says it ju=
st fits me."  An=20

indignant titter went round the room and Rachel frowned.  "I'm afraid you w=
on't find yourself so=20

much desired here," she said sarcastically. "I'll enter you British, though=
 I have my doubts. Now=20

come along, all three of you, and lay your hands on this book. You've got t=
o take an oath of=20

allegiance. I'll repeat the words, and you must say them after me:  "'I her=
eby promise and vow that=20

being of Anglo-Saxon birth I will uphold the integrity of Great Britain and=
 her colonies and of the=20

United States of America, and strive my utmost to maintain their credit in =
a foreign land.' Now=20

then, do you understand what your oath means?"  Her eyes rested on Irene as=
 she asked the=20

question. That much embarrassed damsel stuttered hesitatingly:  "We're not =
to trouble our heads=20

about learning foreign languages?"  A delighted chuckle came from several m=
embers of the=20

audience at this interpretation of the vow. Rachel hastily condescended to =
explain.  "Oh, no! You'll=20

have to study French and Italian, but what we mean is for goodness' sake do=
n't stick on all the airs=20

and graces that some of these foreign girls do. Remember we're plain, whole=
some,=20

straightforward Anglo-Saxons, who play games and say what we wrong. You kno=
w that to most=20

people 'cussedness' is the governing factor of life."  "Rather!" I agreed. =
 "Well, I disbelieved it, and=20

I set to work to collect materials for a book which was to prove my case. F=
or years I incessantly=20

gathered statistics on the subject. Do I bore you?"  "Not at all," I assure=
d him.  "The results were=20

extraordinary. Take, for example, catching trains. It is highly important t=
hat you should catch a=20

train at short notice. In nine cases out of ten, you will say, your taxicab=
 breaks down, or your tram=20

is held up by a block in the traffic, or the current fails on the Undergrou=
nd."  "Certainly it does."=20

"On the contrary--I am speaking from memory, but I think my figures are acc=
urate--the taxicab only=20

breaks down in 1.5 per cent. of cases; with the tram the percentage rises t=
o 1.8; with the=20

Underground it falls to .2."  I gasped.  "Or take the case of studs," he we=
nt on. "You drop a stud,=20

and it promptly and inevitably rolls away into some quite impossible hiding=
-place. So most of us=20

believe. As a matter of fact it only does so approximately three times out =
of a hundred. Or=20

bootlaces. If you are exceptionally late in the morning; your bootlace alwa=
ys snaps, you say. Not=20

at all. It breaks in such circumstances only four times out of a possible h=
undred.=20


_
spade and have done with it. Whatever Italian friends you may make during t=
he holidays please=20

forget them during term-time, and try and imagine that the Villa Camellia s=
tands in Kent or=20

Massachusetts. Do you understand my drift now?"  "Oh, yes!" sighed Mabel la=
nguidly. "Anglo-

American patriotism, crystallized in a nutshell, I suppose! _I'm_ not going=
 to offend your=20

prejudices, I'm sure!"  "You'd better not, or you'll hear about it," said R=
achel, looking at her sharply.=20

"Well, girls, that's the wind-up. The three freshies are admitted and you'v=
e witnessed their vows.=20

Just jolly well take care they keep them, that's all. Juniors are due now a=
t netball practice, and any=20

seniors who want the tennis courts----"  But Rachel's sentence went unfinis=
hed for her listeners=20

were tired of you get a puncture, you fancy that it always occurs on some o=
ccasion when you are=20

sorely pressed for time. Again, not at all. Out of a hundred punctures only=
 seventeen are sustained=20

at such unfortunate moments."  "You seem to have studied the subject pretty=
 deeply," I remarked.=20

"Oh, my dear Sir, I cannot myself recall a tithe of the material I collecte=
d. I carried out my inquiries=20

in every conceivable direction. Suppose we take the obscure case of a--let =
me see--of a burglar.=20

This was one of my most difficult researches. A burglar will assure you, if=
 you happen to be in his=20

confidence, that every time he enters a house, at a moment when absolute qu=
iet is from his point=20

of view essential, a door slams, or a pot of jam falls off a shelf, or a--a=
