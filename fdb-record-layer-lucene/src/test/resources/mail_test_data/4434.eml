was so good a reader as Harold. But the other boys were not jealous, Harold=
 was so good-natured=20

and always ready to read to them.  The Librarian was a very important perso=
nage indeed in=20

Kisington. You see, this was a peaceful Kingdom, where books were more thou=
ght of than bullets,=20

and libraries than battleships. The Librarian wore a splendid velvet gown w=
ith fur upon the hood,=20

and a gold chain around his neck with a medal, and he was second in importa=
nce only to the Lord=20

Mayor himself.  One summer evening the windows of the cottage where Harold =
and his mother=20

lived were wide open, and Harold was reading aloud to her. For a wonder, th=
ey were quite by=20

themselves. The Librarian, who was a lonely old fellow without chick or chi=
ld of his own, happened=20

to be passing down the works in compliance with the terms of this agreement=
 for keeping the=20

Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily comply w=

read so well that he stopped to listen. Presently he tapped on the door and=
 begged to be invited=20

within the better to hear the reading. The widow was very proud and pleased=
, you may be sure.=20

She bade the Librarian welcome, and Harold continued to read until curfew s=
ounded for every one=20

to go to bed. The Librarian patted him on the head and asked if he might co=
me again to hear such=20

good reading. He came, in fact, the very next night.  After that Harold usu=
ally had an audience of=20

at least two on the long evenings, even when the other boys were busy. The =
Librarian became his=20

fast friend. He liked to come to the little cottage better than anywhere el=
se in the world, except to=20

his own library. But at the library he in turn was host, and Harold became =
his guest. And he=20

showed Harold many wonderful things in that library of which no one but the=
 Librarian knew the=20

existence,--strange histories, forgotten chronicles, wonder-tales. Graduall=
y Harold became almost=20

as well acquainted with the books as was the Librarian himself; though, of =
course, he did not at=20

first understand them all. Nothing happens all at once. The other fellows c=
alled Harold the "Book-

Wizard."  The library was a beautiful building on the main square, close by=
 the Lord Mayor's house=20

and the belfry, where swung the great town bell. It was open freely to ever=
y one, from morning=20

until night, and any one could always get any book he wanted, for there wer=
e many copies of each=20

book. The caretakers always knew just where to find the book one wished. Or=
 the reader might go=20

in and choose for himself; which is a pleasanter thing when you have forgot=
ten the name of your=20

book, or do not know just which book you want most until you have looked ab=
out.  The shelves of=20

the library were nice and low, so that, no matter how little you were, you =
could reach the books=20

without standing on tiptoe or climbing a dangerous ladder. And everywhere i=
n the library were=20

well-lighted tables to put books on, and cozy chairs, and crickets for your=
 feet, and cushions for=20

your back. There were wide window-seats, too, where between chapters one co=
uld curl up and=20

look down into a beautiful garden.  The air of the library was always sweet=
 and clean. The books=20

were always bright and fresh. There was no noise, nor dust, nor torn pages,=
 nor cross looks to=20

disturb one. The people who took care of the books were civil and obliging.=
 It was indeed a very=20

rare and unusual library. No wonder Harold and the Librarian and all the ot=
her citizens of Kisington=20

loved it and were proud of it and used it very often.    II: THE SIEGE OF K=
ISINGTON  Now, when=20

Harold was about twelve years old, a terrible thing befell his city. Red Re=
x, ruler of the neighboring=20

land across the border, decided to make war on this peaceful Kingdom, just =
for fun. He was a=20

fierce and powerful King, and he had a fierce and powerful army, always rea=
dy, night and day.=20

One morning, without any warning whatever, they marched right up to the wal=
ls of Kisington,=20

which were never defended, and laid siege to the city. They began to batter=
 the gates and mine=20

the walls and fire into the city arrows and cannon-balls, or whatever were =
the fashionable missiles=20

of that long-past day. The peaceful city was in danger of being utterly des=
troyed.  The people of=20
