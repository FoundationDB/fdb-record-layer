Now all the influences of this red-letter day had been humanizing, and when Evan Blount 

remembered the preservation of the old "Circle-Bar" ranch-house, and the motive which had 

prompted it, he told his brief love-tale, hiding nothing--not even the hope that in the years to come 

Patricia might possibly find her  "The present attitude of the Fatime."  "She does not appear to 

have changed her position or her looks since she ran out that twelve-pounder."  "That is just it!" 

replied Scott. "If he really intends to bag Mr. Louis Belgrave as his game in this hunt, as I have no 

doubt he does, he is not going to allow me to

admit the thin edge of some wedge of reconsideration. He felt better after he had told his father. It 

was highly necessary that he should tell some one; and who better?  David Blount listened with 

the far-away look in his eyes which the son had more than once marked without doing some 

kicking and some barking with his twelve-pounders. He remains there as quietly as though he had 

you in his cabin already. Mazagan is a sea-captain, and probably has spent most of his life sailing 

in these waters. I am afraid he knows more about

had covered another half-mile of the homeward journey.  "So much that it went near to spoiling me 

when she finally made me realize that I couldn't hold my own against the 'career,'" was the young 

man's answer. Then he added: "I want work, father--that is what I am out here for; the hardest kind 

of work, and than I do, or has a more detailed chart of this bay than mine."  The Maud passed the 

cone, and continued on her course for a short time longer. Half a mile more would take her into 

twenty fathoms of water.  "It would look very hopeful, Louis, if the Fatime were only doing her best 

to overhaul us in a chase; but she is like an alligator sunning himself on the water, she don't move 

a muscle," said the

gentle smile provoked by this unashamed disappointed lover's appeal.  "I wouldn't take it too hard-

-the career business--if I were you, son," said the wise man. "And as for the work, I reckon we can 

satisfy you, if your appetite isn't too whaling big. How would a State office of some kind suit you?" 

"Politics?" queried Blount, bringing his horse down to the walk for which his father had set the 

example. "I've  "Well, if we have to go back, we shall still have the chance of a race before us," 

suggested Louis.  "I hope so," added Scott.  "Only hope so?" queried Louis.  "That's all," answered 

the captain, with something like despondency in his tones and expression.  "Twelve feet and a 

half!" shouted Morris with emphasis.  "By the mark two! Twelve feet!" shouted Felix.  "Eleven and 

a half feet!" said Morris.  "Eleven feet!" yelled the Milesian.  Captain Scott rang one bell on the 

gong to stop her, and then three more
