thought as you do, Athos."  "She had a son, that unhappy woman?"  "Yes."  "=
Have you ever heard=20

of him?"  "Never."  "He must be about twenty-three years of age," said Atho=
s, in a low tone. "I=20

often think of that young man, D'Artagnan."  "Strange! for I had forgotten =
him," said the lieutenant.=20

Athos smiled; the smile was melancholy.  "And Lord de Winter--do you know a=

display of Occult=20

"Have you ever seen the queen of England?" inquired D'Artagnan.  "No; but m=

saw her. Did I ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to Marie de M=

know, Athos, you never spoke much of such matters."  "Ah, mon Dieu, yes, yo=

replied; "but then there must be some occasion for speaking."  "Porthos wou=
