Grand Order of St. George he declined to accept, because it is only given t=
o a general who has=20

saved the country from imminent danger, conducted a successful campaign, or=
 gained a great=20

battle. He had not personally performed any of these things, he said; thoug=
h it may be that in this=20

particular posterity will not agree with him. =E2=80=9CThis arm,=E2=80=9D a=
dded he, =E2=80=9Chas done no more than another=20

man=E2=80=99s.=E2=80=9D As for f=C3=AAtes, illuminations, and processions, =
he requested most earnestly that the money=20

which would have been expended upon these should be used for the succour of=
 the widows and=20

orphans made by the war. To insure this as far as he could, he came back to=
 his capital,=20

unannounced and unattended, some days before he was expected. He went first=
 to the Church of=20

Kazan to pray, then to the Winter Palace to see his mother. That was all. N=
ext day there was a=20

solemn thanksgiving service in the cathedral. I trust that to many of us it=
 was no empty ceremony,=20

and that the words, =E2=80=9C_Not us! not us! but His name!_=E2=80=9D went =
up from our hearts as well as from our=20

lips.  =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Yet I will own that at first I was disappointed--a=
nd that _bitterly_--at the self-abnegation of=20

my Czar. But now I am more than content; I am rejoiced that he has put asid=
e the intoxicating cup=20

that was borne to his lips. I am learning to see more honour in humility th=
an in monuments,=20



decorations, high-sounding titles.  =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98He intends soon to ho=
ld a levee for the especial benefit of the=20

officers who have been wounded during the war; and we are invited, each of =
us, to state his wants=20

and desires directly to himself. I will not say that I long for this opport=
unity--nor perhaps could I say=20

it with truth. For I _trust_. I leave with perfect confidence my future--_o=
ur_ future, which is infinitely=20

more--in the hands of my God and of my sovereign.  =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Yester=
day I called upon General Soltikoff,=20

who showed me so much kindness two years ago. He looks greatly aged and bro=
ken; indeed, I=20

fear the days of mourning for the noble old man are at hand. But he was kin=
d and thoughtful as=20

ever. He told me he had just had the honour of presenting a memorial to the=
 Czar upon a matter=20

which nearly concerned me, but that at present he could say no more, as his=
 Imperial Majesty had=20

expressed a wish to be himself my informant. This has piqued my curiosity n=
ot a little, as you may=20

readily imagine. I conclude he will speak to me about it at the levee.=E2=
=80=99=E2=80=9D  This was as much of her=20

letter as Cl=C3=A9mence saw fit to read aloud. One more paragraph may, howe=
ver, be given here: =E2=80=9CMy=20

beloved, I read every day the little book you gave me.=E2=80=9D (The partin=
g gifts of Cl=C3=A9mence to her=20

betrothed had been the sketch of his mother pencilled by her father=E2=80=
=99s hand, and that treasury of=20

heavenward aspiration, so loved by devout and earnest souls like hers, the =
=E2=80=9CImitation of Christ.=E2=80=9D) =E2=80=9CIt=20

is grand and beautiful, but terrible to me. I feel more and more, as I read=
, how full of sin, how=20

utterly unworthy and vile I am--how far from being wholly detached from the=
 world and given up to=20

Christ. Then I go back to my Bible, and that makes me feel my own unworthin=
ess yet more deeply;=20

but it also makes me think of the love of God and the gentleness of Christ,=
 and thinking upon=20

these I have hope. There are some words of yours that often come to my mind=
. You said that the=20

day you saw me first, lying wounded in the hospital, you were surprised and=
 touched to hear me=20

say I could not help rejoicing in the triumph of my Czar, though _I_ had no=
 share in it. You said it=20

made you think that if you truly loved your King and Saviour, you would be =
able even thus to=20

rejoice in him, however it might be with yourself. When I read his own good=
 and gracious words,=20

and think what he is, and what he has done for us, I seem to understand you=
r meaning. But I am=20

very ignorant; and oh, how I need you to teach me--you, beloved, so much wi=
ser and better than I.=20

I often marvel how you deigned to care for me at all. I think it could not =
have come about had not a=20

ray of light reflected from my Czar fallen upon me.=E2=80=9D The letter did=
 not by any means end there; but=20

there may fitly end the extracts presented to the general reader. Of course=
 many courteous and=20

grateful messages to Madame de Salgues, Madame de Talmont, and Henri found =
a place ere it=20

was concluded, and these were duly delivered by Cl=C3=A9mence.  About a wee=
k afterwards another=20

letter arrived, and Henri had now returned to share its tidings. At first C=
l=C3=A9mence did not read any=20

part of it aloud; she only told its contents more or less fully. Afterwards=
 she read some portions of=20

it to her mother. It ran thus:--              =E2=80=9CST. PETERSBURG, _Wed=
nesday Night_.      =E2=80=9CMY=20

BELOVED,--It is with a full heart--half glad, half     sorrowful--that I wr=
ite to thee to-night. God has=20

been good     to me--good beyond my utmost dreams; for has he not given    =
 me _thee_? But in=20

the sweetest cup some longed-for drop     of sweetness is still lacking; in=
 the brightest life some=20

brightness is still wanting--some cherished wish ungranted. God     wills i=
t so, and his will is best.=20

Since my childhood a strong     untold longing has lain hidden in the depth=
s of my heart. Now     I=20

know it can never be fulfilled--never on this side of the     grave. The ol=
d hope, the hope of my=20

boyhood and youth, is gone     from me. I cannot help these few tears which=
 are falling on the=20

page as I write. But do not heed them; they are not tears of     bitterness=
--for I have been=20



comforted. I am going to tell you     how.      =E2=80=9CTo-day the Imperia=
l reception of which I told you was=20

held for     the wounded officers. It was crowded. Amongst those who were  =
   present I saw Count=20

Rostopchine, to whom I shall always feel     grateful, because he was the f=
irst man who gave me=20

work to do,     and bade me go and do it. He looks ill and haggard. It is s=
aid     he sees nothing day=20

or night except the flames of Moscow. The     world gives him the credit of=
 the conflagration; and I=20

cannot     say that in this instance the world is mistaken, although     hi=
therto it has been the=20

fashion here to assume that it was     done by the French. The count has ma=
de himself very=20

unpopular     by his severities towards those who were suspected of favouri=
ng     the invaders, and=20

it is not thought that he will continue in     office. He has nobly refused=
 to accept any compensation=20

for his     own enormous losses in the doomed city.      =E2=80=9CI suppose=
 I am writing all this just to make=20

you a sharer in     my own long suspense and weary waiting. I thought my tu=
rn for     a word from=20

my sovereign would never come, there were so many     present older than I.=
 Besides, on such=20

occasions his Majesty     never is in haste. He speaks to each: the words p=
erhaps are     few, but=20

they are so spoken that each feels that his own     particular case and cir=
cumstances are for the=20

time the sole     objects of attention. But _my_ five minutes came at last,=
     and proved enough to=20

crown my long patience with an abundant     reward. A kindly question or tw=
o about my wound=20

was asked and     answered; and then, without further preface, the Emperor =
spoke     to me of my=20

father. He said that after our first interview     he had requested General=
 Soltikoff to ascertain=20

whether he     yet lived, and that, =E2=80=98during our absence,=E2=80=99 t=
he general had     succeeded in obtaining=20

full information about him. =E2=80=98He will     give you the papers to-mor=
row,=E2=80=99 he added--and paused for a=20

moment. Something in his face told me my father was no more,     and almost=
 unawares the words=20

passed my lips, =E2=80=98He is dead,     sire.=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98I wish I c=
ould say you are mistaken,=E2=80=99 he answered.     =E2=80=98All was=20

different from what we thought. He was never sent     to Siberia. At his ow=
n earnest and=20

impassioned request--the     request of a brave man--his punishment was cha=
nged to that of=20

compulsory service in the army as a private.[56] =E2=80=9CLet me show     m=
y sovereign,=E2=80=9D said he, =E2=80=9Cthat=20

although the enemy of Louis of     France, I am faithful to Catherine of Ru=
ssia.=E2=80=9D Ivan Ivanovitch,=20

he redeemed his word nobly, though not to the Czarina. He     was one of th=
e many gallant men=20

whom I led to their death at     Austerlitz, on the most unfortunate day of=
 my life.[57] His=20

regiment kept its place until not a man was left unwounded.     Will it com=
fort you to know that he=20

died a hero=E2=80=99s death, and     that he died for me?=E2=80=99      =E2=
=80=9C=E2=80=98What more could I desire for him, or for=20

myself?=E2=80=99 I said.     That was nearly all that passed between us. Bu=
t it was enough.     I am=20

comforted concerning my father.      =E2=80=9CI cannot write or think of au=
ght else just now. My dear=20

unknown father! So unfortunate! So young too--scarce older,     when the st=
orm burst upon him,=20

than I am now. What agony     he must have suffered! what desolation! Yet h=
e kept his     sorely-

tried loyalty without a taint; only craving, as his     last boon, leave to=
 die for the sovereign who=20

drove him from     her presence with insult, and doomed him to ruin and dis=
grace.     Surely his=20

heart was true, whatever baseless, fantastic dreams     of liberty and equa=
lity may have set his=20

brain on fire. The     Czar says he died a hero=E2=80=99s death, and that h=
e died _for him_.     Thank God!=20

=E2=80=9CMy Cl=C3=A9mence perhaps will wonder that I said nothing to the   =
  Czar about our future--about my=20

plans, hopes, or prospects.     Truly I had intended, if the opportunity of=
fered, to have     spoken of=20

these. But to-day I could not--I could think of no     subject save one. Fo=
rgive me this delay.      =E2=80=9CIt=20

is late, but I am still sitting at my desk with that     precious sketch be=
fore me which your father=E2=80=99s=20



hand transferred     to paper, and your hand placed in mine. My dear mother=
=E2=80=99s     face seems to=20

look upon me and to say, =E2=80=98I too am comforted     concerning all I l=
ove. Here or elsewhere they are=20

in God=E2=80=99s     keeping. Never, even in their darkest days, did he who=
lly take     away his loving-

kindness from them.=E2=80=99      =E2=80=9CTo-morrow General Soltikoff is t=
o tell me more. Not _much_     more, I=20

suppose. Few particulars of the life and death of a man     degraded to the=
 ranks are ever likely to=20

be known. But had _he_     told me what I know now, how different everythin=
g would have=20

seemed to me to-night!      =E2=80=9CNow it is not late, but early. That is=
 really the light of     dawn, our=20

Northern dawn, which is stealing in pale and faint.     I must put out my l=
amp and lie down, first=20

thanking God for     all his mercies, and praying him to keep me, and those=
 a     thousand times=20

dearer than myself, in the hollow of his hand.     Good-night,--my Cl=C3=A9=
mence, my queen, good-

night!=E2=80=9D              =E2=80=9C_Thursday Morning._      =E2=80=9CI t=

change     everything for thee and me, Cl=C3=A9mence. No, not _change_, onl=
y     clear away our=20

perplexities, and make the crooked places     straight before us. My last n=
ight=E2=80=99s vigil made me=20

rather a late     sleeper this morning, and I woke to find my servant stand=
ing     by my side, with a=20

large packet in his hand bearing the     Imperial seal. You may be sure I l=
ost no time in opening it.=20

Two separate parchments fell out--one the patent renewing in my     favour =
my father=E2=80=99s title of=20

=E2=80=98Prince=E2=80=99 Pojarsky, the other the     title-deeds of his est=
ate, Nicolofsky.[58]      =E2=80=9CI cannot to-day write=20

commonplace words about this; _you_     will read between the lines, and sh=
are the emotions that=20

fill     my heart. Surely God has dealt well with me--infinitely better    =
 than I deserve. It only=20

remains now for estate, title, and all     else that I have and am, to be l=
aid at your feet by your=20

happy,     grateful, and devoted              IVAN.=E2=80=9D     CHAPTER XX=
XII.  TWO RETURNS, ONE OF=20

THEM NOT EXPECTED.    =E2=80=9CI keep my master=E2=80=99s noble name   For =
warring, not for feasting.=E2=80=9D=20

Although every real obstacle to his marriage was now removed, it was severa=
l months before Ivan=20

found himself at liberty to return to France and claim his bride. He had to=
 go to Nicolofsky, to see=20

and set in order his new estate. It is impossible to describe the joy of hi=
s old friends upon that=20

occasion, and the welcome he received from them all, especially from his fo=
ster-parents. One of=20

his earliest acts was to emancipate the starost and his family, making them=
 at the same time a=20

present of their homestead. He bestowed a similar favour upon the mother of=
 Michael; Michael=20

himself, as a soldier, being free already. To Pope Nikita and his wife he c=
ould give little that they=20

cared for, except kindness and sympathy. They had not recovered from their =
deep sorrow for the=20

melancholy fate of his old playfellow, their beloved and only daughter. Amo=
ngst these friends of=20

his boyhood Ivan became once more a boy. He would sit for hours talking to =
=E2=80=9Cbativshka=E2=80=9D and to the=20

company gathered around his hospitable stove, telling them the eventful sto=
ry of the war, as well=20

as his own adventures since they parted.  He could not make this first visi=
t a long one; although he=20

consoled his =E2=80=9Cserfs,=E2=80=9D or rather his friends, with the promi=
se that at no distant period he would come=20

again and take up his abode amongst them. He was obliged to return to the c=
apital in time to=20

accompany the Emperor to the Congress of Vienna, where the brilliant series=
 of f=C3=AAtes and=20

spectacles in which the assembled sovereigns displayed their magnificence m=
ade the presence of=20

such a splendid corps as the Chevalier Guard particularly suitable. But at =
length he succeeded in=20

obtaining the desired furlough, and early in February reached Versailles on=
ce more.  He found=20

Cl=C3=A9mence unchanged, except that the months of separation had added, in=
 his eyes, to her grace=20

and loveliness. Madame de Talmont looked at least ten years younger since t=
he return of her son;=20



but Henri himself seemed older, and wore a grave if not a troubled aspect. =
Madame de Salgues=20

also was ageing quickly: Henri told Ivan she was anxious about Emile, who h=
ad more than once=20

been in danger for acts of boyish insolence and bravado, such as tearing wh=
ite cockades from the=20

breasts of their wearers, and giving a jovial supper to his companions on t=
he 21st of January, the=20

anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI.  =E2=80=9CA wise government,=E2=
=80=9D said Henri during a quiet walk=20

with Ivan in the park of Versailles, =E2=80=9Cwould disregard these follies=
, and a strong government could=20

very well afford to do it. But I fear the government of Louis Dix-huit is n=
ot either wise or strong. He=20

and his courtiers seem to forget that the world has turned round more than =
once since 1789.=20

There is not a little discontent amongst the people, and there is much, ver=
y much amongst the=20

military.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDo _you_ intend to embrace a military life, He=
nri?=E2=80=9D  Henri shuddered. =E2=80=9C_Never_, if I can=20

help it. My experience of soldiering was too terrible.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=
 do not think you need anticipate another=20

Moscow campaign,=E2=80=9D returned Ivan.  =E2=80=9CStill,=E2=80=9D pursued =
Henri, =E2=80=9Cif my country were in danger, I trust I=20

should not be found lacking. My mother is exceedingly anxious to see me in =
the army. But my own=20

tastes lead me in a direction quite different.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTo the ba=
r, perhaps, or the Church?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy mother=20

and my aunt think these the only rational alternatives. They talk grandly o=
f =E2=80=98la noblesse de la robe;=E2=80=99=20

but I confess I do not care for the career of a lawyer, nor do I think I ha=
ve the talents necessary to=20

insure success in it. While as for the Church,--may I speak my whole mind t=
o you in confidence,=20

Prince Ivan?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCertainly you may, my dear friend.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CI am a sincere and earnest believer in=20

Christianity,=E2=80=9D Henri said. =E2=80=9CI have heard the voice of God i=
n the stormy wind and tempest, in the=20

snow and hail which fulfilled his will. But since I have begun to study tha=
t will as revealed in his=20

own Word, a suspicion I cannot dismiss grows and strengthens within me,--I =
fear some of the rites=20

and doctrines of the Church in which I have been brought up are not in acco=
rdance with it.=E2=80=9D  These=20

words awakened for the first time in the mind of Ivan the thought that any =
real or important=20

divergence might exist between the different forms of Christianity. Hithert=
o the world for him had=20

contained two classes only--believers and infidels. These he found and expe=
cted to find=20

everywhere--in the =E2=80=9Corthodox=E2=80=9D Church of his own country, am=
ongst the Catholics of France and the=20

Lutherans of Prussia. The idea suggested by Henri was so new to him that he=
 paused for some=20

moments to consider it before he answered, speaking slowly and with deliber=
ation, =E2=80=9CI am sorry you=20

are troubled with such thoughts, Henri; for doubting keeps us from doing, a=
nd it seems to me that=20

there is a great deal to be done in the world, and little time enough to do=
 it. On the other hand, you=20

would not have the doubts if God had not sent them to you. You are not doub=
ting _him_; you are=20

only doubting in what manner you can serve him best. So you must face your =
doubts and answer=20

them, one way or the other. God will be with you, and lead you to the light=
. But in the meantime=20

you need not sit idle.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTrue, most true. I am longing to =
work for God, who has done so much for=20

me. Besides, what right have I to sit with folded hands, a burden upon my a=
unt? =E2=80=98If any man will=20

not work, neither shall he eat.=E2=80=99 But it is much easier to say what =
I can=E2=80=99t do than what I can. My=20

mother thinks so few things possible to one who has the misfortune, as I fe=
el disposed to call it, of=20

being nobly born.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat would you like to do, in your hea=
rt of hearts, Henri?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf I tell you, will=20

you laugh at me, Prince Ivan?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot I! Why should I? When =
I was a boy I could plough a straight=20

furrow, and I was a fair hand with the reaping-hook. You cannot fancy any o=
ccupation lowlier than=20

these.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI should like to use, not a plough, but a pencil =
and pair of compasses. At Vilna I lodged in=20

the house of an architect, and spent much of my leisure over his books. I w=
as always fond of=20



mathematics, which are useful in that line. Prince Ivan, if you want to bui=
ld a palace on your new=20

estate, I shall be most happy to design it for you.=E2=80=9D  Ivan made him=
 a profound bow, then turned=20

and laid his hand on his shoulder. =E2=80=9CCome to Russia with us,=E2=80=
=9D he said warmly. =E2=80=9CNever was there a=20

better opening for your genius. Think of all Moscow to be rebuilt! Russia o=
ught to be the El Dorado=20

of architects for twenty years to come.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAre you jesting,=
 Prince Ivan?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNever was I more in=20

earnest. The Czar will give you a welcome; and the rather because he shares=
 your tastes himself.=20

In his brief moments of leisure he often amuses himself by taking up a penc=
il and drawing a=20

design for a public building. So he knows how to appreciate what is good.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut--my mother.=20

Already her heart is torn by the thought of parting with Cl=C3=A9mence.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy need there be any=20

parting? I think we could make her happy at Nicolofsky or St. Petersburg. I=
 have often thought=20

about this, and what you have said to me now gives me the courage to propos=
e it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDo you intend=20

to leave the army?=E2=80=9D Henri asked in his turn, perhaps with some desi=
re to change a subject upon=20

which he was conscious of having said more than he intended.  =E2=80=9CI do=
, as soon as peace is=20

thoroughly settled. Of course, until then it cannot be thought of. At the C=
ongress things sometimes=20

looked doubtful enough.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat affair of the kingdom of Po=
land seems to be causing a great deal=20

of trouble,=E2=80=9D said Henri. =E2=80=9CMore than it is worth, _I_ should=
 say; but the Czar does not seem to think=20

so.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhen did _not_ an old wrong cause an infinity of tro=
uble to the man who tries to repair it? By=20

some strange fatality, it is upon him the punishment generally comes, not u=
pon the man who did=20

it,=E2=80=9D Ivan answered. =E2=80=9CThose =E2=80=98designs=E2=80=99 upon P=
oland, for which many who ought to know better are=20

now loudly blaming the Czar, simply mean two things--to Russia an assured p=
eace, guaranteed by=20

a strong, well-defended frontier; and to Poland the longed-for =E2=80=98uni=
ty,=E2=80=99 with as much of the longed-

for =E2=80=98independence=E2=80=99 as she is fit to have and capable of usi=
ng.=E2=80=9D[59]  =E2=80=9CIt seems a strange way of=20

repaying the Poles for having gone away _en masse_ after Napoleon,=E2=80=9D=
 said Henri.  =E2=80=9CIt is the way of=20

my Czar,=E2=80=9D returned Ivan proudly. =E2=80=9CDid you ever hear what pa=
ssed between him and Kosakoski, the=20

most devoted of Napoleon=E2=80=99s Polish adherents? =E2=80=98Is it true th=
at you followed Napoleon to=20

Fontainebleau?=E2=80=99 asked the Czar. =E2=80=98Yes, sire,=E2=80=99 return=
ed the Pole who certainly had the courage of his=20

opinions. =E2=80=98I was with him till he left it; and then, if he had aske=
d me to go with him, I would have=20

done it.=E2=80=99 The Czar was silent for a moment, then he asked him, =E2=
=80=98What is it you wish for most?=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98The=20

restoration of my property,=E2=80=99 said Kosakoski. The Czar immediately w=
rote an order to that effect,=20

and gave it to him. It is well known that his heart, since his boyhood, has=
 yearned to heal the=20

wounds and to atone for the wrongs of Poland. The Polish hostage, Czartoris=
ki, was the friend of=20

his youth; and in their long confidential talks they planned together to bu=
ild the old waste places=20

and gather the scattered members of the oppressed nationality. Now Czartori=
ski reproaches him=20

with doing far too little; while Russia, loyal but perplexed, suspects him =
of doing too much; and=20

Europe accuses him of caring for nothing but the extension of his own front=
ier. And your King,=20

Louis Dix-huit,=E2=80=9D continued Ivan with some bitterness, =E2=80=9Cto w=
hom he gave a throne, treats him as an=20

enemy.=E2=80=9D They had almost reached their home when this was said, so H=
enri was spared the=20

necessity of a rejoinder, nor did he greatly care to make one, Legitimist t=
hough he was.  Many a=20

happy talk had Cl=C3=A9mence and Ivan in those days about things past and f=
uture--things seen and=20

unseen. Their engagement was now openly avowed; the trousseau of the bride =
was in=20

preparation, and all was arranged except the wedding-day. Madame de Salgues=
 was becoming=20

reconciled to an alliance which would give her niece the title of Princess,=
 and was lavish in her=20



presents of jewellery and costly laces. Since the Restoration her life had =
become less secluded;=20

many of the returned _=C3=A9migr=C3=A9s_ frequented her house, and found th=
e young Russian prince, the=20

_futur_ of Mademoiselle Cl=C3=A9mence, a very pleasant addition to their so=
ciety.  One evening=20

Madame de Salgues gave an entertainment to a few of her friends. It was a s=
upper, refined and=20

elegant, but unpretending, such as, in her own words, =E2=80=9Cused to be _=
de bon ton_ before the=20

Revolution and the bourgeoisie spoiled everything, when we did not come tog=
ether to eat and to=20

drink, but to converse and to enjoy one another=E2=80=99s society.=E2=80=9D=
  Upon this occasion her guests=20

thoroughly fulfilled her expectations, with the exception of the youngest o=
f the party. St=C3=A9phanie de=20

Sartines, like a spoiled child, had importuned her father to allow her to a=
ccept Madame de=20

Salgues=E2=80=99s invitation; but having gained her point, she sat absorbed=
 and silent, refusing to eat or to=20

speak, and devoting herself to the contemplation of her idolized friend Cl=
=C3=A9mence, from whom she=20

was so soon to be separated. Ivan pitied the sad-faced little girl, and rem=
embering her exploits at=20

their first meeting, sought to console her with the most tempting of bonbon=
s and preserved fruits;=20

but he could elicit nothing beyond a melancholy =E2=80=9CNo, thank you, mon=
sieur.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou should say M. le=20

Prince, my daughter,=E2=80=9D her father corrected.  =E2=80=9CEn Russie tou=
t faquin est prince,=E2=80=9D[60] observed the=20

audacious Emile to his neighbour, M. de Cranfort.  The latter, though dispo=
sed to regard Ivan in=20

the light of a successful rival, resented the discourtesy of Emile, and sho=
wed it by asking coldly,=20

=E2=80=9CWhat do you say, sir?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t you know th=
e story? Before the war broke out the Czar sent Prince=20

Tufaquin as ambassador to the court of the Emperor, who, during their first=
 interview, called him=20

nothing but =E2=80=98Monsieur.=E2=80=99 One of the bystanders afterwards to=
ld him of the title borne by the envoy.=20

=E2=80=98J=E2=80=99ignorais qu=E2=80=99en Russie _tout faquin_ est prince,=
=E2=80=99 was his answer.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGeneral Buonaparte was a=20

parvenu,=E2=80=9D said M. de Cranfort; =E2=80=9Ctherefore it was not altoge=
ther his fault if he mistook rudeness for=20

wit.=E2=80=9D  Emile =E2=80=9Cknew when he was beaten,=E2=80=9D perhaps bec=
ause he was not an Englishman; so he=20

turned from M. de Cranfort to St=C3=A9phanie, whom he heard deploring that =
Prince Ivan was going to=20

take Cl=C3=A9mence away from them into Russia, where she would be frozen to=
 death in the long cold=20

winter, or eaten by the bears. He bent over her with a comic air of gallant=
ry, and prayed her to be=20

comforted. =E2=80=9C_I_ am infinitely more devoted to you than Mademoiselle=
 Cl=C3=A9mence could ever be,=E2=80=9D he=20

said; =E2=80=9Cand, mademoiselle, _I_ am not going to Russia.=E2=80=9D  But=
 he was scarcely more fortunate here.=20

=E2=80=9COf course you are not,=E2=80=9D returned the young lady sharply, h=
er dark eyes flashing. =E2=80=9CI heard a=20

gentleman tell my father that the Czar is inviting all manner of clever, ca=
pable people to go to=20

Russia; but for any one who is--who is, well, just _ordinary_, you know, he=
 has no particular=20

welcome.=E2=80=9D  In the meantime St=C3=A9phanie=E2=80=99s allusion to Rus=
sian bears had occasioned remark. Ivan=20

told some stories about them which were rather amusing than terrible; for b=
ears, like nobler=20

animals who run away when they are attacked, sometimes make themselves ridi=
culous. Amidst=20

the laughter which followed, Madame de Salgues=E2=80=99s valet made a whisp=
ered communication--

=E2=80=9CMadame, there is an old soldier without, who wishes to speak with =
the young gentleman.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWith=20

what young gentleman?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe young gentleman of the house, =
he says, madame.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen ask M.=20

de Talmont to go to him at once, and see what he wants,=E2=80=9D said Madam=
e de Salgues with a=20

nervous air. The capital and its environs swarmed with old soldiers of Napo=
leon, who were needy=20

and discontented, longing for any kind of political change, and in the mean=
time, if report said true,=20

not always despising robbery and violence as less desirable but still legit=
imate means of repairing=20

their ruined fortunes.  Henri went into the hall, closing the door behind h=
im. He saw in the lamp-



light a tall, gaunt figure, wrapped in an old greatcoat, which covered a sh=
abby uniform, but did not=20

conceal the cross and two medals glittering on the breast of the faded tuni=
c.  =E2=80=9CI beg your pardon,=20

monsieur,=E2=80=9D said the soldier in a voice Henri seemed to recognize. =
=E2=80=9CIt was not you I wished to see,=20

but the young gentleman who belongs to the Ecole Polytechnique.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CSurely I know you--surely I=20

have seen you somewhere,=E2=80=9D said Henri, looking attentively at the br=
onzed, weather-beaten=20

features of the old man.  The veteran shook his head. =E2=80=9CYou have the=
 advantage of me, monsieur,=E2=80=9D=20

he said.  But after another brief scrutiny a light flashed over the mind of=
 Henri, reflecting itself in his=20

face. He advanced cordially and took the soldier=E2=80=99s bony hand in his=
. =E2=80=9CPierre Rougeard of the Old=20

Guard,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9CI am heartily glad to see you. I thought =
you were with the dead.=E2=80=9D  It was natural=20

that the young conscript should remember the old Guardsman who had befriend=
ed him in his hour=20

of need far better than the Guardsman could remember the conscript. Henri w=
as greatly changed,=20

while scarcely anything on this side of the grave could change the hard, we=
ather-beaten features=20

of Rougeard. He was obliged to recall the past to his recollection. =E2=80=
=9CNever,=E2=80=9D said he, =E2=80=9Cdid banquet=20

seem so sweet to me as that repast of horse-flesh to which you bade me welc=
ome by your=20

bivouac fire on the Smolensko road. But we gave you up for lost that terrib=
le day before we=20

crossed the Beresina.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI was made prisoner,=E2=80=9D Roug=
eard answered. =E2=80=9CBut I fell into good hands,=20

and was kindly treated. At the Peace of Paris I came home with the rest--th=
ough it is home no=20

longer without the Emperor,=E2=80=9D he added with a sigh.  =E2=80=9CYou mu=
st have much to tell,=E2=80=9D Henri rejoined;=20

and as the valet passed through the hall, he said to him, =E2=80=9CAlphonse=
, this is an old friend of mine=20

who showed me much kindness while I was in Russia. Take the best care you c=
an of him. By-and-

by,=E2=80=9D he said to Rougeard, =E2=80=9Cwe will finish our conversation.=
=E2=80=9D  He returned to the salon, and related=20

what had passed to Madame de Salgues. That lady, with the characteristic lo=
ve of a=20

Frenchwoman for a little scene, must needs have the old Guardsman brought i=
n, that he might=20

drink the health of Henri, and receive the acknowledgments of his friends f=
or the kindness he had=20

shown him.  So Henri fetched Rougeard, who listened to a little speech from=
 Madame de Salgues,=20

had his hand shaken by Madame de Talmont and Cl=C3=A9mence, and emptied a b=
rimming goblet of=20

champagne poured out for him by Emile.  As he gave back the goblet, he bent=
 forward and=20

whispered a word or two, which made the lad--unused as he was to self-contr=
ol--utter an=20

involuntary cry of amazement, and drop the glass upon the ground.  Of cours=
e every one started=20

and looked at him; and Madame de Salgues asked in alarm, =E2=80=9CWhat is t=
he matter?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNothing,=E2=80=9D said=20

Emile in confusion, stooping to collect the fragments of the broken glass. =
 =E2=80=9CNothing indeed,=E2=80=9D=20

repeated the terrible St=C3=A9phanie. =E2=80=9CYou need not be alarmed, mad=
ame; I heard every word he said,=20

and it was only this, =E2=80=98_The little corporal has come back_.=E2=80=
=99 M. Emile, who is the little corporal?=E2=80=9D=20

Well might she ask the question, for =E2=80=9Call faces gathered blackness.=
=E2=80=9D The party of friends, just=20

before so glad and gay, looked as if a shell had suddenly burst amongst the=
m. M. de Sartines was=20

the first to find a voice. =E2=80=9CGarde,=E2=80=9D he said, turning solemn=
ly to Rougeard, =E2=80=9Csince you have spoken=20

these words you are bound to explain them. I daresay it is mere rumour,=E2=
=80=9D he added, addressing=20

the ladies.  For a moment Rougeard stood irresolute. He had come to impart =
his tidings to Emile,=20

whom he knew already as an ardent Buonapartist, ready to venture his life i=
n the good cause; but=20

to proclaim them in the midst of a circle of Royalists had been far from hi=
s intention. However, he=20

soon recovered his composure. To-morrow all Paris would know the truth; wha=
t did it matter about=20

a few hours? With a simple dignity which was not unbecoming, he answered M.=
 de Sartines, =E2=80=9CI=20



have the honour, monsieur, to belong to the Old Guard, therefore I have hea=
rd to-day what you=20

will all hear to-morrow. The Emperor has set his foot once more upon the so=
il of France. He has=20

landed near Fr=C3=A9jus, in the Gulf of St. Juan.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen b=
y this time he is a prisoner, if he is not shot, or=20

hanged upon the=20

=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf my grandson cannot behave at=20

my table like a gentleman, I will thank him to leave it,=E2=80=9D said Mada=
me de Salgues with a sternness=20

that amazed every one, and was not without its effect upon Emile, who was a=
ccustomed to=20

nothing from her but extreme indulgence.  Ivan, though his own thoughts wer=
e sufficiently=20

sorrowful, felt a compassion for the boy, and a dread, not altogether groun=
dless, of what he might=20

be tempted to do if provoked. Turning to his hostess, near whom he sat, he =
said to her, unheard=20

by the others, =E2=80=9CMadame, I pray of you do not be hard with him. Do n=
ot let him leave us in this way.=20

His exclamation was natural. I should certainly have done the same had I he=
ard the Czar was=20

coming.=E2=80=9D  Cranfort caught the last words, and said with petulance, =
=E2=80=9CIt is all his fault.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhose=20

fault?=E2=80=9D asked a quiet, elderly abb=C3=A9, invited because Madame de=
 Salgues thought no party perfect=20

without a slight, a very slight ecclesiastical flavour.  =E2=80=9CThe fault=
 of the Czar, M. l=E2=80=99Abb=C3=A9,=E2=80=9D returned=20

Cranfort, raising his voice, for the abb=C3=A9 sat at the other side of the=
 table. =E2=80=9CIf the Corsican=20

adventurer succeeds in erecting his standard once more, and torrents of blo=
od are spilt, it will be=20

the result of the imprudent generosity of the Emperor Alexander. No one can=
 pretend that he was=20

not warned. M. de Talleyrand and every man of sense knew that Elba was no p=
lace for=20

Buonaparte. It was keeping a lighted candle at the door of the powder-magaz=
ine.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt did not=20

require the wit of Talleyrand to find _that_ out,=E2=80=9D said M. de Sarti=
nes. =E2=80=9CThe Emperor Alexander may=20

have had political motives of his own sufficient to explain his conduct. Mo=
st probably he had. If not,=20

his championship of the Buonapartes does honour possibly to his heart, but =
little enough to his=20

understanding.=E2=80=9D  Ivan was about to speak, but Henri, with a quick m=
otion of his hand, arrested him.=20

=E2=80=9CNot one word, Prince Ivan,=E2=80=9D he said in a voice low and tre=
mulous with suppressed emotion. =E2=80=9CNot=20

one word from your lips to-night! It is I--I whose life he saved--who must =
defend him. And from=20

what? Is it from the charge of sparing the fallen? of being too generous, t=
oo merciful, too trusting?=20

There are very few who need exculpation from such charges. And I, who but f=
or that mercy of his=20

would now be lying in a nameless grave at Vilna, will not sit by and hear t=
hem.--Messieurs, I am a=20

man of peace; I hate strife and bloodshed; and I thought that never again s=
hould this right hand of=20

mine touch sword or pistol. Yet I am ready, either now or hereafter, with s=
word or pistol, or both,=20

for any gentleman, or any number of gentlemen, who may desire to meet me in=
 this quarrel.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CQuel tapage!=E2=80=9D muttered Emile. =E2=80=9COne man may raise a=
 fine commotion where another may not=20

breathe a word!=E2=80=9D  Madame de Talmont was terrified by a vehemence so=
 foreign to the character of=20

her son. She interposed, explaining that no harm had been intended, and ent=
reating him to=20



recollect himself. M. de Sartines also hastened to apologize. =E2=80=9CI wa=
s not aware, monsieur,=E2=80=9D he said,=20

=E2=80=9Cthat you were under personal obligations to the Czar. Still I cann=
ot hold myself excused, for I=20

should not have used so much freedom in the presence of M. le Prince. I hop=
e he will be good=20

enough to pardon me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo need of that, monsieur,=E2=80=9D=
 returned Ivan. =E2=80=9CThe more freely the conduct=20

of my sovereign is discussed by every loyal Frenchman the more will be his =
honour. The Czar,=E2=80=9D he=20

added proudly, =E2=80=9Chas saved Europe once. If need be, he will do so ag=
ain.=E2=80=9D  Shortly afterwards the=20

guests departed. Henri drew Ivan aside. =E2=80=9CYou will be obliged to lea=
ve us?=E2=80=9D he said in a low voice.=20

=E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D Ivan answered gravely. =E2=80=9CAfter what we have j=
ust heard, I must go immediately to my Czar.=E2=80=9D=20

Henri=E2=80=99s voice dropped still lower, and laying his hand on the shoul=
der of his friend, he said a few=20

earnest words. Ivan answered in the same tone; then, with a countenance won=
derfully brightened,=20

he left the room.  When he was gone, Henri said earnestly, turning to his m=
other and his aunt,=20

=E2=80=9CCl=C3=A9mence and Ivan belong to each other already in the sight o=
f God; why should they not do so=20

also in the sight of man? Months, if not more, may elapse before Ivan can r=
eturn--a long and=20

dangerous campaign, perhaps two, may intervene--how much better a hasty mar=
riage than the=20

wearing suspense and anxiety of a protracted engagement?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CWhat difference can it make?=E2=80=9D=20

asked Madame de Salgues. =E2=80=9CCl=C3=A9mence must of course remain here =
until things are settled.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA=20

very great difference,=E2=80=9D Madame de Talmont answered. =E2=80=9CAs a w=
ife, he can send for her and she=20

can go to him should anything untoward happen--which God forbid,=E2=80=9D s=
he added with a trembling=20

lip. =E2=80=9CGod alone knows what comfort there is in having the right to =
tend, or to mourn.--Henri, I=20

entirely agree with you.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt occurs to me that there is s=
ome one else whose consent will have to=20

be obtained,=E2=80=9D Madame de Salgues observed.  Henri smiled. =E2=80=9CI=
 believe Ivan is this very moment=20

engaged in obtaining it,=E2=80=9D he said.  =E2=80=9CThat being the case,=
=E2=80=9D said Madame de Salgues, =E2=80=9Cand after the=20

opinion your mother has just expressed, it only remains for us to arrange d=
etails.=E2=80=9D  The next=20

morning Cl=C3=A9mence and Ivan were married quietly in the parish church of=
 Versailles. It is possible=20

that the young Russian gave a passing sigh of regret to the touching and be=
autiful ceremonies of=20

his own ritual, which he was obliged to forego. Gladly would =E2=80=9CIvan =
the servant of God=E2=80=9D have been=20

=E2=80=9Ccrowned with Cl=C3=A9mence the handmaid of God,=E2=80=9D as it is =
the use and wont to do with brides and=20

bridegrooms in the Greco-Russian Church. But what did it signify? He was mo=
re than content--he=20

was unspeakably thankful for all that was given him by God and by man.  The=
re was a simple=20

_d=C3=A9je=C3=BBner_, the only guests outside the family circle being M. de=
 Sartines and St=C3=A9phanie, who was=20

greatly consoled by her dignity of bridesmaid. There were brave, loving far=
ewells; and then Ivan=20

rode away to rejoin his comrades and to do his duty in the conflicts that m=
ight yet lie before him=20

and them.     CHAPTER XXXIII.  HIS KING SPEAKS TO THE CZAR.    =E2=80=9CYea=
, thou wilt answer for=20

me, righteous Lord!   Thine all the sorrow, mine the great reward:   Thine =
the sharp thorns, and=20

mine the golden crown;   Mine the life won, and thine the life laid down.=
=E2=80=9D   It is amongst the minor=20

yet very real troubles of life that promptitude, courage, and self-denial s=
o often appear to be=20

wasted. The call to action reaches our ear: we spring up responsive, buckle=
 on our armour, and=20

hasten to the front,--only to hear the bugles sounding the retreat, and to =
find that the conflict has=20

been adjourned _sine die_. So it happened to Ivan. He was stopped on his wa=
y to Vienna by=20

tidings that the Chevalier Guard was now in Poland with the main body of th=
e Russian army. To=20

Poland accordingly he went; but only to linger in enforced idleness day aft=
er day, even week after=20

week, first at Wiasma, and then at Prague. He could not dismiss the thought=
,--Might he not just as=20



well have spent all this time with his bride at Versailles? He certainly mi=
ght, except for the=20

important consideration that it can never be just as well for a man to negl=
ect his duty as to do it.=20

Meanwhile the accounts from France added to his perplexity and uneasiness. =
Napoleon, received=20

everywhere with open arms by the military, swept through the land like an u=
nresisted torrent, and=20

on the 19th of March entered the capital once more. Louis XVIII. abandoned =
it at his approach=20

without striking a blow--a pusillanimity which made old Royalists like De S=
artines and De Cranfort=20

hang their heads with shame. It was natural that Ivan should feel the deepe=
st anxiety about the=20

household at Versailles, and for the sake of those so dear to him he could =
not be otherwise than=20

thankful that a battle had been avoided, although on more public grounds it=
 grieved him to the=20

heart that Napoleon had succeeded so easily in establishing himself once mo=
re in Paris.  During=20

his stay in Prague, Ivan was cheered by a letter from Cl=C3=A9mence, bearin=
g the impress of her own=20

true, tender, and courageous spirit. Henri wrote also, giving a more detail=
ed account of public=20

events; and Emile contributed a version of his own, which was by no means u=
nwelcome. The=20

student of the Polytechnique wrote as though the entire glory of bringing b=
ack the Emperor=20

belonged to him and his schoolfellows; and he exhorted Prince Ivan not to b=
e in the least uneasy=20

about the family at Versailles, assuring him that they would enjoy _his_ po=
werful friendship and=20

protection, with a na=C3=AFve simplicity that gave his correspondent a hear=
ty laugh. =E2=80=9CBut after all,=E2=80=9D=20

thought Ivan, =E2=80=9Csome atonement is due to the vanity of Emile, which =
used to suffer so often from the=20

keen though polished thrusts of his Legitimist friends.=E2=80=9D  All this =
time a burden of pain and=20

apprehension lay heavy on the heart of Ivan. It was probable that by the re=
turn=20

ourselves of the imprudent generosity we admired but could not prevent, tho=
ugh we have now=20

become the victims of it.=E2=80=9D Doubtless Talleyrand only expressed the =
sentiments of all the Royalists=20

of France; yet it was as well for him that he did not at that time fall in =
with the Emperor of Russia=E2=80=99s=20

Chevalier Guard. But infinitely worse to Alexander than all these reproache=
s was the imminent=20

prospect of another great war, to water the soil of Europe with blood and t=
ears, and renew the=20

horrors it had been the dearest wish of his heart to terminate. Ivan was no=
t surprised when a=20

report reached him that the Czar was ill at Vienna. He knew--he was not lik=
ely ever to forget--that=20

each remembrance of the useless slaughter at Austerlitz touched the chords =
of a lasting sorrow.=20

He had heard of the terrible months of depression that followed the murder =
of the Emperor Paul,=20

when the attendants of the new sovereign trembled for his reason or his lif=
e; nay, he himself had=20

witnessed a partial recurrence of the same depression at the time of the de=
ath of Moreau. The sad=20

face of his Czar, as he had seen it then, haunted him day and night, and fr=
om the very depths of=20

his heart the cry went up to heaven, =E2=80=9CO God, uphold and comfort thy=
 servant, who putteth his trust=20

in thee!=E2=80=9D  At last the long-wished-for marching orders came, and th=
e early days of June saw the=20



head-quarters of the Russian army established in Heidelberg, under the pers=
onal command of the=20

Czar.  To the great joy of Ivan he looked well, and what surprised him stil=
l more, instead of the=20

expected depression, there was such brightness in his countenance, such che=
erfulness in his=20

whole demeanour, that he thought some specially good tidings must have arri=
ved. Meeting his=20

friend Tolstoi, he asked him if such were the case. But Tolstoi reported, o=
n the authority of his=20

uncle the Grand Marshal, that there were no good tidings, but rather the re=
verse. Matters, he said,=20

looked very serious. It was to be feared the whole strength of the Allies w=
ould be required to=20

overthrow Napoleon, and a plan of united action was being arranged amongst =
them. The Czar=20

was only anxious to do what was best for the general welfare, and it was pr=
obable he would be=20

called upon to make the first attack; but time and place were as yet uncert=
ain. =E2=80=9CIf I were the Czar,=E2=80=9D=20

Tolstoi added indignantly, =E2=80=9CI would see every Bourbon of them all d=
rowned in the Seine before I=20

would stir a finger to save them. You have heard of the practices of M. Tal=
leyrand--how the old fox=20

induced King Louis to enter into a secret treaty against us with the other =
Powers before the return=20

of Buonaparte, who found the precious document on a table in the Tuileries,=
 where it had been left=20

behind by accident, and sent it to the Czar, just to show him what sort of =
friends he had.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo, I=20

did not hear that,=E2=80=9D said Ivan, keenly interested. =E2=80=9CWell, wh=
at did the Czar do?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CPut it into the fire. =E2=80=98It=20

is not _I_ who am to be thought of,=E2=80=99 he said, =E2=80=98but the peac=
e of the world.=E2=80=99 I think, Prince Ivan,=20

something else will be thought of if we take Paris again and M. de Talleyra=
nd sees fit to stay=20

there.=E2=80=9D  Ivan had abundance of leisure at this time, some of which =
he spent in wandering about the=20

beautiful environs of Heidelberg, looking at the picturesque old town from =
the =E2=80=9CAngel=E2=80=99s Meadow,=E2=80=9D=20

or watching the sun go down behind the shadowy purple hills. He sometimes p=
rolonged these=20

rambles until late in the evening, enjoying the solitude, for thought was b=
usy within him, and had=20

endless materials upon which to work.  On one of these occasions he strayed=
 into a hilly path,=20

secluded from general observation, and found that it led to a cottage, in t=
he window of which a=20

light was placed. He drew nearer, intending to ask his way; for he was surp=
rised to find himself in=20

a place probably not more than a mile from the town, and yet so entirely ne=
w to him. As he=20

approached, he was struck by the singular air of neatness which distinguish=
ed a dwelling that in=20

size and appearance was little more than a labourer=E2=80=99s cabin. Presen=
tly he became aware that two=20

or three other persons were toiling up the pathway. An old man, with a cons=
umptive-looking girl=20

leaning upon his arm, attracted his attention, and after a courteous saluta=
tion, he inquired of him in=20

French, =E2=80=9CWho lives yonder?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat is the dwelling =
of the French lady who speaks so beautifully=20

about our Lord Jesus Christ,=E2=80=9D returned the old man in the same lang=
uage. =E2=80=9CThere is to be a prayer-

meeting to-night, and Ad=C3=A8le and I are going. Will you come too, monsie=
ur? It will do you no harm=20

to remember your Creator in the days of your youth.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI tr=
ust I do remember him,=E2=80=9D said Ivan=20

frankly; =E2=80=9Cbut I shall be glad to come in. I suppose you are all Cat=
holics here?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe good French=20

lady is a Catholic, but the young minister who expounds the Scriptures and =
prays at the meetings=20

is an =E2=80=98Evangelical,=E2=80=99 as they call it, from Switzerland. But=
 they both love the Lord Jesus Christ, and=20

talk as if they had seen him face to face.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAy, indeed th=
ey do,=E2=80=9D the girl said timidly. =E2=80=9CThey make=20

you feel him so near.=E2=80=9D  The old man looked at her affectionately. =
=E2=80=9CThe visits of Madame, and the=20

little meetings in her cottage, have indeed been new life to thee, my child=
,=E2=80=9D he said.--=E2=80=9CYou cannot=20

think, monsieur, what a change there is in her--how much stronger and bette=
r she is since these=20

happy thoughts have come to us.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is true,=E2=80=9D the=
 girl assented. =E2=80=9CLast year I thought I was dying;=20



and oh, monsieur, the grave seemed so dark, so awful! Now the fear of death=
 is quite gone, thank=20

God. Still I think He means to let me stay here a little longer, and I am g=
lad--if it is his will.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCome,=20

dear,=E2=80=9D said her grandfather; =E2=80=9Cthe door is open.--Come, mons=
ieur.=E2=80=9D  Ivan hesitated. =E2=80=9CShall I be=20

welcome?=E2=80=9D he asked.  =E2=80=9COh yes, monsieur. There is a gentlema=
n, the son-in-law of Madame, I=20

believe, who is always there, and another, a tall and handsome officer, who=
 is seldom absent. He=20

seems to be a devout soldier, like Cornelius of old. The rest are only frie=
nds--people like=20

ourselves.=E2=80=9D  Ivan went in, took a seat on a bench beside his new fr=
iends, crossed himself, and=20

bowed his head for a moment in prayer, then looked about him. It was now la=
te, and the little room=20

was lighted, somewhat dimly, with candles of an ordinary kind. Fortunately =
he was placed where=20

he could clearly see the very striking face and figure of the lady whom Ad=
=C3=A8le pointed out to him=20

with the one whispered word--=E2=80=9CMadame.=E2=80=9D Her hair was silver,=
 her face worn and haggard, with the=20

look =E2=80=9Cof one that had travailed sore.=E2=80=9D Less than fifty she =
could not have been--Ivan thought her=20

much more; but hers had been one of those intense and passionate lives whic=
h are measured =E2=80=9Cnot=20

by months and years,=E2=80=9D but by fears and hopes, by joys and sorrows, =
perhaps by raptures and=20

despairs. There was fire in her dark eyes, and upon her pale and wasted fea=
tures an expression at=20

once of dreamy mysticism and of ecstatic ardour. In youth she had been very=
 beautiful, but no=20

mere physical beauty could survive the storms that had swept over her. Yet =
some better thing had=20

come to her in place of her faded loveliness; so at least they said who saw=
 her when she spoke of=20

that which was God=E2=80=99s special gift and message to her soul--=E2=80=
=9Cthe love of Christ which passeth=20

knowledge.=E2=80=9D It was this secret whispered in her ear that, in spite =
of many errors and some serious=20

faults, made Julie de Krudener a power for good in her day and generation. =
She had this treasure=20

in an earthen vessel--in one that was flawed and well-nigh broken; but she =
had it, and gave of it to=20

others.  Though Ivan could read little of this in her face, yet he was grea=
tly struck by its=20

expression. =E2=80=9CShe ought to be a sibyl or a prophetess,=E2=80=9D he t=
hought. The persons on either side of=20

her scarcely attracted his attention at all; they were her son-in-law, the =
Baron de Berckheim, and a=20

young Swiss pastor, whom Ad=C3=A8le called M. Empaytaz.  Just as the clock =
in an adjoining apartment=20

began to strike, the door opened once more, and an officer of tall and comm=
anding aspect entered=20

the room. He went quietly to what was evidently his accustomed place, close=
 to one of the lights,=20

laid a Bible which he had brought with him on the table, and sat down. Ivan=
 found it as much as he=20

could do to suppress a cry of amazement--for it was the Czar. But he held h=
is peace, and neither=20

by look nor sign betrayed what he felt.  A prayer was offered, in which Iva=
n was far too bewildered=20

to join; he scarcely even observed that it was unlike any prayer he had eve=
r heard before, being=20

extempore. Then the young pastor opened his Bible, read a passage, and bega=
n to expound it.=20

But Ivan heard little; for he could not withdraw his eyes from the Czar, wh=
o was listening intently to=20

every word, and who found and read every passage of Scripture referred to, =
making constant use=20

of the little eye-glass he always carried in his sleeve.[61]  After some ti=
me, however, it occurred to=20

Ivan that what interested the Czar so deeply ought to interest him too. Sur=
ely some mysterious=20

power must dwell in the words which could thus enchain a soul already fille=
d with weighty cares,=20

tremendous responsibilities, soaring projects. Of what was the pastor speak=
ing?  A sentence=20

reached his ear that caught and held his thoughts, making him also an absor=
bed and eager=20

listener. It would not be true to say that he forgot thenceforward the pres=
ence of the Czar--_that_=20

would have been impossible--but he felt it only as an influence which added=
 a conclusive weight of=20



evidence and a potent undefinable charm to all that was said.  The pastor=
=E2=80=99s theme was the=20

forgiveness of sins, a subject now full of interest for Ivan. He had long o=
utgrown the stage of=20

spiritual life in which he said that he felt no =E2=80=9Cabyss=E2=80=9D wit=
hin him. Prayer, study of the Scriptures, and=20

intercourse with Cl=C3=A9mence had by this time taught him much of the hidd=
en evil of his own heart. Of=20

his sins he could say now in uttermost sincerity, =E2=80=9CThe remembrance =
of them is grievous unto me;=20

the burden of them is intolerable.=E2=80=9D How he was to be relieved of th=
at burden had never been very=20

clear to him. He knew that pardon had come to mankind through Christ, and t=
hat it was connected=20

in some way with his death upon the cross; but how it was to reach his own =
need, to avail for his=20

own sin, he scarcely knew. He supposed that he ought to read his Bible and =
to pray, to repent=20

truly, to obey God in all things, and to put his whole trust in him;=20

God.=E2=80=9D[62]  A strange new joy burst upon his soul, flooding it with =
sunshine. He knelt down and=20

=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9C_my_ Saviour.=E2=80=9D He=20

knew now what was meant by those words of the apostle, =E2=80=9CTherefore b=
eing justified by faith, we=20

ose from his knees, went to=20

the window of his apartment and looked out. The town clock had just struck =
the second hour after=20

midnight. The scene without was calm and still, sleeping in the soft summer=
 moonlight. It seemed=20

to Ivan a beautiful world, over which God was watching, and which he had so=
 loved as to send his=20

Son to die for it. =E2=80=9CTo die for _me_!=E2=80=9D he said in his heart.=

ed down the silent empty street.=20

Ivan saw it was the Czar, who was only then returning from the cottage on t=
he hill. His attendants=20

were well accustomed to their master=E2=80=99s habit of taking long and lon=
ely walks, and his absence,=20

even for many hours, would occasion neither question nor remark. If, instea=
d of communing with=20

nature, he chose to spend the midnight hours in prayer and study of the Scr=
iptures, none need=20

know it.  But Ivan suddenly remembered that a grand review of the whole Imp=
erial Guard was to=20

take place that morning at six o=E2=80=99clock, so he dismissed the idea of=
 writing at once to tell Cl=C3=A9mence=20

the wonders he had witnessed, and wisely threw himself upon his pallet to s=
natch a few hours of=20

necessary slumber.  When he came to the parade-ground in the morning he fel=
t like one=20

bewildered. There, in the midst of his brilliant staff, their uniforms glis=
tening with gold and jewels,=20

and the costly trappings of their magnificent horses glancing in the sunlig=
ht, stood the Czar, at=20

once the centre and the heart of all that martial pomp and pride. As Ivan, =
in his place in the=20

Chevalier Guard, advanced, retreated, wheeled to the right or the left, in =
instant obedience to the=20

word of command that issued from those imperial lips, he wondered silently =
which was the dream-

-this splendid pageant, or the scene last night in the lowly cottage; but w=
hen he looked again upon=20

the calm and joyous face of the Czar he knew that both were real.  It was n=
