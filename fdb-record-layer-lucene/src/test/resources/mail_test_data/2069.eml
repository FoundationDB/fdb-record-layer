philodendron monstera those who fear _God_. They replied, We have been afflicted before thou camest unto us and since thou hast come unto us.

He was, _
a man because he saith, My Lord is God,--when he hath come unto you with evident proofs from 

your Lord? And if he be a liar, on him [will be] _the evil consequence of_ his lie; but if he be a 

speaker of truth, somewhat of that _punishment with_ which he threateneth you will befall you 

_speedily_. Verily God directeth not him who is a transgressor, _or polytheist_, [and] a liar. O my 

people, ye have the dominion to-day, being overcomers in the land _of Egypt_; but who will 

defend us from the punishment of God _if ye kill his favourite servants_, if it come unto us?[278]--

Pharaoh said, I will not advise you to do [aught] save what I see to be advisable, _which is, to kill 

Moses_; and I will not direct you save into the right way. And he who had believed said, O my 

people, verily I fear for you the like of the day of the confederates,[279] the like of the condition of 

the people of Noah and 'Ad and Thamood and those who [have lived] after them: and God willeth 

not injustice unto [His] servants. And, O my people, verily I fear for you the day of calling (_that is, 

the day of resurrection, when the people of Paradise and those of Hell shall often call one to 

another_). On the day when ye shall turn back _from the place of reckoning unto hell_, ye shall 

have no protector against God. And he whom God shall cause to err shall have no director. 

Moreover, Joseph (_who was Joseph the son of Jacob according to one opinion, and who lived 

unto the time of Moses; and Joseph the son of Abraham the son of Joseph the son of Jacob, 

according to another opinion_) came unto you before _Moses_, with evident _miraculous_ proofs; 

but ye ceased not to be in doubt respecting that wherewith he came unto you, until, when he died, 

ye said _without proof_ God will by no means send an apostle proposition, and gave his word to 

keep the marriage a secret. Heloise and Abelard secretly came back to Paris and were wedded a 

few days later, the ceremony being performed at dawn, in the presence of Fulbert and a few of his 

friends.  But the temporary disappearance from Paris of so noteworthy a person as Abelard could 

not be concealed. The whole town had known of his passion for Heloise, and the gossips now 

guessed, no doubt, why he had disappeared, and why Heloise also had gone. We do not need to 

be told that the surmises made, all so dishonorable to his niece, must have been galling in the 

extreme to Fulbert. He could not endure the shame of his niece, and tried to quell the scandal by 

letting the news of the marriage leak out. Abelard says that Fulbert told it himself, in violation of his 

oath of secrecy--for which we can hardly blame him as much as Abelard does. The devoted 

Heloise, to protect Abelard, flatly denied the marriage; not all Fulbert's entreaties and threats could 

move her to admit that she was anything but Abelard's mistress. Beside himself with anger and 

shame, Fulbert grew so violent that Heloise fled to a nunnery at Argenteuil, near Paris, Abelard 

aiding her in her flight. At Argenteuil Abelard had her dressed in the monastic habit, though she 

did not take the vows.  We must admit that there were some grounds for supposing, as Fulbert 

and his family believed, that Abelard meant to rid himself of his wife by having her shut up in the 

convent: and they had experienced enough of her self-sacrificing firmness to know that she would 

offer no resistance to Abelard's wishes, if such were his wishes. Determined at least to punish 

him, they bribed one of his servants, broke into his house at night, and inflicted upon him the most 

severe and brutal 


_
is a transgressor, _or polytheist_, [and] a sceptic. They who dispute respecting the signs of God, 

without any convincing proof having come unto them, _their disputing_ is very hateful with God 

and with those who have believed. Thus God sealeth every heart (_or the whole heart_) of a proud 

contumacious Heloise was forced to be a nun, Abelard should be fit for nothing but a monk.  The 

perpetrators of this Draconian vengeance fled. Paris was all agog with the shame of the brilliant 

philosopher. There were partisans in plenty on his side, and Abelard takes pleasure in telling us 

that two of the 


_
And Pharaoh said, O Haman, build for me a tower, that I may reach the avenues, the avenues of 

the heavens, and ascend unto the God of Moses;[280] but verily I think him, _namely Moses_, a 

liar _in his assertion that he hath any god but myself_. And thus the wickedness of his deed was 

made to seem comely unto Pharaoh, and he was turned away from the path _of rectitude_; and 

the artifice of Pharaoh [ended] not save in loss. And he who had believed said, O my people, 

follow me: I will direct you into the right way. O my people, this present life is only a temporary 

enjoyment; but the world to come is the mansion of firm continuance. Whosoever doeth evil, he 

shall not be recompensed save with the like of it; and whosoever doeth good, whether male or 

female, and is a believer, these shall enter Paradise; they shall be provided for therein without 

reckoning. And, O my people, how is it that I invite you unto salvation, and ye invite me unto the 

Fire? Ye invite me to deny God, and to associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge; but I 

invite you unto the Mighty, the Very Forgiving. [There is] no doubt but that the [false gods] _to the 

worship of_ which ye invite me are not to be invoked in this world, nor in the world to come, and 

that our return [shall be] unto God, and that the transgressors [shall be] the companions of the 

Fire. And ye shall remember, _when ye see the punishment_, blinded, and mutilated as he had 

been. The justice of the Middle Ages never erred on the side of mercy. Abelard fell into the most 

abject despair, but still we see in him the same dominant regard to his career in the world. When 

his friends came about him, particularly the clerks, with their lamentations and their manifestations 

of compassion, he says: "I suffered more from their compassion than from the pain of my wound; I 

felt my shame more than my actual mutilation." He felt not only the shame, but the ruin of all his 

ambitions. "In this state of hopelessness and of utter confusion it was, I admit, rather a feeling of 

shame than predilection for the vocation that impelled me towards the shades of a cloister." Ever 

ready to obey his wishes, Heloise took the veil in the convent of Argenteuil at the same time that 

Abelard entered the abbey of Saint-Denis. Heloise was not yet twenty; did her youthful heart, full 

of love of life, yearn for the cramped life of the nunnery? We shall later see what she herself says 

upon this score; for the present suffice it to note that even Abelard pauses in the account of his 

woes to praise her complete abnegation of self, and to tell us that she went to the altar where the 

irrevocable vows were to be taken, repeating in the midst of her sobs the lament of Cornelia: "O 

my husband, greatest of men! worthy of a bride far better than I! Had Fate such power 


_
commit my case unto God; for God seeth [His] servants.--_This he said when they threatened him 

for his opposing their religion._ Therefore God preserved him from the evils which they had artfully 

devised (_namely slaughter_), and a most evil punishment encompassed the people of 

Pharaoh,[281] _with Pharaoh himself (namely the drowning); then_ they shall be exposed to the 

Fire morning and evening;[282] and on the day illustrious? Wretch that I am, why did I wed thee 

only to bring woe upon thee? Be thou now avenged in the sacrifice I so willingly make for thee!"--

(Lucan, Pharsalia, VIII., 1. 94.) The convent was to her a punishment; but as she goes to it she 

does not think of her punishment, but only of his.  Let us leave Heloise for the present and pursue 

the story of Abelard. His troubles were just beginning; henceforth almost 


_
_it shall be said unto the angels_, Introduce the people of Pharaoh into the most severe 

punishment.     (xl. 27-49.)   And the nobles of the people of Pharaoh said _unto him_, Wilt thou let 

Moses and his people go that they may act corruptly in the earth, _by inviting to disobey thee_, 

and leave thee and thy gods? (_For he had made for them little idols for them to worship, and he 

said, I am your Lord and their Lord;--and therefore he said, I am your Lord the Most High._) He 

answered, We will slaughter their male children and will suffer their females to live: and verily we 

shall prevail over them. _And thus they did unto them; wherefore the children of Israel complained, 

and_ Moses said unto his people, Seek aid of God, and be patient; for the earth belongeth unto 

God: He causeth whomsoever He will of His servants to inherit it; go wrong with him. Scarcely 

recovered from his injuries, he was besought by his former pupils to resume his lectures, while the 

monks of Saint-Denis, thinking to gain credit through their illustrious recruit, also urged him to 

teach again. These same monks Abelard had found far from congenial. They were covetous, 

narrow-minded, and outrageously licentious. He was, therefore, the more willing to undertake his 

old work, and opened a modest school at the little village of Maisoncelle, in Brie, where the monks 

of Saint-Denis had a priory. Here, once more, crowds came to hear him, and he felt so 

encouraged that he ventured to put in book form some of his theological and philosophical 

opinions, at the instance and for the use of his students. Neither misfortune nor the wish of Job 

that his adversary had written a book had taught him
