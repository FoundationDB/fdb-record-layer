philodendron monstera not even the late Queen or myself. Now, then, to keep=
 my promise. What ho, heralds! Lead forth the maid."  The heralds blew a jo=
yous blast on their trumpets and went to fetch the Princess Agnes. Arthur f=
ound himself thinking of little Margot at the inn, and how sadly it was har=
d for the bees to keep on the wing against such a wind. When it blew strong=

ar. Again and again father put philodendron monstera not even the late Quee=
n or myself. Now, then, to keep my promise. What ho, heralds! Lead forth th=
e maid."  The heralds blew a joyous blast on their trumpets and went to fet=
ch the Princess Agnes. Arthur found himself thinking of little Margot at th=
e inn, and how sadly it was hard for the bees to keep on the wing against s=
uch a wind. When it blew stronger than ever Bobby saw his father thrust a g=
reat paw into the black hole in the tree. Great masses of golden, yellow ho=
ney were put quickly into the jar. Again and again father put _
under the ferns, trying to escape from Arthur's terrible eye.  At last Arth=
ur saw that it was high time=20

to lay aside the magic glass, unless he wished the Dragon to escape by "goi=
ng out" altogether,=20

which would never do. For he must take the creature back to the King.  Now =
was seen the use of=20

the butterfly-net which Arthur had brought all the way from Kisington. With=
 this in his right hand=20

Arthur chased the absurd little Dragon under a stone, and finally threw it =
over the wriggling body,=20

just as one would catch an insect. Hurrah! There was the creature tangled i=
n the net, hissing as=20

loudly as a locust. The terrible Dragon of Hushby was caught!  Arthur took =
from his wallet a reel of=20

thread and tied the Dragon securely, so that he might not escape. And then,=
 chuckling to himself,=20

he strode back to Hushby pulling the Dragon behind him, just as a little bo=
y drags a toy horse by a=20

string. It was a very funny sight!  When he drew near the inn, Margot ran o=
ut to meet him with=20

tears of joy in her eyes, for she had been watching for him all this time. =
Then all the other people=20

came running out, and they cheered lustily when they saw that Arthur was qu=
ite unharmed.  "But=20

what of the Dragon?" they said.  "This of the Dragon!" cried Arthur, drawin=
g from behind him the=20

struggling creature. "Here is the famous Terror of Hushby. Behold what I ha=
ve done to him!"  Folk=20

could scarce believe their eyes. This wriggling little lizard, could he rea=
lly be their famous Dragon?=20

Then they saw his tiny, fiery eyes, and the smoke coming from his funny lit=
tle mouth; and they=20

knew it must be a really, truly Dragon. A great silence fell upon them, and=
 every one looked at=20

Arthur in awe. They believed that he must be a wizard who had magicked the =
Dragon of Hushby.=20

But after that they fell to rejoicing, because now no longer had they anyth=
ing to fear. Arthur had=20

become the hero of Hushby.  They set him on a seat and carried him on their=
 shoulders around=20

the village, with singing and shouting and huzzaing. And the Dragon went wi=
th him, spitting and=20

hissing and lashing his absurd little scaly tail inside a cage made of fine=
 wire. Arthur enjoyed all=20

this greatly. But especially he enjoyed the eyes of little Margot, which fo=
llowed him, full of=20

admiration. And he said to himself, "It is a fine thing to be a hero. But I=
 wish I had not asked for the=20

King's daughter as my reward. I could choose better now!"  When night came =
Arthur slept once=20

more at the inn, with the Dragon in his little cage beside the bed. Arthur =
slept soundly, because he=20

was happy and his heart was honest. But the conquered Dragon did not sleep.=
 You see, his=20

conscience was bad,--he had eaten so many poor and deserving persons. And t=
hat gives the=20

worst kind of indigestion.  There was another who did not sleep. And this w=
as Oscar, the wicked.=20

He had seen the Dragon when Arthur showed him to the people, and he knew th=
at the strange=20

little beast was a treasure worth far more than gold or jewels. For there w=
as not another like it in=20

the whole world. He meant to steal the miniature Dragon and carry it to a f=
ar land, where he could=20

exhibit it in a museum and gain much wealth and honor. Of course, Oscar mea=
nt also to claim that=20

this was a young Dragon which he had taken in a brave struggle with its par=
ents, whom Oscar had=20

killed. In that way, he would become a famous hero.  In the dead of night, =
when all the inn was=20

quiet, Oscar softly climbed up the trellis to the window of the room where =
Arthur slept. In the=20

darkness two tiny red spots showed him where the Dragon writhed and wriggle=
d restlessly.=20

Stealthily Oscar reached out his hand to take the Dragon. But when he did s=
o the Dragon gave a=20

hiss which he meant should shake the house, but which really was no louder =
than the chirp of a=20

cricket. It was loud enough, however, to waken Arthur. The hero sprang from=
 the bed to guard his=20

treasure.  Oscar drew his dagger and rushed upon Arthur. But Arthur had bee=
n careful to sleep=20

with his hand upon his trusty weapon. Swiftly he put the magic glass to his=
 eye and looked at=20



Oscar. And lo! the wicked man shared the Dragon's fate. Gradually he shrank=
 and shrank, and=20

though he struck fiercely with his dagger it was of little moment; for Osca=
r was soon but two inches=20

high, and his dagger's prick was like that of a pin, which made Arthur laug=
h.  Arthur was merciful,=20

and did not put him out entirely, as he could easily have done. Dropping th=
e glass from his eye he=20

picked up in his thumb and finger the little fellow, struggling like a beet=
le, and put him under an=20

overturned pint-pot for safe keeping. There Oscar remained until morning, a=
 restless neighbor of=20

the restless Dragon.  But Arthur said to himself, "I have used the magic gl=
ass twice. I must be=20

careful, for it can be used only once more before its virtue fades; and tha=
t chance must be saved=20

to make my Princess little, since, alas! I must marry her and not dear Marg=
ot." Then Arthur went=20

back to bed and slept soundly until morning.  On the morrow Arthur said not=
hing about this night's=20

event to Mine Host nor to the admiring crowd who that Uncle Grumpy brought,=
 for it is so long ago.=20

But I don't think I would like to have bread and honey every morning. Some =
mornings I would like=20

preserves, or eggs, or fish."  His father laughed. "Well, you won't have to=
 eat honey every morning=20

unless you wish. I only meant that there would be lots of it. Now let us ge=
t started."  Father Bear=20

now looked carefully at all his claws to see that they were quite sharp. In=
 order to climb the tree he=20

would have to dig his claws deeply into the bark.  Bobby Bear, noticing thi=
s, said: "Why do you=20

look to see if your claws are sharp, father? You filed them this morning be=
fore we came away."  "I=20

know I did," his father answered, "and I am not worrying about the claws on=
 my hands. However,=20

we have done such a lot of walking, I thought perhaps the claws on my feet =
might have worn some=20

on the rough ground."  Bobby looked up at the tree where all the bees were =
flying around and=20

around, keeping up a most noisy buzzing. Then he thought of his father goin=
g all alone up the tree=20

to take the honey from all those bees, which surely would not want to part =
with it.  Father Bear did=20

not seem to be afraid. He had already dug his claws into the thick bark at =
the foot of the tree and=20

was about to climb.  "Now, my boy," he said to Bobby, "when I get a little =
way up the tree, you=20

hand me the big brown jar. I can easily climb the rest of the way with one =
hand, because the claws=20

in my feet are very big and strong."  Bobby picked the jar up. My, but it w=
as heavy. It was just=20

about as much as he could do to lift it. However, he managed to get it well=
 above his head and=20

walked toward the tree.  He was so anxious to reach his father, that he did=
 not look where he was=20

going and his foot caught in a root, and down went Bobby, jar, and all.  [I=
llustration: HIS FOOT=20

CAUGHT IN A ROOT]  The terrible crash made Father Bear turn around and when=
 he saw what=20

had happened he grew quite angry.  "Dear me, what a careless boy you are. T=
hat was the biggest=20

jar your mother had. Now, not only shall we have to give up getting the hon=
ey today, but when we=20

come tomorrow we will have to bring two small jars. This will mean you will=
 have to carry one of=20

the jars, as a punishment."  Bobby felt tears coming to his eyes, but being=
 a brave little bear, he=20

struggled against crying. "I am very sorry, father, and I will be more care=
ful next time."  "Being=20

sorry won't bring the jar back," but you could see from his face, he was no=
t as angry as he had=20

been at first when the jar smashed.  All the way home, Bobby was very quiet=
. Every once in a=20

while his father would look at him and think that Bobby was still worrying =
about the broken jar. This=20

was not a fact, however, for something had happened which Bobby felt he cou=
ld not tell his father.=20

It had taken place while the two bears were walking from tree to tree looki=
ng for the one that had=20

the most honey. A small tree with very bright green leaves had bent over an=
d touched Bobby on=20

the shoulder and had whispered in his ear: "What about Jane Bird? Don't for=
get, you must see her=20



and must not give up until you find her."  Perhaps this, as well as the roo=
t of the big tree had been=20

one of the causes of Bobby's stumbling when he went to give his father the =
big brown jar.  When=20

Father Bear and Bobby Bear reached their cave, Mother Bear was standing wai=
ting for them. The=20

first thing she said was: "Where's the honey? Didn't you bring any?"  Bobby=
 said nothing. He was=20

too ashamed of his carelessness. By this time, Father Bear's anger had all =
gone and he felt sorry=20

for Bobby. So he said to Mother Bear:  "The jar fell to the ground and brok=
e. We're going again=20

tomorrow. It doesn't matter, we can take two small jars."  This did not sat=
isfy Mother Bear,=20

however. "What am I going to do for a big jar?" she asked. "I've had that o=
ne so long I can never=20

get along without it."  "Don't worry, mother," Father Bear answered. "The n=
ext time I go to the=20

store, I'll get you one twice as big as the one that broke, if you wish."  =
After dinner, Bobby came=20

timidly to his mother and asked: "Can I help you wash the dishes?"  "Oh, my=
, what's the matter=20

with the boy? Did you hear that?" she asked Father Bear.  "Oh, that's nothi=
ng, mother. Aren't you=20

always glad to have Bobby help you?" Father Bear was having his after dinne=
r smoke and never=20

liked to be bothered when he was enjoying himself that way. Besides he felt=
 he had scolded=20

Bobby Bear enough and he didn't want Mother Bear to know how the jar had re=
ally been broken.=20

Soon after, both Mother Bear and Father Bear went for their afternoon naps =
and Bobby ran out to=20

play with another little boy-bear who had come to visit him that afternoon.=
  Bobby was not a very=20

good playmate that afternoon, for he could not help thinking from time to t=
ime of what the little tree=20

with the bright green leaves had said to him.     THE BEES CHASE BOBBY   A =
few mornings later,=20

before the sun was up, Father Bear and Bobby were at the bee tree.  They ha=
d brought with them=20

the large brown jar which Father Bear had bought for Mother Bear, as he had=
 promised her he=20


_
triumphant journey to the King. He tied Oscar with thread and put him into =
his wallet, where the=20

wicked fellow snarled and scolded in a chirp that no one could hear. As for=
 the Dragon, Arthur=20

fastened a tiny gold chain about his neck and secured it to his doublet, so=
 that the creature could=20

crawl up and down his shoulder but could not get away. He looked like one o=
f the little chameleons=20

which ladies sometimes wear; though why they like such unhappy living ornam=
ents I cannot tell.=20

VI. THE DRAGON OF HUSHBY, PART III  Amid hurrahs and blessings and a rain o=
f flowers,=20

Arthur said farewell to Margot, who loved him, and to Hushby, which he had =
delivered from the=20

Terror; and once more he journeyed to the King. But this time he went as a =
hero, whose fame had=20

traveled before him.  The King sent heralds and soldiers to meet him, and a=
 golden chariot to bring=20

him to the city. When Arthur reached the palace he found a great banquet pr=
epared, and the King=20

himself came to welcome him and led him to the place of honor. But the Prin=
cess Agnes was not=20

there.  As for the Dragon, every one was mad with delight over the wonderfu=
l little creature. When=20

the King saw him he laughed so that his crown nearly fell into the to get t=
he jar he had had to=20

make a special trip to the store.  There was really no need for Father Bear=
 to have gone into town,=20

as the bear family had sufficient groceries to last another week, but Bobby=
 had urged his father so=20

strongly to go and get the honey, that he had made a special trip to town j=
ust to buy the jar.  It=20

surely was a big, brown jar, much bigger than the one that was broken. Bobb=
y tried to carry it, but=20

it was too heavy for his little arms.  "How will you manage today, father? =
I can't reach the jar up to=20

you, it's too heavy. You will have to get the honey all alone."  "That's al=
l right, my boy. I could have=20

done that yesterday just as well as not. But I wanted to see what kind of a=
 little helper my Bobby=20

was."  Father Bear started up the tree. Bobby watched him climb. He was ver=
y proud of his great,=20

strong father. Bobby wondered when he would be big enough and strong enough=
 to go after=20

honey alone.  It was quite a distance from the ground to where the bees wer=
e, and for some time=20

the bees did not see Father Bear.  When his great, shaggy head appeared in =
front of their house=20

the bees were very angry, and buzzed around making a very loud noise.  "Fat=
her, father," cried=20

Bobby, "be=20


_
hear him spit and hiss like a little tea-kettle. He liked the Dragon much b=
etter in this small edition,=20

for he was more conveniently handled. They placed the Dragon's cage in the =
center of the table,=20

where every one could see him, and the Dragon glared fiercely with his litt=
le red eyes, but no one=20

was afraid. How times had changed since this was the Terror of Hushby!  The=
n the King said:=20

"Brave Arthur, this Dragonet is the choicest treasure of my kingdom. I will=
 keep him in a cage of=20

gold beside my throne, and strangers will come from the ends of the world t=
o see him. It will make=20

my reign famous for all time, and I am very grateful to you. You are a clev=
er fellow, and perhaps,=20

since you have tamed a Dragon, you can tame my daughter as no one else has =
been able to=20

Remember what you told me about what bees do to little bears."  "Don't fear=
 for me, Bobby. My=20

skin is tough and no bee can possibly hurt me. Just watch so that you will =
know how to get the=20

honey when you grow into a big, strong bear."  Father Bear thrust the sharp=
 claws of his two=20

powerful feet into the tree. He pressed the jar against the trunk, holding =
himself firmly by his left=20

hand.  Then with a great blow of his other arm he scattered the bees right =
and left. They roared=20

louder than ever and thousands of them flew around.  Such a great, black cl=
oud was in front of=20

Father Bear's face that Bobby Bear could hardly see him. This time, however=
, he did not call out,=20

for he had faith in his father and knew that he would get the honey and rea=
ch the ground=20

unharmed.  A=20
