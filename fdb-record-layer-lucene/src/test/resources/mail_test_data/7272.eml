clairvoyance and clairaudience of the sensitive who trusts to its records, =
be that sensitive a Hatha=20

Yogi or a medium.  Such, then, is the Occult Science on which the modern As=
cetics and Yogis of=20

India base their Soul development and powers. They are known as the Hatha Y=
ogis. Now, the=20

science of Hatha Yoga rests upon the "suppression of breath," or Pranayama,=
 to which exercise=20

our Masters are unanimously opposed. For what is Pranayama? Literally trans=
lated, it means the=20

"death of (vital) breath." Prana, as said, is not Jiva, the eternal fount o=
f life immortal; nor is it=20

connected in any way with Pranava, as some think, for Pranava is a synonym =
of AUM in a mystic=20

sense. As much as has ever been taught publicly and clearly about it is to =
be found in _Nature's=20

Finer Forces_. If such directions, however, are followed, they can only lea=
d to Black Magic and=20

mediumship. Several impatient Chelas, whom we knew personally in India, wen=
t in for the practice=20

of Hatha Yoga, notwithstanding our warnings. Of these, two developed consum=
ption, of which one=20

died; others became almost idiotic; another committed suicide; and one deve=
loped into a regular=20

Tantrika, a Black Magician, but his career, fortunately for himself, was cu=
t short by death.  The=20

science of the Five Breaths, the moist, the fiery, the airy, etc., has a tw=
ofold significance and two=20

applications. The Tantrikas take it literally, as relating to the regulatio=
n of the vital, lung breath,=20

whereas the ancient Raja Yogis understood it as referring to the mental or =
"will" breath, which=20

alone leads to the highest clairvoyant powers, to the function of the Third=
 Eye, and the acquisition=20

of the true Raja Yoga Occult powers. The difference between the two is enor=
mous. The former, as=20

shown, use the five lower Tattvas; the latter begin by using the three high=
er alone, for mental and=20

will development, and the rest only when they have completely mastered the =
three; hence, they=20

use only one (Akasha Tattva) out of the Tantric five. As well said in the a=
bove stated work,=20

"Tattvas are the modifications of Svara." Now, the Svara is the root of all=
 sound, the substratum of=20

the Pythagorean music of the spheres, Svara being that which is affairs in =
order. He called for=20

D'Artagnan, but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him, =
D'Artagnan not being on=20

service. In about ten minutes D'Artagnan appeared at the door, followed by =
the inseparable=20

Porthos.  "Ah, come in, come in, Monsieur d'Artagnan!" cried the cardinal, =
"and welcome your=20

friend too. But what is going on in this accursed Paris?"  "What is going o=
n, my lord? nothing=20

good," replied D'Artagnan, shaking his head. "The town is in open revolt, a=
nd just now, as I was=20

crossing the Rue Montorgueil with Monsieur du Vallon, who is here, and is y=
our humble servant,=20

they wanted in spite of my uniform, or perhaps because of my uniform, to ma=
ke us cry 'Long live=20

Broussel!' and must I tell you, my lord what they wished us to cry as well?=
"  "Speak, speak."=20

"'Down with Mazarin!' I'faith, the treasonable word is out."  Mazarin smile=
d, but became very pale.=20

"And you did cry?" he asked.  "I'faith, no," said D'Artagnan; "I was not in=
 voice; Monsieur du Vallon=20

has a cold and did not cry either. Then, my lord----"  "Then what?" asked M=
azarin.  "Look at my hat=20

and cloak."  And D'Artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and t=
wo in his beaver. As=20

for Porthos's coat, a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and =
a pistol shot had cut his=20

feather in two.  "Diavolo!" said the cardinal, pensively gazing at the two =
friends with lively=20

admiration; "I should have cried, I should."  At this moment the tumult was=
 heard nearer.  Mazarin=20

wiped his forehead and looked around him. He had a great desire to go to th=
e window, but he=20

dared not.  "See what is going on, Monsieur D'Artagnan," said he.  D'Artagn=
an went to the window=20

with his habitual composure. "Oho!" said he, "what is this? Marechal de la =
Meilleraie returning=20

without a hat--Fontrailles with his arm in a sling--wounded guards--horses =
bleeding; eh, then, what=20



are the sentinels about? They are aiming--they are going to fire!"  "They h=
ave received orders to=20

fire on the people if the people approach the Palais Royal!" exclaimed Maza=
rin.  "But if they fire, all=20

is lost!" cried D'Artagnan.  "We have the gates."  "The gates! to hold for =
five minutes--the gates,=20

they will be torn down, twisted=20

t of the life-wave," the=20

emanation of the One Life. The Great Breath spoken of in our first volume i=
s ATMA, the etymology=20

of which is "_eternal motion_." Now while the ascetic Chela of our school, =
for his mental=20

development, follows carefully the process of the evolution of the Universe=
, that is, proceeds from=20

universals to particulars, the Hatha Yogi reverses the conditions and begin=
s by sitting for the=20

suppression of his (vital) breath. And if, as Hindu philosophy teaches, at =
the beginning of kosmic=20

evolution, "Svara threw itself into the form of Akasha," and thence success=
ively into the forms of=20

Vayu (air), Agni (fire), Apas (water), and Prithivi (solid matter),(833) th=
en it stands to reason that=20

we have to begin by the higher _supersensuous_ Tattvas. The Raja Yogi does =
not descend on the=20

planes of substance beyond Sukshma (subtle matter), while the Hatha screame=
d D'Artagnan,=20

throwing open the window.  In spite of this recommendation, which, owing to=
 the noise, could=20

scarcely have been heard, two or three musket shots resounded, succeeded by=
 a terrible=20

discharge. The balls might be heard peppering the facade of the Palais Roya=
l, and one of them,=20

passing under D'Artagnan's arm, entered and broke a mirror, in which Portho=
s was complacently=20

admiring himself.  "Alack! alack!" cried the cardinal, "a Venetian glass!" =
 "Oh, my lord," said=20

D'Artagnan, quietly shutting the window, "it is not worth while weeping yet=
, for probably an hour=20

hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the Palais Royal, =
whether they be=20

Venetian or Parisian."  "But what do you advise, then?" asked Mazarin, trem=
bling.  "Eh, egad, to=20

give up Broussel as they demand! What the devil do you want with a member o=
f the parliament?=20

He is of no earthly use to anybody."  "And you, Monsieur du Vallon, is that=

Some Tantrikas locate the three Nadis, Sushumna, Ida and Pingala, in the me=
dulla oblongata, the=20

central line of which they call Sushumna, and the right and left divisions,=
 Pingala and Ida, and also=20

in the heart, to the divisions of which they apply the same names. The Tran=
s-Himalayan school of=20

the ancient Indian Raja Yogis, with which the modern Yogis of India have li=
ttle to do, locates=20

Sushumna, the chief seat of these three Nadis, in the central tube of the s=
pinal cord, and Ida and=20

Pingala on its left and right sides. Sushumna is the Brahmadanda. It is tha=
t canal (of the spinal=20

cord), of the use of which Physiology knows no more than it does of the spl=
een and the pineal=20

gland. Ia and Pingala are simply the sharps and flats of that _Fa_ of human=
 nature, the keynote=20

and the middle key in the scale of the septenary harmony of the Principles,=
 which, when struck in=20

a proper way, awakens the sentries on either side, the spiritual Manas and =
the physical Kama, and=20

subdues the lower through the higher. But this effect has to be produced by=
 the exercise of will-

power, not through the scientific or trained suppression of the breath. Tak=
e a transverse section of=20

the spinal region, and you will find sections across three columns, one of =
which columns transmits=20

the volitional orders, and a second a life current of Jiva--not of Prana, w=
hich animates the body of=20

man--during what is called Samadhi and like states.  He who has studied bot=
h systems, the  "I=20

should give up Broussel," said Porthos.  "Come, come with me, gentlemen!" e=
xclaimed Mazarin. "I=20

will go and discuss the matter with the queen."  He stopped at the end of t=
he corridor and said:  "I=20

can count upon you, gentlemen, can I not?"  "We do not give ourselves twice=
 over," said=20

D'Artagnan; "we have given ourselves to you; command, we shall obey."  "Ver=
y well, then," said=20

Mazarin; "enter this cabinet and wait till I come back."  And turning off h=
e entered the drawing-

room by another door.     48. The Riot becomes a Revolution.   The closet i=
nto which D'Artagnan=20

and Porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing-room where the =
queen was by=20

tapestried curtains only, and this thin partition enabled them to hear all =
that passed in the adjoining=20

room, whilst the aperture between the two hangings, small as it was, permit=
ted them to see.  The=20

queen was standing in the room, pale with anger; her self-control, however,=
 was so great that it=20

might have been imagined that she was calm. Comminges, Villequier and Guita=
nt were behind her=20

and the women again were behind the men. The Chancellor Sequier, who twenty=
 years previously=20

had persecuted her so ruthlessly, stood before her, relating how his carria=
ge had been smashed,=20

how he had been pursued and had rushed into the Hotel d'O----, that the hot=
el was immediately=20

invaded, pillaged and devastated; happily he had time to reach a closet hid=
den behind tapestry, in=20

which he was secreted by=20


_
enormous difference between the two: one is purely psycho-physiological, th=
e other purely=20

psycho-spiritual. The Tantrists do not seem to go higher than the six visib=
le and known plexuses,=20

with each of which they connect the Tattvas; and the great stress they lay =
on the chief of these,=20

the Muladhara Chakra (the sacral plexus), shows the material and selfish be=
nt of their efforts=20

towards the acquisition of powers. Their five Breaths and five Tattvas are =
chiefly concerned with=20

the prostatic, epigastric, cardiac, and laryngeal plexuses. Almost ignoring=
 the Ajna, they are his=20

brother, the Bishop of Meaux. Then the danger was so imminent, the rioters =
came so near,=20

uttering such threats, that the chancellor thought his last hour had come a=
nd confessed himself to=20

his brother priest, so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered.=
 Fortunately, however, he=20

had not been taken; the people, believing that he had escaped by some back =
entrance, retired and=20

left him at liberty to retreat. Then, disguised in the clothes of the Marqu=
is d'O----, he had left the=20

hotel, stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been =
killed=20
