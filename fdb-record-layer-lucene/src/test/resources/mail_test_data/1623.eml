philodendron monstera of the window.  So there lay the Water-Lily with its fine white petals on the dirty ground.    POWDER-POST  By C. A.

you were born for. In any case you will have to grow a little prettier, you gray, ugly thing,"  "Yes, 

that is the worst part of it," the Larva answered sadly. "I don't know myself how it will come about, 

but I hope it _will_ come about some time or other. That is why I crawl about down here and eat all 

the little creatures I can get hold of."  "Then you think you can attain to something great _by 

feeding! _" the Water-Lily said, with a laugh. "That would be a funny way of getting up in the 

world."  "Yes; but I believe it is the right way for me!" cried the Dragon-Fly Grub earnestly. "All day 

long I go on eating till I get fat and big; and one fine day, as I think, all my fat will turn into wings 

with gold on them, and everything else that belongs to a proper Dragon-Fly!"  The Water-Lily 

shook its clever white head, "Put away your silly thoughts," it said, "and be content with your lot. 

You can knock about undisturbed down here among my leaves, and crawl up and down the stalk 

to your heart's desire. You have everything that you need, and no cares or worries--what more do 

you want?"  "You are of a low nature," answered the Larva, "and therefore you have no sense of

become a Dragon Fly." And then it crawled right down to the bottom of the water to catch more 

creatures and stuff itself still bigger.  But the Water-Lily lay quietly on the water and thought things 

over. "I can't understand these animals," it said to itself. "They knock about from morning till night, 

chase one another and eat one another, and are never at peace. We flowers have more sense. 

Peacefully and quietly we grow up side by side, bask in the sunshine, and drink the rain, and take 

everything as it comes. And I am the luckiest of them all. Many a time have I been floating happily 

out here on the water, while the other flowers there on dry land were tormented with drought. The 

flowers' lot is the best; but naturally the stupid animals can't see it."  When the sun went down the 

Dragon-Fly Larva was sitting on the stalk, saying nothing, with its legs drawn up under it. It had 

eaten ever so many little creatures, and was so big that it had a feeling as if it would burst. But all 

the same it was not altogether happy. It was speculating on what the Water-Lily had said, and it 

could hardly get to sleep the whole night long on account of its unquiet thoughts. All this 

speculating gave it a headache, for it was work which it was not used to. It had a back-ache too, 

and a stomach-ache. It felt just as though it was going to break in pieces, and die on the spot. 

When the sky began to grow gray in the early morning it could hold out no longer. "I can't make it 

out," it said in despair. "I am tormented and worried, and I don't know what will be the end of it. 

Perhaps the Water-Lily is right, and I shall never be anything else but a poor, miserable Larva. But 

that is a fearful thing to think of. I did so long to become a Dragon-Fly and fly about in the sun. Oh, 

my back! my back! I do believe I am dying!"  It had a feeling as if its back was splitting, and it 

shrieked with pain. At that moment there was a rustle among the rushes on the bank of the 

stream.  "That's the morning breeze," thought the Larva; "I shall at least see the sun when I die." 

And with great trouble it crawled up one of the leaves of the Water-Lily, stretched out its legs, and 

made ready to die.  But when the sun rose, like a red ball, in the east, suddenly it felt a hole in the 

middle of its back. It had a creepy, tickling feeling, and then a feeling of tightness and oppression. 

Oh, it was torture without end! Being bewildered, it closed its eyes; but it still felt as though it were 

being squeezed and crushed. At last it suddenly noticed that it was free; and when it opened its 

eyes it was floating through the air on stiff, shining wings, a beautiful Dragon-Fly. Down on the leaf 

of the Water-Lily lay its ugly gray Larva case.  "Hurrah!" cried the new Dragon-Fly. "So I have got 

my darling wish fulfilled!" and it started off at once through the air at such a rate that you would 

think it had to fly to the ends of the earth.  "The creature has got its desire at any rate," thought the 

Water-Lily. "Let us see if it will be any the happier for it."  Two days later the Dragon-Fly came 

flying back, and seated itself on the flower of the Water-Lily.  "Oh, good-morning," said the Water-

Lily. "Do I see you once more? I thought you had grown too fine to greet your old friends."  "Good-

day," said the Dragon-Fly. "Where shall I lay my eggs?"  "Oh, you are sure to find some place," 

answered the flower. "Sit down for a bit, and tell me if you are any happier now than when you 

were crawling up and down my stalk, a little ugly Larva."  "Where shall I lay my eggs? Where shall 

I lay my eggs?" screamed the Dragon-Fly, and flew humming around from place to place, laid one 

here and one there, and finally seated itself, tired and weary, on one of the leaves.  "Well?" said 

the Water-Lily.  "Oh, it was better in the old days--much better," sighed the Dragon-Fly. "The 

sunshine is really delightful, and it is a real pleasure to fly over the water; but I have no time

"kutsu"     I  IHME   Kazan makasi neti ja liikahtamatta, harmaa kuono etukplien vliss, silmt 

puoliummessa. Kallio tuskin olisi saattanut nytt elottomammalta kuin hn: lihaskaan ei vavahtanut, 

karvakaan ei liikkunut, silmluomikaan ei vrhtnyt. Ja sittenkin hnen uljaan ruumiinsa joka ainoa villi 

verenpisara kiiti sellaisessa kiihtymyksen kuohunnassa, jota Kazan ei viel ollut milloinkaan ennen 

kokenut; jntevien lihasten joka hermo ja sie oli kirell kuin terslanka. Ollen neljnneksi osaksi syntyn 

susi, kolmeksi neljsosaksi rekikoira, hn oli elnyt elmns nelj vuotta ermaassa. Hn oli saanut kokea 

nlkiintymisen tuskia ja tiesi mys, mit paleleminen oli. Hn oli kuunnellut perimmisen pohjolan pitkin 

in tuulten ruikutusta autioilla tasangoilla, kuullut tulvien ja kosken jymin ja myrskyn mahtavasti 

myllertess kyyristytynyt kokoon. Hnen kurkkunsa ja kylkens olivat tappeluista arpeutuneet ja silmt 

olivat lumituiskujen tuottamista rakkuloista punaiset. Hnt sanottiin Kazaniksi, Villikoiraksi, koska hn 

oli jttilinen lajiansa ja yht peloton kuin ne miehet, jotka hnt ajoivat jtyneen maailman vaarojen halki. 

Pelkoa hn ei ollut milloinkaan tuntenut -- tt ennen. Hn ei ollut milloinkaan ennemmin havainnut 

itsessn halua _livist_ -- eip edes sin kauhun pivn metsss, jolloin hn oli tappelunsa surmannut ison 

harmaan ilveksen. Hn ei tiennyt, mik hnt nyt pelotti, mutta tunsi olevansa toisessa maailmassa, 

jossa monet seikat hnt hmmensivt ja kammottivat. Hn silmili nyt ensi kertaa sivistynytt maailmaa. 

Hn toivoi, ett isnt palaisi thn merkilliseen huoneeseen, johon oli hnet jttnyt. Huone oli tynnns 

kauheita esineit. Seinill oli suuria ihmiskasvoja, mutta ne eivt liikkuneet eivtk puhuneet, vaan 

tuijottivat hneen oudolla tavalla, jolla hn ei viel milloinkaan ennen ollut nhnyt ihmisten katselevan. 

Hn tosin muisti nhneens ern isntns lumessa makaamassa, hyvin hiljaisena ja hyvin kylmn, ja oli 

istahtanut takakoivilleen ja ulissut kuolinlaulua; mutta nm seinill riippuvat ihmiset nyttivt elvilt ja 

tuntuivat sittenkin kuolleilta.  kki Kazan heristi hieman korviaan. Hn kuuli askelia, sitten hiljaista 

puhelua. Toinen oli hnen

have been so terribly busy, I tell you. In the old days I had nothing to think about; now I have to fly 

about all day long to get my silly eggs disposed of. I haven't a moment free. I have scarcely time to 

eat."  "Didn't I tell you so?" cried the Water-Lily in triumph. "Didn't I prophesy that your happiness 

would be hollow?"  "Good-bye," sighed the Dragon-Fly. "I have not time to listen to your 

disagreeable remarks. I must lay some more eggs." But just as it was about to fly off the Starling 

came.  "What a pretty little Dragon-Fly!" it said; "it will be a delightful tit-bit for my little ones." 

Snap! it killed the Dragon-Fly with its bill, and flew off with it.  "What a shocking thing!" cried the 

Water-Lily, as its leaves shook with terror. "Those animals! those animals! They are funny 

creatures. I do indeed value my quiet, peaceful life. I harm nobody, and nobody wants to pick a 

quarrel with me. I am very luck--"  It did not finish what it was saying, for at that instant a boat se 

sai hness aikaan lievn vavistuksen! Aikoja sitten, luultavasti jo penikkapivinn, hn oli ollut unissaan 

kuulevinaan sellaista naurua, kuin nyt tmn nuoren naisen. Siit kajahti yhtaikaa ihmeellinen 

onnentunne, ihmeellisen rakkauden vrhdys ja koko olennon suloisuus, joka sai Kazanin 

kohottamaan ptns heidn tullessaan sisn. Hn katsoi suoraan heihin, punaisten silmien sihkyess. kki 

hn ksitti, ett nainen nhtvsti oli rakas hnen isnnlleen, sill isnnn ksivarsi oli hnen vytisilln. Valon 

hohteessa, hn nki, ett naisen tukka oli hyvin vaalea, ja ett hnen kasvoissaan oli _bakneesh_-

kasvin helenpunavri ja hnen kirkkaissa silmissn _bakneesh_-kukan sini. Samassa nainen nki hnet 

ja sykshti huudahtaen hnt kohden.  "Seis!" huusi mies. "Se on vaarallinen! Kazan --"  Nainen oli 

polvillaan hnen vieressn, untuvanpehmoisena, suloisena ja ihanana, silmin loistaessa ihmeellisesti 

ja molempien ktten ollessa hnt koskettamaisillaan. Pitisik

Ellen, who sat in the boat. "I will have it!" She leant over the gunwale and wrenched off the flower. 

When she had got home she put it in a glass of water, and there it stood for three days among a 

whole company of other flowers.  "I can't make it out," it said on the morning of the fourth day. "I 

have not come off a bit better than that miserable Dragon-Fly."  "The flowers are now nykkist? 

Olikohan tuo nainen joku seinll olijoista ja hnen vihollisensa? Karkaisiko hn kiinni valkeaan 

kurkkuun? Hn nki miehen rientvn esiin kuolonkalpeana. Sitten naisen ksi laskeusi hnen phns ja tm 

kosketus sai vristyksen kiitmn hnen lvitsens, vavahuttaen joka hermoa. Molemmin ksin nainen 

kohotti hnen ptns. Hnen kasvonsa olivat ihan lhell, Kazan kuuli
