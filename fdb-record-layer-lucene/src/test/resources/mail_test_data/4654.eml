he had stretched out a hand and firmly grasped the proconsul's coat sleeve.=
 This gesture, however, instead of pacifying the apparently terror-stricken=
 maniac, seemed to have the effect of further exasperating his insensate fe=
ar. With a loud oath he tore himself free from Chauvelin's grasp.  "Ten tho=
usand devils," he cried hoarsely, "who is this fool who dares to interfere =
with me? Stand aside man ... stand aside or...."  And before Chauvelin  "Sh=
e likes it still--likes it better."  "And she _does_ it--sometimes?"  "Yes,=
 often--always."  "Why?"  "Because Mr Sutherland advises me--and I like Mr =
Sutherland."  "Does my Slowfoot expect me to like work too, and to _do_ it?=
" asked La Certe with a peculiar glance.  "We cannot like what we don't lik=
e, though we may do it," answered the wife, drawing perilously near to the =
metaphysical, "but Slowfoot expects nothing.  She waits.  My Francois is no=

round the carriage, and the two men had much ado to push their way through =
by a vigorous play=20

of their elbows.  "Citizen Carrier!" cried Chauvelin at the top of his voic=
e, trying to dominate the=20

hubbub, "one minute ... I have excellent news for you.... The English spy..=
.."  "Curse you for a set=20

of blundering fools," came with a husky cry from out the darkness, "you hav=

my coach.... Lalouet--do not leave me."  Chauvelin had by this time succeed=

to the forefront of the crowd: Martin-Roget, tall and powerful, had effectu=
ally made a way for him.=20

Through the dense gloom he could see the misshapen form of the proconsul, w=
ildly gesticulating=20

with one arm and with the other clinging convulsively to young Lalouet who =
already had his hand=20

on the handle of the carriage door.  With a quick, resolute gesture Chauvel=
in stepped between the=20

door and the advancing proconsul.  "Citizen Carrier," he said with calm det=
ermination, "on my oath=20

there is no cause for alarm. Your life is absolutely safe.... I exhausted b=

before, and glaring affectionately at Slowfoot, who was stirring something =
in a pot over the fire.=20

The little one--rapidly becoming a big one, and unquestionably by that time=
 a girl--crouched at her=20

father's side, sound asleep, with her head resting on his leg.  She no long=

father's pipe.  "Have you heard that Kateegoose is dead?" asked Slowfoot.  =
"No--how did he die?"=20

"He was met on the plains by enemies, killed, and scalped."  "That is sad--=
very sad," said La=20

Certe.  "The world is well rid of him," observed Slowfoot; "he was a bad ma=

her lord; "it is necessary to get rid of a bad man somehow--but--but it is =
sad--very sad--to kill and=20

scalp him."  La Certe passed his fingers softly among the locks of his slee=
ping child as if the fate=20

of Kateegoose were suggestive!  Then, turning, as from a painful subject, h=
e asked--  "Does our=20

little one never smoke now?"  "No--never."  "Does she never wish for it?"  =
"Slowfoot cannot tell=20

what our little one wishes," was the reply, "but she never gets it."  La Ce=

time, and then asked--  "Does=20
