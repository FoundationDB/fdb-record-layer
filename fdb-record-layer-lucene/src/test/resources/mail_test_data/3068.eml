tendencies of his youth. He was married and of a home-keeping disposition, =
and all that Henriet=20

could throw in his way of stimulating tasks and congenial society, in addit=
ion to the formidable=20

orders for which he had contracted, detained him hardly longer than a year.=
 Upon leaving he made=20

over all his Parisian plates save those of the great sieges to Henriet, who=
se name as publisher=20

appears upon them.  Callot's return to Nancy marked the close of the second=
 period of his art, the=20

period in which he painted battles with ten thousand episodes revealed in o=
ne plate, and so=20

accurately that men of war kept his etchings among their text-books for pro=
fessional reference.=20

The next demand that was made upon him to represent the downfall of a brave=
 city came from=20

Louis XIII, upon the occasion of his entering Nancy on the 25th of Septembe=
r, 1633. By a ruse=20

Richelieu had made the entry possible, and the inglorious triumph Louis dee=
med worthy of=20

commemoration by the accomplished engraver now his subject. Neither Callot'=
s high Lorraine=20

heart nor his brilliant instrument was subjugated, however, and he respectf=
ully begged the=20

monarch to absolve him from a task so revolting to his patriotism. "Sire," =
he said, of command to=20

face to the rear, and the gallant regiment, as cool as if on drill, faced a=
bout, marched deliberately a=20

few yards toward the ravine--Churchill walking his horse before them--then =
turned and resumed=20

firing.  Meanwhile the lancers were driving the Indiana and Arkansas volunt=
eers off the plateau,=20

and cutting off the riflemen in the mountain from the main army. These, per=
ceiving the danger, and=20

trusting that the lancers would be checked by the Arkansas and Kentucky cav=
alry, toward which=20

they were approaching, abandoned their position and came running down the m=
ountain-side, with=20

a view of cutting their way back to the batteries. But the mounted voluntee=
rs made but a brief=20

stand against the impetuous charge of the lancers, and Ampudia=E2=80=99s li=
ght infantry no sooner saw the=20

riflemen move than they followed close on their heels, firing as they went.=
 The slaughter of our=20

poor fellows was dreadful; the Texans were annihilated. In one confused mas=
s, riflemen and=20

volunteer cavalry, Arkansans and Kentuckians were driven back by the advanc=
ing columns of the=20

enemy, and little was wanted to complete the rout. Vainly did the officers =
try to rally the fugitives.=20

No sooner had a handful of men been=20

of Lorraine, and I cannot believe it my duty to do anything contrary to the=
 honor of my Prince and=20

my Country." The king accepted his remonstrance in good part, declaring tha=
t Monsieur of=20

Lorraine was very happy to have subjects so faithful in affection. Certain =
courtiers took Callot to=20

task, however, for his refusal to obey the will of His Majesty, and to them=
 Callot responded that he=20

would cut off his thumb rather than do violence to his sense of honor. Some=
 of the artist's=20

historians have made him address this impetuous reply to the king himself, =
but M. Meaume=20

reminds us that, familiar with courts, he knew too well the civility due to=
 a sovereign to make it=20

probable that he so forgot his dignity. Later the king tried to allure Call=
ot by gifts, honors and=20

pensions, but in vain. The sturdy gentleman preferred his oppressed prince =
to the royal favor, and=20

set himself to immortalizing the misfortunes of his country in the superb s=
eries of etchings which=20

he called "_Les Miseres de la Guerre_." He made six little plates showing i=
n the life of the soldier=20

the misery he both endures and inflicts upon others. These were the first f=
ree inspiration of the=20

incomparable later set called "_Les Grandes Miseres_," "a veritable poem," =
M. Meaume declares,=20

"a funeral ode describing and deploring the sorrows of Lorraine." These sor=
rows so much afflicted=20

him that he would gladly have gone back to Italy to spend the last years of=
 his life, had not the=20

condition of his health, brought on by his indefatigable labor, prevented h=
im.  He lived simply in the=20

little town where he had seen his young visions of the spirit of art, walki=
ng in the early morning with=20

his elder brother, attending mass, working until dinner time, visiting in t=
he early afternoon with the=20

persons, many of them distinguished and even of royal blood, who thronged h=
is studio, then=20

working until evening. He rarely attended the court, but grew constantly mo=
re quiet in taste and=20

more severe in his artistic method, until the feeling for the grotesque tha=
t inspired his earlier years=20

were hardly to be discerned. Once only, in the tremendous plate illustratin=
g the Temptation of=20

Saint Anthony, did the Mexicans scattered them. Thus fell Captain Lincoln--=
a chivalrous spirit, who=20

was struck to the earth by two balls in the act of cheering on a small part=
y of Kentuckians to hold=20

their ground.  [Illustration: BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA  (From a print of the t=
ime)]  At this perilous=20

moment the rattle of musketry was drowned by a tremendous roar pf cannon in=
 the direction of the=20

pass. The Mexicans under Villamil had approached within range, and Captain =
Washington, who=20

had sworn to hold the pass against any odds, was keeping his word. The gunn=
ers had been wild=20

with ardor and suspense all morning; they were now gratified, and, though t=
hree guns had been=20

taken from the battery, they poured such a murderous fire upon Villamil=E2=
=80=99s column as it approached=20

through the narrow pass that, after wavering a moment, it scattered, and mo=
st of the men sought=20

refuge in the ravines. The moment they broke the Second Illinoisans, who ha=
d been stationed at=20

the pass, eagerly followed their colonel, Hardin, to the plateau, to share =
the dangers of their=20

comrades. Almost as soon McKee=E2=80=99s Kentuckians and Bragg=E2=80=99s ba=
ttery came plunging through the=20

gullies on the west of the pass and joined them; while Sherman=E2=80=99s gu=
ns were speedily brought up=20

from the rear. Thus the First Illinoisans were saved, and grape and caniste=
r mowed down the=20

Mexican masses at the foot of the mountain.  Still, the light infantry unde=
r Ampudia were pressing=20

on by the left to the rear of Wool=E2=80=99s position. In half an hour the =
pass might have been turned. Most=20

providentially at that moment Taylor arrived with Davis=E2=80=99 Mississipp=
i riflemen and May=E2=80=99s dragoons.=20

The former barely stopped an instant for the men to fill their canteens, th=
en hastened to the field.=20

Boiling with rage, Davis called on the Indiana volunteers to form =E2=80=9C=
behind that wall,=E2=80=9D pointing to his=20

men, and advance against their enemy. Their colonel, Bowles, the tears stre=
aming down his face,=20



finding all his appeals fruitless, seized a musket and joined the Mississip=
pians as a private. Time=20

could not be lost; Ampudia was close upon them; Davis formed and advanced w=
ith steady tread=20

against a body more than five times his strength. A rain of=20

f forty-three. Still a=20

young man, he had passed through all the phases of temperament that commonl=
y mark the transit=20

from youth to age. And he had used his art in the manner of a master to exp=
ress the external=20

world and his convictions concerning the great spiritual and ethical questi=
ons of his age. He=20

enunciated his message distinctly; there were no tender gradations, no unce=
rtainties of outline or=20

mysteries of surface in his work. It is the grave utterance of the definite=
 French intelligence with a=20

note of deeper suggestion brought from those regions of ironic gloom in whi=
ch the Florentine=20

recorded his sublime despair.     CARLO CRIVELLI     VI  CARLO CRIVELLI   A=
mong the more=20

interesting pictures acquired by the Metropolitan Museum within the past tw=
o years are the panels=20

by Carlo Crivelli, representing Mississippians, but no man pulled a trigger=
 till sure of his mark.=20

Then those deadly rifles blazed and stunned the Mexican advance. A ravine s=
eparated them from=20

the enemy; Davis gave the word, and, with a cheer, down they rushed and up =
the other side; then=20

forming hastily, with one awful volley they shattered the Mexican head and =
drove them back to=20

cover.  But the cavalry had crept round the mountain and were descending on=
 the hacienda. They=20

were Torrejon=E2=80=99s brigade, splendid fellows, mostly lancers, and brim=
ful of fight. Opposed to them=20

were Yell=E2=80=99s Arkansas and Marshall=E2=80=99s Kentucky mounted volunt=
eers--less than half their number.=20

Hopelessly these brave fellows stood, firing their carbines as the foe appr=
oached; but the last man=20

was still taking aim when the lancers were upon them like a whirlwind. The =
brave Yell was dashed=20

to the earth a corpse, and Lieutenant Vaughan fell from his=20

technical skill than his contemporary, Mantegna, he has at once a warmer an=

and a more modern feeling for natural and significant gesture. His earliest=
 known work that bears=20
