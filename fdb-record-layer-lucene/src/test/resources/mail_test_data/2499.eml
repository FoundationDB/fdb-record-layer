they make their candles of their own tallow?  My mother did not cook,--she was a special 

seamstress servant. They had fireplaces on the plantation and they always used tallow candles at 

the doctor's place until after the 'mancipation, then the doctor was one of the first ones to buy coal 

oil lamps.  12. Did you use an open well or pump to get the water?  No, we went to the spring to 

get the water. We toted it in cedar buckets. The spring was boxed into a well shaped hole, deep 

enough to dip the water out of it. It was the best water. They had a town pump at Macon.  13. Do 

you remember when you first saw ice in regular form?  Yes. They had icicles in Georgia.  14. Did 

your family work in the rice fields or in the cotton fields on the farm, or what sort of work did they 

do?  My father was a blacksmith. He did all kinds of blacksmithing. He even made plows.  15. If 

they worked in the house or about the place, what sort of work did they do?  My mother was one 

of the best seamstresses; she sewed all day long with her fingers. She made the finest silk 

dresses and even made tailored suits.  16. Do you remember ever helping tan and cure hides and 

pig hides?  They did those things on the plantation. They cured goat skins and sheep skins, too. 

The sheep skins would dry so slowly that they would let the slaves lie on them at night to keep 

them warm and hasten the drying.  17. As a young person what sort of work did you do? If you 

helped your mother around the house or cut firewood or swept the yard, say so.  I cleaned and 

dusted and waited on the table, made beds and put everything in order, washed dishes, polished 

silverware and did the most trusty work.  18. When you were a child do you remember how people 

wove cloth, or spun thread, or picked out cotton seed, or weighed cotton, or what sort of bag was 

used on the cotton bales?  I did not need to to that of the guider of a machine. Machinery worked 

by relays of men is, no doubt, one of the principal solutions of our industrial problems, and of the 

social problems connected with them. Some seem to fancy that it is the universal solution; but we 

cannot run reaping machines in the winter or in the dark.  High wages, and the independence of 

the labourers, compel economy of labour. Economize labour, cries Lord Derby, the cool-headed 

mentor of the rich; we must give up our second under-butler. When the labourer is dependent, and 

his wages are low, the most precious of commodities, that commodity the husbanding of which is 

the chief condition of increased production, and of the growth of national wealth, is squandered 

with reckless prodigality. Thirty years the labourers of Egypt wrought by gangs of a hundred 

thousand at a time to build the great Pyramid which was to hold a despot's dust. Even now, when 

everybody is complaining of the dearness of labour, and the insufferable independence of the 

working class, a piece of fine lace, we are told, consumes the labour of seven persons, each 

employed on a distinct portion of the work; and the thread, of exquisite fineness, is spun in dark 

rooms underground, not without injury, we may suppose, to the eyesight or health of those 

employed. So that the labour movement does not seem to have yet trenched materially even on 

the elegancies of life. Would it be very detrimental to real civilization if we were forced, by the 

dearness of labour, to give up all the trades in which human life or health is sacrificed to mere 

fancy? In London, the bakers have struck. They are kept up from midnight to noon, sometimes far 

even into the afternoon, sleepless, or only snatching broken slumbers, that London may indulge its 

fancy for hot bread, which it would be much better without. The result of the strike probably 


_
ginned the cotton on the plantation. They used a horse to pull the gin.  They weighed the cotton 

with a beam and weight. A good slave picked 200 lbs of cotton in a day. Nancy could pick 300 or 

400 lbs in a day. She'd go out early in the day and run in ahead of the sun and no one would know 

she had been out. That's how she would get ahead of the rest.  19. Do you remember what sort of 

soap they used? How did they get the lye for making the soap?  They made soft soap boiled in a 

big kettle. They made the lye out of ashes packed in an old barrel that has already been in part 

conceded, a more wholesome kind of bread, such as will keep fresh and palatable through the 

day, and cleaner baking; for the wretchedness of the trade has made it vile and filthy, as is the 

case in other trades besides that of the bakers. Many an article of mere luxury, many a senseless 

toy, if our eyes could be opened, would be seen to bear the traces of human blood and tears. We 

are like the Merchant Brothers in Keats:--    "With her two brothers this fair lady dwelt,   Enriched 

from ancestral merchandize,   And for them
