/**
 * A {@link QueryParser} that changes the way by which stop words in the query are handled.
 * Stop words are not indexed, which means that a query for {@code +the} will not match a document that has "the" in it
 * (because of the "+" in the query and the fact that the "the" is not indexed).
 * In the cases where users are adding search terms that are prefixes of stop words (e.g. {@code +the*}) we want to match
 * documents that have suffixes of the stop words (e.g. "these") but not be blocked by the stop words themselves.
 * As a result, this parser relaxes the query requirement (removed the "+") from stop words search terms.
 * Note that normally, for search terms that are not prefix queries (ones that do not end with "*"), the analyzer will handle
 * the stop words removal, so this is not necessary here.
