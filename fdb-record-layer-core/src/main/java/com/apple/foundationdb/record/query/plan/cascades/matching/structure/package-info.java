/**
 * Classes related to the Cascades matcher system and its implementation.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.query.plan.cascades Cascades} planner is based on a system of rules, each of which is
 * defined by a matcher expression and a method that is applied when an expression matches a given matcher expression.
 * A matcher is represented by an implementation of the {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.query.plan.cascades.matching.structure.BindingMatcher}
 * interface and is responsible for inspecting the structure of a planner expression, determining
 * whether it matches an expression, and providing bindings to access particular substructures of the expression during
 * the execution of the rule. These bindings are exposed by the {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.query.plan.cascades.matching.structure.PlannerBindings}
 * class.
 * </p>
