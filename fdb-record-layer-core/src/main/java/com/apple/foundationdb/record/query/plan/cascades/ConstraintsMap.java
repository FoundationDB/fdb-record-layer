/**
 * A map to keep track of constraining attributes for an expression reference. References ({@link Reference})
 * are a central part of the memoization effort within the {@link CascadesPlanner}. Member expressions contained in
 * a reference all yield the same final result not taking into account physical properties such as sorted-ness,
 * existence of duplicates, etc. A set of plan members of a reference can be partitioned into subsets by physical
 * attributes in order to be used by conscious rules that are dependent on a particular set of properties. Many times
 * we need to create all possible plans in the anticipation that these plans are all consumed by other implementation
 * rules later on. That is not guaranteed, though, and in reality a large set of plans does not get used due to an
 * incompatible physical attribute. In any case, the planner must explore plan variations once created even though
 * the resulting structures may not get used at all. In essence, we would like to avoid the creation of useless plans
 * if at all possible.
 *
 * A map of interesting constraints is used by a reference to "push down" such a constraint through the data
 * flow graph. The "pushing down" is facilitated by rules that are executed by the {@link CascadesPlanner} much like
 * other rules yielding new {@link RelationalExpression}s or {@link PartialMatch}es. The only, and very important,
 * difference in concept is that the information is passed downwards instead of bubbling up like all the other structures.
 *
 * The planner needs to make sure that expression references are explored, and if necessary, re-explored if new
 * interesting properties are declared through the execution of other planner tasks.
 * Planner rules ({@link CascadesRuleCall}) can declare to interest in the change of a constraint which then signals to
 * the planner to trigger a re-exploration using that rule if an constraint changes on that reference.
 *
 * The map implementation uses a logical clock and a watermark system to understand if a re-exploration becomes
 * necessary.
