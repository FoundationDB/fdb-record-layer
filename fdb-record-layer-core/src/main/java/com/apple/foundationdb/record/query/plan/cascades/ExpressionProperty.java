/**
 * An interface for certain Cascades-style properties, which are measurable features of an expression other than the
 * structure of the expression tree. In particular, a {@code ExpressionProperty} is a property that depends on (much of)
 * the contents of the subtree rooted at the expression on which it is evaluated, rather than just a finite depth set
 * of paths as a {@link BindingMatcher} would. For example,
 * the sort order and set of record types produced by a
 * {@link RelationalExpression} could be a
 * {@code ExpressionProperty}.
 *
 * <p>
 * To avoid littering {@link RelationalExpression} classes with methods for various properties, properties are implemented
 * using a variant of the hierarchical visitor pattern over a DAG of {@link RelationalExpression}s, {@link Quantifier}s,
 * and {@link Reference}s.
 * A property can be evaluated against an expression tree by having the visitor traverse a DAG of heterogeneous objects
 * where expressions are said to own quantifiers which range over expression references which then contain expressions
 * again. Shared subgraphs are visited multiple times. If desired, the caller must ensure that a subgraph is not
 * visited more than once.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the methods {@link #evaluateAtExpression}, {@link #evaluateAtQuantifier}, and {@link #evaluateAtRef} are handed the
 * results of the visitor evaluated at their owned quantifiers, references, and members respectively. Since most properties
 * are easy to describe as a recursion with depth one, this makes properties easier to read and write.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the default implementations provided in this interface walk the entire DAG, i.e. all {@link #shouldVisit}
 * methods return {@code true}. That implies that properties have been computed for sub-structures of the graph when
 * {@code evaluateAtXXX()} is called and therefore are not {@code null}. That means that all such arguments can be
 * assumed to be non-nullable even though parameters are annotated as {@link Nullable}. On the other hand, if the
 * implementor also overrides {@code shouldVisit} to return {@code false}, arguments to {@code evaluateAtXXX} may become
 * nullable or contain {@code null}s if they are collections and should be dealt with gracefully.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> the result type of the property
