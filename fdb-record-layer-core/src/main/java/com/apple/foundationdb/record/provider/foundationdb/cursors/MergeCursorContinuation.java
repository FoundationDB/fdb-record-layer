/**
 * Common code for handling the continuations of {@link MergeCursor}s. The continuations for these cursors are constructed
 * from a Protobuf message containing information on the state of each child cursor. This class handles caching
 * that Protobuf message and its byte representation so that subsequent calls to get the continuation are fast. It also
 * abstracts away some of the logic for converting a list of continuations into a single Protobuf message, but this is
 * still somewhat clunky because Protobuf does not support {@link Message} inheritance (which limits the opportunity for
 * polymorphism).
 *
 * @param <B> the builder for message type of the continuation proto message
 * @param <C> type of the continuation
