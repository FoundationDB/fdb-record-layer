/**
 * Classes that inherit from <code>PlannerRule</code> form the base of the Cascades planning system. During the planning
 * process, rules are matched to a current {@link PlannerExpression} and then provide zero or more logically equivalent
 * expressions.
 *
 * The rule matching occurs in two stages: first, the planner examines the {@link #matcher} of the rule,
 * which is a {@link TypeMatcher} expression that expresses the operators that the rule applies to and the hierarchical
 * structure that they take on in the expression tree. If the rule matches the binding, its {@link #onMatch(PlannerRuleCall)}
 * method is called, with a parameter that provides the planner's {@link PlanContext} and access to the map of bindings,
 * among other things. This method can inspect the operators bound during the structural matching and implement other
 * logic.
 *
 * The <code>onMatch()</code> method returns logically equivalent expressions to the planner by calling the
 * {@link PlannerRuleCall#yield(ExpressionRef)} method on its rule call, with a new
 * {@link MutableExpressionRef}. The <code>yield()</code> method can be called more than once, or zero times if no
 * alternative expressions are found.
 *
 * A rule should not attempt to modify any of the bound objects that the rule call provides. Nearly all such objects are
 * immutable, and the mutable ones are hidden behind interfaces that do not expose mutation methods. In particular,
 * a rule should never cast an {@link ExpressionRef} to {@link MutableExpressionRef}, in an attempt to access it.
 *
 * A <code>PlannerRule</code> should not store state between successive calls to {@link #onMatch(PlannerRuleCall)},
 * since it may be reused an arbitrary number of times and may be reinstantiated at any time. To simplify cleanup,
 * any state that needs to be shared within a rule call should be encapsulated in a helper object (such as a static
 * inner class) or documented carefully.
 *
 * @param <T> a parent planner expression type of all possible root planner expressions that this rule could match
 * @see com.apple.foundationdb.record.query.plan.temp
