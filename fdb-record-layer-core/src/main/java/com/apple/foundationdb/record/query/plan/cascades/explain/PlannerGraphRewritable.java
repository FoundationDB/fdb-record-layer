/**
 * Interface to allow {@link RelationalExpression}s to rewrite their own
 * graph representation.
 *
 * This interface allows a {@link RelationalExpression} to create/modify
 * low level planner graph structures while a planner graph is created through an expression walk in
 * {@link PlannerGraphProperty}. Such a rewrite can be useful if the standard representation is confusing, misleading,
 * or just too complicated. For instance, {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.query.plan.plans.RecordQueryPlanWithIndex}
 * additionally creates a separate node underneath the actual plan operator to show the index as a record producer.
 * The nature of the rewrite is highly operator-specific, therefore, the rewrite is not part of the visitor or some
 * other common logic. Expressions that decide to implement this interface must then implement
 * {@link #rewritePlannerGraph} to do the actual rewrite.
 *
 * Implementors of this interface should rewrite the planner graph for both internal show as well as
 * explain purposes. There are two other flavors of this interface: see {@link InternalPlannerGraphRewritable} and
 * {@link ExplainPlannerGraphRewritable}. Those interfaces allow an expression to rewrite only for one of the use
 * cases or differently for either of them.
 *
 * Note that these three interfaces do not form a hierarchy themselves. Also, in order to keep the code from bleeding
 * into general expression structures, we didn't want to have another set of methods on
 * {@link RelationalExpression}.
 * The approach taken here works more like a tag interface that can be chosen by a specific operator to do something
 * very specific without cluttering the general code path.
