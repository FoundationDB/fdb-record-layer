/**
 * This class implements a planHash for the member classes of the query plan.
 * As it is required to separate the plan hashes of various structures in the plan model, we need a way to tell each
 * member of the model apart. Using this class we can implement a stable (withstand JVM restart and class refactorings)
 * base hash for each object that can be added to the rest of the plan.
