/**
 * A <em>correlated</em> entity is one which can only be evaluated as a function of some input (usually a {@link Quantifier}
 * from its relational parent).
 * Since a correlated entity can have multiple correlations to similar quantifiers, a correlation is disambiguated by a
 * {@link CorrelationIdentifier}. Correlated entities are said to be correlated to a quantifier {@code q} if the identifiers
 * returned by {@link #getCorrelatedTo()} set contain
 * the correlation identifier that {@code q} uses.
 *
 * Distinguishing the correlation identifier from the identity of the quantifier object simplifies modifications of the
 * graph, for example while applying transformations during query planning.

 * An correlated object can be <em>rebased</em> using {@link #rebase} and a map of translations from one
 * correlation identifier to another, resulting in a new object of type {@code S} that is
 * identical to {@code this} except that all correlated references in the subtree rooted at this entity
 * (i.e., this object's relational children, predicates, etc.) are replaced with their corresponding identifiers
 * per the map.
 *
 * Since translations are associative we allow to rebase many identifiers in the same {@link #rebase} invocation.
 *
 * As the planner DAG objects are immutable, a rebase operation can be expensive as objects have to be recreated
 * as needed. We follow the ideas of other persistent data structures as we do not require a copy to be made.
 * It is perfectly acceptable to return {@code this} if {@code this} is not correlated to any identifier participating
 * in the translation.
 *
 * This interface defines a {@link #semanticEquals} method that also takes an equivalence map, and determines equality up
 * to the equivalences defined therein. Two correlated entities are equivalent even if they use different names, as long
 * as un-bound correlations can be aligned. For example, in:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * SELECT *
 * FROM T1 a, T2 b
 * WHERE a.x = b.y
 * UNION (SELECT *
 *        FROM T1 c, T2 d
 *        WHERE c.x = d.y)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The two SELECT blocks should be considered equal even though they use different correlation names. The
 * {@link #semanticEquals} introduced here considers these blocks equal using a bi-map that allows for the definition
 * of equivalences among correlation identifiers. In this case
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * (SELECT * FROM T1 a, T2 b WHERE a.x = b.y).equals(SELECT * FROM T1 c, T2 d WHERE c.x = d.y, ImmutableBiMap.of())
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * result (through a series of other steps) in an invocation of
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * (WHERE a.x = b.y).equals(WHERE c.x = d.y, ImmutableBiMap.of(a -> b, c -> d))
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * which then results in a {@code true} as {@code a} is considered to be equal to {@code c} and {@code b} is considered
 * to be equal to {@code d}.
 *
 * @param <S> self type of this. Needed for rebasing to a proper constrained at-least type

     * Determine equality with respect to an equivalence map between {@link CorrelationIdentifier}s based on
     * semantic equality: equality of the plan fragments implementing under the given correlation bindings.
     * The contract of this variant of {@code equals()} differs from its regular Java counterpart.
     * A correlation is mostly just one part inside of composition of objects that expresses a more complicated
     * (correlated) structure such as a filter. For instance {@code q1.x = 5} uses a correlation to {@code q1}.
     * That entity representing the filter is said to be correlated to {@code q1}. Similarly,
     * {@code q1.x = 6} is a different filter and is not equal under any correlation mapping.
     * In contrast, consider a predicate where everything except the correlation is the same, such as {@code q2.x = 5}.
     * Without a binding, these two filters are not the same. However, the filters may be a part of some other entity
     * that can express correlations:
     * {@code SELECT * FROM T as q1 WHERE q1.x = 5} is equal to
     * {@code SELECT * FROM T as q2 WHERE q2.x = 5}. It does not matter that {@code q1} and {@code q2} are named
     * differently. It is important, however, that their semantic meaning is the same. In the example both {@code q1}
     * and {@code q2} refer to a record type {@code T} which presumably is the same record type. Therefore, these two
     * query blocks <em>are</em> the same, even though they are labelled differently.
     * In the context of this method, we can establish equality between {@code q1.x = 5} and {@code q2.x = 5} if
     * we know that {@code q1} and {@code q2} refer to the same underlying entity. The equivalence map passed in
     * encodes that equality between {@link CorrelationIdentifier}s.
     *
     * Note: This method has the same interaction with {@link Object#hashCode()} as the regular {@code equals()}
     *       method. As we can only ever establish true equality using equivalence maps, {@code hashCode()}
     *       implementations in implementors of this interface <em>must not</em> be dependent on any correlation identifiers
     *       used in the structure of the entity. Doing so might violate the fundamental property of hash codes:

     * @param aliasMap a map of {@link CorrelationIdentifier}s {@code ids} to {@code ids'}. A correlation
     *        identifier {@code id} used in {@code this} should be considered equal to another correlation identifier
     *        {@code id'} used in {@code other} if either they are the same by {@link Object#equals}
     *        of if there is a mapping from {@code id} to {@code id'}.
