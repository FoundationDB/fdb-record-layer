/**
 * An expression children matcher that tries to match all children to a single {@link ExpressionMatcher}.
 *
 * Given a single {@code ExpressionMatcher}, this matcher tries to match it to every child. If it matches all of them, it
 * produces a stream of bindings containing the Cartesian product of the streams of bindings from each child, merged
 * using {@link PlannerBindings#mergedWith(PlannerBindings)}. Because the same matcher is used for all children, the
 * merged bindings will map the single child matcher to a collected list of {@link Bindable}s; such a binding must be
 * retrieved using {@link PlannerBindings#getAll(ExpressionMatcher)} rather than the usual {@code get()} method.
