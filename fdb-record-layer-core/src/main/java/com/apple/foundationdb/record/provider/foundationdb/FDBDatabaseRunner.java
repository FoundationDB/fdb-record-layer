/**
 * A context for running against an {@link FDBDatabase} with retrying of transient exceptions.

 * <p>
 * Implements {@link #run} and {@link #runAsync} methods for executing functions in a new {@link FDBRecordContext} and returning their result.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implements {@link #close} in such a way that {@code runAsync} will not accidentally do more work afterwards. In particular, in the case
 * of timeouts and transaction retries, it is otherwise possible for a whole new transaction to start at some time in the future and change
 * the database even after the caller has given up, due to a timeout, for example.
