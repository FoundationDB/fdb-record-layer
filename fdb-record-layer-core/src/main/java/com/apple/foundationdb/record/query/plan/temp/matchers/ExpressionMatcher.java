/**
 * A <code>ExpressionMatcher</code> is an expression that can be matched against a
 * {@link RelationalExpression} tree, while binding certain expressions/references in the tree to expression matcher objects.
 * The bindings can be retrieved from the rule call once the binding is matched.
 *
 * <p>
 * An {@code ExpressionMatcher} interacts with a {@code PlannerExpression} tree using its {@link #matchWith(RelationalExpression)}
 * and {@link #matchWith(ExpressionRef)} methods. At a high level, the {@code matchWith()} methods are responsible for
 * determining whether this matcher matches the root expression or reference passed to {@code matchWith()}. Although
 * {@code ExpressionMatcher}s are themselves hierarchical structures, an {@code ExpressionMatcher} must not try to
 * match into the contents (in the case of matching a reference) or children (in the case of matching an expression) of
 * the given root. Depending on the specific implementation of the root structure, matching against children/members
 * can be quite complicated, so this behavior is implemented by the {@link Bindable#bindTo(ExpressionMatcher)} method
 * instead. An {@code ExpressionMatcher} holds an {@link ExpressionChildrenMatcher} which describes how the children
 * should be matched.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Extreme care should be taken when implementing <code>ExpressionMatcher</code>, since it can be very delicate.
 * In particular, expression matchers may (or may not) be reused between successive rule calls and should be stateless.
 * Additionally, implementors of <code>ExpressionMatcher</code> must use the (default) reference equals.
 * </p>
 * @param <T> the bindable type that this matcher binds to
