/**
 * An {@code ExpressionChildrenMatcher} describes how to match the children of a {@link RelationalExpression} (i.e., the
 * references returned by the {@link RelationalExpression#getQuantifiers()} method). Bindings can be
 * retrieved from the rule call using the {@code ExpressionChildMatcher} that produced them.
 *
 * <p>
 * In most cases, the most natural way to bind to the children of a planner expression is by defining a matcher for each
 * child. This behavior is implemented in the {@link ListChildrenMatcher} and exposed by the
 * {@link TypeMatcher#of(Class, ExpressionMatcher[])} helper method. However, this does not work when there is no
 * <i>a priori</i> bound on the number of children returned by {@link RelationalExpression#getQuantifiers()}
 * For example, an {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.query.expressions.AndComponent} can have an arbitrary number of
 * other {@code QueryComponent}s as children.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that an {@code ExpressionChildrenMatcher} should generally only define how to distribute children to one or more
 * child matchers, and that these child matchers should generally match to the children themselves. For example, see
 * the implementation of {@link ListChildrenMatcher}. Extreme care should be taken when implementing an
 * {@code ExpressionChildrenMatcher}. In particular, expression matchers may (or may not) be reused between successive
 * rule calls and should be stateless. Additionally, implementors of <code>ExpressionMatcher</code> must use the
 * (default) reference {@code equals()} method.
 * </p>
