/**
 * A relational planner expression that represents an unimplemented sort on the records produced by its inner
 * relational planner expression.
 *
 * TODO BEGIN
 * This class is somewhat flawed. There is a cousin of this class {@link LogicalSortExpression} which serves a similar
 * purpose conceptually but is still technically quite different. {@link LogicalSortExpression} serves as the logical
 * precursor to a physical implementation of a sort (which we do not (yet) have). So in order for the planner to produce
 * an executable plan, that sort expression has to be optimized away by e.g. {@link RemoveSortRule}. This class
 * is different in a way that it an only be used as an expression to be matched against. In other words this class is
 * only ever allowed to appear in a match candidate on the expression side. The reason why that is comes down to the
 * simple question of how to express the thing(s) to sort on in general and what to do with nested repeated value in
 * particular.
 *
 * What should we be able to express when we express order? One thing we definitely want to sort by is a scalar
 * value that can be computed from the record or an index key that flows into the operator. On the contrary we should
 * not be able to sort by something like {@code field("a", FanOut)} as it really does not make sense
 * in this context. What does make sense is to say that you want the stream to be ordered by {@code field("a", FanOut)},
 * but you actually are expressing a requirement on data computed on a record before it even flows into the sort, i.e.
 * it cannot be computed (conceptually) in this operator. The nested repeated field {@code a} needs to come from either
 * a physical version of an {@link ExplodeExpression} (which we don't have (yet)) or from an index access as index keys
 * can be constructed in this way. The expressiveness that is fundamentally lacking here is to model what data flows,
 * how it flows and what operations have been applied to it since it was generated. There are other places where exactly
 * this is a problem as well. Specifically, for the sort expression, however, this problem manifests itself as:
 *
 * (1) Either the sort is expressed by using {@link KeyExpression}s. In that case, expressing a nested repeated value
 *     in the sort expression itself does not make sense. Again, we should model such a case as a sort over an value
 *     that has been pre-produced by a cardinality-changing operator such as a physical variant of explode or by
 *     explicitly referring to and modelling the index keys that can flow along with the fetched record. Note that this
 *     of course has far-reaching implications for optimizations that attempt to defer the fetch of a record.
 *     Essentially, we would like to say
 *
 *     <pre>
 *     index: {@code field(a, FanOut)}
 *     plan: {@code Sort(IndexScan(index), a [5, 10]), indexkey.a)}
 *     </pre>
 *
 *     i.e. we want to sort by the index key. We do not want to model that plan like
 *     <pre>
 *     plan: {@code Sort(IndexScan(index), a [5, 10]), record.field("a", FanOut))}
 *     </pre>
 *
 *     where the sort expression (even only if conceptually) extracts the {@code a}s from the base records as the base
 *     record at that moment already may contain duplicates of the base record due to using that index in the underlying
 *     scan.
 * (2) Alternatively, we can express the sort by using explicit index scan-provided values. You simply cannot sort by
 *     anything that does not come from an index or a primary scan (the latter cannot really sort by anything that's
 *     repeated due to the key being a primary key). That works for the current landscape as there is no physical sort
 *     (yet) and it overcomes the problem explained above in a way that we can express to sort by anything the
 *     index scan (or primary scan) produces as opposed to something that can be computed on-the-fly based upon the
 *     base record. This also removes the requirement of the base record to be fetched and present at the the time the
 *     sort happens (conceptually) and allows for deferred-fetch optimizations.
 *
 * As a direct result of this we now have two different logical sort expressions. One, {@link LogicalSortExpression}
 * which expresses order by using {@link KeyExpression}s and which has the problems layed out in (1), and  one
 * {@link MatchableSortExpression} which expresses order by explicitly naming the constituent parts of an index.
 * In the future, we should strive to unify these two classes to one logical sort expression. For now, we have
 * a logical sort expression ({@link LogicalSortExpression}) on the query side and a matchable sort expression
 * ({@link MatchableSortExpression}) on the match candidate side.
 * TODO END
 *
 * When it comes to matching this class does not (yet) subsume a {@link LogicalSortExpression} although it probably
 * should be able to just for orthogonality of how rules can be applied and the search space for transformations
 * and matching is explored. As an expression of this class never transforms into a physical sort (even if
 * we had one, this expression would not be transformed into a a physical operator). In a sense this expression
 * expresses a property of the flowing data stream (which ultimately comes from an ordered scan). This property
 * is picked up by {@link AdjustMatchRule} meaning that this operator can match "in-between" expressions on the query
 * expression side (homomorphic matching) by improving the existing match memo by adorning it using the correct order-by
 * property.
