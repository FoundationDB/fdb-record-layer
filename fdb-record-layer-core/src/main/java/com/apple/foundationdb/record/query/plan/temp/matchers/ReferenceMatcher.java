/**
 * An expression matcher that matches against any reference at all. It is frequently used by rules that want to capture
 * everything behind a reference without regard for its content. The bindings generated by a {@code ReferenceMatcher}
 * do not provide any access to what was matched. However, the references from the binding can be used when constructing
 * new planner expressions to yield to the planner, which is especially efficient when the references are groups.
 *
 * Although the {@code ReferenceMatcher} has a type parameter, it cannot statically verify that the type of {@link PlannerExpression}
 * behind a reference actually matches its type parameter, because of type erasure. It is up to the programmer to verify
 * that the type parameter is general enough to cover every possible type of {@code PlannerExpression} that might be behind
 * any reference that it could be matched to. In general, the programmer will be certain that a reference would contain
 * a particular type because an expression of a certain type is always found in a particular position of the iterator
 * returned by {@link PlannerExpression#getPlannerExpressionChildren()}. For example, it would be safe to use a
 * {@code ReferenceMatcher<QueryComponent>} to match against the second planner expression child of a
 * {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.query.plan.plans.RecordQueryFilterPlan} because that child is necessarily a
 * {@code QueryComponent}; note that there is no way for the type system to know that, so the programmer must track
 * such information when writing rules. If the wrong type is used for the type parameter, the {@link PlannerBindings}
 * will throw a {@link ClassCastException}.
 * @param <T> the type of planner expression that this matcher will always bind to
