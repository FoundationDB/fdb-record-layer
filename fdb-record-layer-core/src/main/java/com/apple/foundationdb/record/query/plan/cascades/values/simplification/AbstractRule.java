/**
 * The rule matching occurs in two stages: first, the planner examines the {@link #matcher} of the rule,
 * which is a {@link BindingMatcher} expression that expresses the operators that the rule applies to and the hierarchical
 * structure that they take on in the expression tree. If the rule matches the binding, its {@link #onMatch(PlannerRuleCall)}
 * method is called, with a parameter that provides the planner's {@link PlanContext} and access to the map of bindings,
 * among other things. This method can inspect the operators bound during the structural matching and implement other
 * logic.
 * <br>
 * The <code>onMatch()</code> method returns logically equivalent expressions to the planner by calling the
 * {@link PlannerRuleCall#yield(Object)} method on its rule call, with a new
 * {@link ExpressionRef}. The <code>yield()</code> method can be called more than once, or zero times if no
 * alternative expressions are found.
 * <br>
 * A rule should not attempt to modify any of the bound objects that the rule call provides. Nearly all such objects are
 * immutable, and the mutable ones are hidden behind interfaces that do not expose mutation methods. In particular,
 * a rule should never cast an {@link ExpressionRef} in an attempt to access it.
 * <br>
 * A rule should not store state between successive calls to {@link #onMatch(PlannerRuleCall)},
 * since it may be reused an arbitrary number of times and may be re-instantiated at any time. To simplify cleanup,
 * any state that needs to be shared within a rule call should be encapsulated in a helper object (such as a static
 * inner class) or documented carefully.
 *
 * @param <RESULT> the type of the result being yielded by rule implementations
 * @param <CALL> the type of rule call that is used in calls to {@link #onMatch(PlannerRuleCall)} )}
 * @param <BASE> the type of entity the rule matches
 * @param <TYPE> a type of specific subtype that this rule matches
