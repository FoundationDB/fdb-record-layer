/**
 * An interface for certain Cascades-style properties, which are measurable features of an expression other than the
 * structure of the expression tree. In particular, a {@code PlannerProperty} is a property that depends on (much of)
 * the contents of the subtree rooted at the expression on which it is evaluated, rather than just a finite depth set
 * of paths as a {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.query.plan.temp.matchers.ExpressionMatcher} would. For example,
 * the sort order and set of record types produced by a
 * {@link RelationalExpression} could be a
 * {@code PlannerProperty}.
 *
 * <p>
 * To avoid littering {@link RelationalExpression} classes with methods for various properties, properties are implemented
 * using a variant of the hierarchical visitor pattern the tree of {@code PlannerExpression}s and {@link ExpressionRef}s.
 * A property can be evaluated against an expression tree by having the visitor traverse the tree. Note that the
 * "{@code visitLeave()}" methods {@link #evaluateAtExpression} and {@link #evaluateAtRef} are handed the results of the
 * visitor evaluated at their children and members respectively. Since most properties are easy to describe as a
 * recursion with depth one, this makes properties easier to read and write.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> the result type of the property
