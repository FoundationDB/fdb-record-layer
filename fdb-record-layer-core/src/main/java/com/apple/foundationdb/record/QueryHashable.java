/**
 * Query hash - calculate and return identifying hash values for queries.
 * The queryHash semantics are different than {@link Object#hashCode} in a few ways:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>{@link #queryHash} values should be stable across runtime instance changes. The reason is that these values are going to be used
 *     to correlate queries with plans across multiple instances, and so need to be repeatable and stable.</LI>
 *     <LI>{@link #queryHash} supports multiple flavors of hash calculations (See {@link QueryHashKind}). The various kinds of hash values
 *     are used for different purposes and include/exclude different parts of the target query</LI>
 *     <LI>{@link #queryHash} is meant to imply a certain identity of a query, and reflects on the entire structure of the query.
 *     The intent is to be able to correlate various queries for "identity" (using different definitions for this identity as
 *     specified by {@link QueryHashKind}). This requirement drives a desire to reduce collisions as much as possible since
 *     not in all cases can we actually use "equals" to verify identity (e.g. log messages)</LI>
 * </UL>
