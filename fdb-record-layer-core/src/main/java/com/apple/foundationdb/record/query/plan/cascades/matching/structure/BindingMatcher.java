/**
 * A binding matcher is an object that can be matched against a complex object tree, while binding certain
 * references in the tree to matcher objects. The bindings can be retrieved from the {@link PlannerBindings} once one
 * or more bindings are established.
 *
 * Extreme care should be taken when implementing binding matchers, since it can be very delicate.
 * In particular, binding matchers may (or may not) be reused between successive rule calls and should be stateless.
 * Additionally, implementors must use the (default) reference equals for any binding matcher as the
 * class {@link PlannerBindings} keeps an association between a matcher and the matched object(s) in a
 * multimap.
 * @param <T> the type that this matcher binds to
