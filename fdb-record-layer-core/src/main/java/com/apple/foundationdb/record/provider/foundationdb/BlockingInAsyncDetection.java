/**
 * Indicates whether {@link FDBDatabase#asyncToSync(FDBStoreTimer, FDBStoreTimer.Wait, java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture)} or
 * {@link FDBRecordContext#asyncToSync(FDBStoreTimer.Wait, java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture)} should
 * attempt to detect when it is being called from an asynchronous context and, if so, how it should react to
 * this fact.  When this situation is detected, there are two scenarios that need to be dealt with:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Completed future</b> - the future that was to be waited on is completed. In some code, this is
 *       normal expected behavior; some prior logic ensured that the future was completed and subsequent calls
 *       just "know" they won't block.  Of course, it is possible that there is no such logic and the
 *       future was simply accidentally completed.  As a result there are two options for dealing with
 *       the presence of such completed futures: <code>IGNORE_COMPLETE</code> (silently ignore) or
 *       <code>WARN_COMPLETE</code> (log a warning).</li>
 *     <li><b>Non-complete future</b> - the future that was to be waited on is not complete. There is (typically) no
 *       circumstance in which this is acceptable, so the options to react to this scenario are
 *       <code>EXCEPTION_BLOCKING</code> (throw an exception) or <code>WARN_BLOCKING</code> (log a warning).</li>
 * </ul>
