/**
 * A cache for {@link FDBRecordStoreStateCacheEntry} objects. These cache entries contain information necessary
 * to initialize a record store, so caching this information can make accessing a record store multiple times
 * in quick succession cheaper both in that latency is saved at record store creation time. Additionally, in scenarios
 * when a client is connecting to a very small number of record stores, loading this information from disk can
 * load potential hot keys which can generally degrade cluster performance. Caching this information avoids performing
 * those reads.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that if the client is connecting to multiple clusters, there should be one cache per cluster. In general, as
 * there is one {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.provider.foundationdb.FDBDatabase FDBDatabase} object per cluster,
 * it is sufficient to provide a {@link FDBRecordStoreStateCacheFactory} to the
 * {@link FDBDatabaseFactory FDBDatabaseFactory}
 * singleton. One can also provide a cache instance to an {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.provider.foundationdb.FDBRecordStore FDBRecordStore}
 * at build time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Clients should generally not call methods defined on this interface, as they are intended mainly for internal use
 * within the Record Layer.
