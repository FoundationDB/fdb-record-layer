/**
 * The {@link LockRegistry} keeps track of locking over resources in the context of a single transaction. In essence,
 * it maps a resource (by means of a {@link LockIdentifier}) to the latest lock that has been assigned on that resource.
 * <p>
 * The registry can be requested to grant the lock in either the {@code read} mode or the {@code write} mode. The
 * difference between the 2 modes is as follows:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code write}: This mode gives exclusive access over the resource, i.e., no other read or write operation can
 *     happen concurrently when the lock has been granted in the current context.</li>
 *     <li>{@code read}: This mode gives access over the resource that can be shared by other read locks concurrently.
 *     Hence, it is possible to have multiple threads that have read access to the the resource at a time, but no write
 *     can happen at that time.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Example, for a bunch of read and write locks accepted in an arbitrary order given by r1, r2, r3, w1, w2, r4, r5, w3,
 * we can expect r1, r2, r3 to occur concurrently. w1 'waits' for all of r1, r2, r3 to complete, completion of which
 * itself is waited by w2. After w2 is completed, r4 and r5 can run concurrently.
 * <p>
 * There are 2 set of methods to interact with the registry:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code acquire}: {@link LockRegistry#acquireReadLock} and {@link LockRegistry#acquireWriteLock}</li>
 *     <li>{@code do}: {@link LockRegistry#doWithReadLock} and {@link LockRegistry#doWithWriteLock}</li>
 * </ul>
 * For most cases, the {@code do} methods should be preferred. However, the {@code acquire} methods can be useful if the
 * lock needs to outlast the supplied lambda. For instance, for APIs that want to return a cursor over results that
 * retain the lock for the entire duration of a scan, the {@link #acquireReadLock} method can be used in conjunction
 * with an {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.cursors.AsyncLockCursor}.
 * <p>
 * The sample usage with {@code do} method can be:
 * <pre>{@code
 *      final CompletableFuture<Void> task = registry.doWithReadLock(identifier, () -> {
 *          // do your task...
 *      });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * The usage with the {@code acquire} methods is more straight-forward as it returns a {@link CompletableFuture} of the
 * held lock which gets completed after the lock has been granted. This could then be chained to perform required
 * operations and lock management. The thing to take note here, the ownership of the 'granted' lock is returned to the
 * caller, who should most likely keep hold of it for the duration of the operation and ultimately 'releases' it when
 * done. An illustrative example:
 * <pre>{@code
 *      final AtomicReference<AsyncLock> lockRef = new AtomicReference<>();
 *      final CompletableFuture<Void> lock = registry.acquireWithReadLock(identifier).thenApply(asyncLock -> {
 *          // persist the lock
 *          lockRef.set(asyncLock)
 *          // do your task...
 *      }).whenComplete((ignore, error) -> {
 *          lockRef.get().release();
 *      })
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Note that when the task is completed, whether normally or with an exception, the lock is explicitly released.
