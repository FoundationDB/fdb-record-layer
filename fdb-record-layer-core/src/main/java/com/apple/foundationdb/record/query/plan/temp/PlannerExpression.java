/**
 * The basic type that represents a part of the planner expression tree. An expression is generally an immutable
 * object with two different kinds of fields: regular Java fields and reference fields. The regular fields represent
 * "node information", which pertains only to this specific node in the tree. In contrast, the reference fields represent
 * this expression's children in the tree, such as its inputs and filter/sort expressions, and are always hidden behind
 * an {@link ExpressionRef}.
 *
 * Deciding whether certain fields constitute "node information" (and should therefore be a regular field) or
 * "hierarchical information" (and therefore should not be) is subtle and more of an art than a science. There are two
 * reasonable tests that can help make this decision:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>When writing a planner rule to manipulate this field, does it make sense to match it separately
 *     or access it as a getter on the matched operator? Will you ever want to match to just this field?</li>
 *     <li>Should the planner memoize (and therefore optimize) this field separately from its parent?</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * For example, {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.query.plan.plans.RecordQueryIndexPlan} has only regular fields, including the
 * index name and the comparisons to use when scanning it.
 * Applying the first rule, it wouldn't really make sense to match the index name or the comparisons being performed on
 * their own: they're what define an index scan, after all!
 * Applying the second rule, they're relatively small immutable objects that don't need to be memoized.
 *
 * In contrast, {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.query.plan.plans.RecordQueryFilterPlan} has no regular fields.
 * A filter plan has two important fields: the <code>Query.Component</code> used for the filter and a child plan that
 * provides input. Both of these might be matched by rules directly, in order to optimize them without regard for the
 * fact that there's a filter. Similarly, they should both be memoized separately, since there might be many possible
 * implementations of each.
