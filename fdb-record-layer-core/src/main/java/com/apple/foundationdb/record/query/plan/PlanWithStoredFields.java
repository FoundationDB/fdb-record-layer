/**
 * A plan that has some, but not all, stored fields.
 *
 * Used by {@link AvailableFields#fromIndex} for an index type that appears in {@link PlannableIndexTypes#getUnstoredNonPrimaryKeyTypes()}
 * to determine which of the fields found in the index's definition actually appear in its index entries.
 * By default, only the primary key and any grouping key are assumed to be there.
 *
 * Note that this is about the fields of the index entries scanned by the plan <em>before</em> it fetches the base record
 * (or not if the covering optimization is applied).
 * Contrast this with {@link com.apple.foundationdb.record.query.plan.plans.RecordQueryPlan#getAvailableFields},
 * which exposes the fields available from plan if run as is, that is, with the implied base record fetch.
