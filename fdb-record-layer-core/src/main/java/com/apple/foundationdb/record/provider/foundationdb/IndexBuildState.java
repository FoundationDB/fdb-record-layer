/**
 * A class that contains the build progress of a given index in a given record store.
 * <p>
 * It first contains {@link IndexState}. If the state is {@link IndexState#WRITE_ONLY}, it will also contain the number
 * of records scanned and the estimated total number of records that need to be scanned.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that index build state (especially records scanned) serves an informational purpose only as the number of
 * records scanned is not necessarily 100% of records in total when the index build completes for several reasons:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li> If the {@link OnlineIndexer} has been configured to disable tracking progress (by setting
 *     {@link OnlineIndexer.Builder#setTrackProgress(boolean)} to {@code false}), then {@link #getRecordsScanned()} will
 *     not include the records scanned by that {@link OnlineIndexer}. </li>
 *     <li> Records added or deleted during the index build progress are not included in records scanned but are in
 *     records in total. </li>
 *     <li> Records in total uses the number of all records in the store. In some cases, the real number of records
 *     that need to be scanned is less than this.</li>
