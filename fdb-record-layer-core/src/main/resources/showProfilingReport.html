      Some Notes
      <ul>
        <li>This report was generated by utilizing <code>Debugger.Event</code> that the planner generated.</li>
        <li>Event profiling gives an overview over time spent with respect to general planner infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Planner rule profiling gives an overview over time spent with respect to specific rules invoked by the planner.</li>
        <li>All items not listing out times are invoked by the planner with a specific <code>Location</code>. These events are just counted.</li>
        <li>All items listing out times are invoked by the planner with location called <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code>.
          These events are always sent in pairs. The time displayed is accumulated time spent between an occurrence of <code>BEGIN</code>
          and its corresponding <code>END</code> event.
        </li>
        <li>As <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> events can be nested we make a distinction between total time and own time which is akin to what normal profilers offer.
          Here are some known nestings:
          <ul>
            <li>All rules times add up to the times in <code>TransformRuleCallEvent</code> .</li>
            <li><code>TransformRuleCallEvent</code> nests within <code>TransformEvent</code>. This corresponds to trying all possible pre-patterns on a rule. The rule is then invoked per matching pre-pattern.</li>
            <li><code>InsertIntoMemoEvent</code> nests within <code>TransformRuleCallEvent</code>. This also means that the time spent to insert into the memo structure is subtracted from the own times of all planner rules.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
