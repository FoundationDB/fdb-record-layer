    <!-- Classes with errors thrown in the constructor can mean we have a partially constructed class in a finalizer (of a subclass as none of our classes use finalizers).
       Ideally, we'd protect ourselves from this, either by changing the constructor so that it can't throw or by marking the class as final, but there are a few too many
       classes in this state right now. -->
