# Release Notes

This document contains a log of changes to the FoundationDB Record Layer. It aims to include mostly user-visible changes or improvements. Within each minor release, larger or more involved changes are highlighted first before detailing the changes that were included in each build or patch version. Users should especially take note of any breaking changes or special upgrade instructions which should always be included as a preface to the minor version as a whole before looking at changes at a version-by-version level.

As the [versioning guide](Versioning.md) details, it cannot always be determined solely by looking at the version numbers whether one Record Layer version contains all changes included in another. In particular, bug fixes and backwards-compatible changes might be back-ported to or introduced as patches against older versions. To track when a patch version has been included in the main release train, some releases will say as a note that they contain all changes from a specific patch.

## 3.4

### Breaking Changes

Support for the Protobuf 2 runtime has been removed as of this version. All artifacts now use Protobuf version 3. Note that the choice of Protobuf runtime version is distinct from the choice of Protobuf message syntax, and that users wishing to retain Protobuf 2 behavior can still achieve the same semantics (including [optional field behavior]()) as long as they specify the syntax on their Protobuf file as `proto2`. Note that the Maven artifacts using Protobuf version 3 used to be suffixed with `-pb3`. Existing Protobuf 3 users must remove that suffix from their dependency declarations (e.g., `fdb-record-layer-core-pb3` should now be `fdb-record-layer-core`).

Starting with version [3.4.455.0](#344550), the semantics of `UnnestedRecordType` were changed in response to [Issue #2512](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/2512). It was identified that extraneous synthetic records were being produced when one of the children was empty. This did not match the semantics of `FanOut` expressions, and so the unnesting calculation was changed. This means that any index on an existing `UnnestedRecordType` requires rebuilding to clear out any such entries from older indexes.

## 3.2

### Features

This version of the Record Layer allows the FDB API version to be configured through the `FDBDatabaseFactory`. This means that while this version allows the client to be configured to use 7.1 features, it also supports connecting to 6.3 FDB clusters if the API version is set appropriately. Note that setting the API version does restrict the set of potential FDB server versions that can be connected to, so this configuration change should only be made if the FDB server has already been updated.
 
New index state "READABLE_UNIQUE_PENDING" - the proper way to roll this feature out is: 
1. The adopter should upgrade to the new Record Layer version and deploy the version everywhere.
2. The format version should be set READABLE_UNIQUE_PENDING_FORMAT_VERSION.
3. Only after all the possible clients are upgraded to support the new state, the adopter may set the allowPendingState on the indexing policy of new index builds. 
An index may be in this new state if it is fully built, the unique flag is set, and duplications were found during online indexing. From the code point of view, it is defined as scannable but not readable.  


### Breaking Changes

The FoundationDB Java binding dependency has been updated to 7.1 with this release. This means that clients also need to update their main FDB C client to a 7.1 version. Adopters that still wish to connect to an FDB cluster running a 6.3 or 7.0 server version can do so by packaging additional FDB C clients at the appropriate version(s) using the [FDB multi-version client feature](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/api-general.html#multi-version-client).

This release also updates downstream dependency versions. Most notably, the proto3 artifacts now require Protobuf version 3.20.1.

## 3.0

### Breaking Changes

This version of the Record Layer removes some legacy elements of the API that were deprecated in previous releases. Most notably, it removes the methods on the `RecordCursor` interface that were compatible with Java `Iterator`s. That API was deprecated in version [2.6](#26) to make it easier for adopters to reason about continuations in asynchronous code by associating each value returned by the cursor with that value's continuation. Adopters still using the deprecated API can either use the `onNext()` and `getNext()` methods on the `RecordCursor` interface or call `asIterator()` to get a `RecordCursorIterator`, which retains compatibility with the `Iterator` interface.

Another, smaller change that has been made is that by default, new indexes added to existing stores (that cannot be built in-line) are now initialized with a `DISABLED` `IndexState` whereas the index used default to a `WRITE_ONLY` state. This means that any records written to the record store prior to the index being built will not perform any I/O to update the index, which is effectively wasted work. However, all indexes must be put in the `WRITE_ONLY` state while they are being built in order to ensure that any updates to the index during the build are captured. This is something that the `OnlineIndexer` should be able to handle automatically for most users, but users of the `ERROR_IF_DISABLED_CONTINUE_IF_WRITE_ONLY` index state precondition may start seeing additional `RecordCoreStorageException`s with the message "Attempted to build non-write-only index" when attempting to build an index. That `IndexStatePrecondition` is not reccommended, however, and users should switch over to using a different `IndexStatePrecondition` (like the default index state precondition, `BUILD_IF_DISABLED_CONTINUE_IF_WRITE_ONLY`) instead or explicitly set the index state on the index to `WRITE_ONLY` prior to building the index. Users can also replicate the old behavior by supplying a `UserVersionChecker` implementation with an appropriate implementation of `needRebuildIndex` to the `FDBRecordStore.Builder`.

### Breaking Changes

In this release, the various implementations of the `RecordQueryPlan` interface have  moved to API stability level `INTERNAL`. This means that individual implementations may change without notice. Clients that are not creating `RecordQueryPlan` objects directly (but instead using the planner to create plans) should not be affected.

## 2.9

### Breaking Changes

This version of the Record Layer requires a FoundationDB server version of at least version 6.2. Attempting to connect to older versions may result in the client hanging when attempting to connect to the database.

Additionally, builds for the project now require JDK 11. The project is still targetting JDK 1.8 for both source and binary compatibility, so projects importing the library that have not yet upgraded to the newer JDK should still be able to import the project as before, but developers may need to update their local development environment if they have not already done so.

`FDBRecordStore` does not have `addUniquenessCheck` anymore, which is replaced by `checkUniqueness` in `StandardIndexMaintainer` now; `IndexMaintainer` does not have `updateUniquenessViolations` anymore, which is replaced by `addUniquenessViolation` and `removeUniquenessViolationsAsync` in `StandardIndexMaintainer` now; `StandardIndexMaintainer` now has `updateOneKeyAsync` in place of `updateOneKey` .

`OrElseCursor` now uses a structured continuation instead of the previous pass-through style. This breaks the continuations of all `OrElseCursor`s from previous builds. Furthermore, the fluent `RecordCursor.orElse()` method is deprecated in favor of a static method that also takes a continuation.

### 2.9.134.0

* **Breaking change** Methods interacting with the local version cache on an `FDBRecordContext` have been removed as they were previously unsafe and should have been internal only [(Issue #952)](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/952)
* **Breaking change** `OrElseCursor` has a new continuation format that is incompatible with the previous continuation format [(Issue #974)](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/974)
* **Breaking change** Guava and protobuf dependency versions have been upgraded to 29.0 and 3.12.2 respectively [(Issue #967)](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/967)

## 2.8

### Features

The `FDBRecordStore` can now use the global meta-data key that was added to FoundationDB in version 6.1 to cache state that otherwise must be read from the database at store initialization time. When opening any record store, the user can supply an instance of the new `MetaDataVersionStampStoreStateCache` class. (Alternatively, the `FDBDatabase` can be configured with a `MetaDataVersionStampStoreStateCache` that will be shared by all record stores opened using that database.) This class uses the value of the cluster's global meta-data key to detect if cache entries are stale, and it will invalidate older entries whenever the value of that key changes.

This cache invalidation strategy is safe as record stores can now be configured to update the global meta-data version key whenever any of the cached information is changed. To do so, the user must configure their record store to have cacheable meta-data by calling `setStoreStateCacheability(true)`. The record store will then update the global meta-data key whenever the cached state changes. If the record store has not been so configured, then the `MetaDataVersionStampStoreStateCache` will *not* cache the store initialization information in memory, so opening the store will require re-reading this information from the database each time the store is opened.

If the client is only accessing a small number of record stores on each cluster, then using the `MetaDataVersionStampStoreStateCache` can speed up record store initialization time as most record stores should now be able to be opened without reading anything from the database. Additionally, enabling this feature can help with users facing scalability problems on large record stores if loading this information at store creation time becomes a performance bottleneck. However, note that if there are many record stores coexisting on the same cluster, enabling this feature on all record stores may cause the meta-data key to change with high frequency, and it can degrage the effectiveness of the cache. Users are therefore encouraged to consider carefully which record stores require this feature and which ones do not before enabling it.

Additionally, each record store now allows users to set custom fields in the store header. For background, every record store includes one extra message stored in a special location with extra information about the record store that the Record Layer uses to control behavior when manipulating that record store. For example, it includes the version of the `RecordMetaData` that was used the last time the record store was accessed. The header is then read every time a record store is opened, and then it can be used to detect if, for example, the meta-data verion has changed and new index builds need to be scheduled. (There are also ways of caching this information in a way that is transactionally consistent with the Record Store itself to avoid creating a performance bottleneck. See: [Issue #537](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/537).) The new feature adds a mechanism for the user to set those fields with data that the user may want to update transactionally with the data but that they do not want to pay the cost of performing an additional read against the database with every operation. For example, sample use cases might include:

* Adding a flag to indicate whether a migration of data from an older record type to a newer type has completed, and then using this flag to control whether the old record type or the new record type is queried.
* Information about the history of the data in the record store, such as how many times the data have been copied between different FoundationDB clusters.
* Frequently read data like custom application-speicific options that might differ between different record stores.

Importantly, it is rather expensive to write this data (as all concurrent operations to the record store will fail with a conflict), and as the data in these fields are read with every transaction, it is not advised that the user write to these fields too often or store too much data in them. However, if there is a relatively small amount of data with a very low write-rate, it might be appropriate to use this feature. This feature also requires that the user set the format version for a record store to [`HEADER_USER_FIELDS_FORMAT_VERSION`](https://javadoc.io/page/org.foundationdb/fdb-record-layer-core/latest/com/apple/foundationdb/record/provider/foundationdb/FDBRecordStore.html#HEADER_USER_FIELDS_FORMAT_VERSION). The default format version was not updated to that version.

A client can now specify a custom `IndexQueryabilityFilter` that determines which indexes should be considered by the query planner.

### Breaking Changes

A new format version, [`CACHEABLE_STATE_FORMAT_VERSION`](https://javadoc.io/page/org.foundationdb/fdb-record-layer-core/latest/com/apple/foundationdb/record/provider/foundationdb/FDBRecordStore.html#CACHEABLE_STATE_FORMAT_VERSION), was introduced in this version of the Record Layer. Users who wish to experience zero downtime when upgrading from earlier versions should initialize all record stores to the previous maximum format version, [`SAVE_VERSION_WITH_RECORD_FORMAT_VERSION`](https://javadoc.io/page/org.foundationdb/fdb-record-layer-core/latest/com/apple/foundationdb/record/provider/foundationdb/FDBRecordStore.html#SAVE_VERSION_WITH_RECORD_FORMAT_VERSION), until all clients have been upgraded to version 2.8. If the update is done without this measure, then older clients running 2.7 or older will not be able to read from any record stores written using version 2.8. The new format version is also required to use the new `MetaDataVersionStampStoreStateCache` class to cache a record store's initialization state.

This version of the Record Layer requires a FoundationDB server version of at least version 6.1. Attempting to connect to older versions may result in the client hanging when attempting to connect to the database.

Constructors of the `RecordQueryUnionPlan` and `RecordQueryIntersectionPlan` have been marked as deprecated in favor of static initializers. This will allow for more flexibility as work on the new planner develops.

### Newly Deprecated 

The non-static `RecordCursor::flatMapPipelined()` method has been deprecated because it is easy to mis-use (by mistaken analogy to the `mapPipelined()` method) and cannot be used with continuations. See [Issue #665](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/665) for further explanation.

The `FDBDatabase::getReadVersion()` method has been replaced with the `FDBRecordContext::getReadVersionAsync()` and `FDBRecordContext::getReadVersion()` methods. Though not strictly necessary, users should also replace any uses of `Transaction::getReadVersion()` and `Transaction::setReadVersion()` (on the `Transaction` interface provided by the FoundationDB Java bindings) with `FDBRecordContext::getReadVersionAsync()` and `FDBRecordContext::setReadVersion()` on any transactions created by the Record Layer. This allows the Record Layer to track the version in Java memory which both can then be used to skip a JNI hop if the read version is needed, but it also allows the Record Layer to more accurately track when read versions are retrieved from the database if the user has enabled read version tracking.

## 2.6

### Breaking Changes

The formerly experimental API for advancing a `RecordCursor` while ensuring correct continuation handling is now preferred. Specifically, the `RecordCursor.onNext()` method is now stable. Meanwhile, the `AsyncIterator`-style methods (such as `onHasNext()`, `hasNext()`, and `next()`) are deprecated. Clients should transition away from these methods before the 2.7 release.

To ease the transition, a new `AsyncIterator` called `RecordCursorIterator` provides these method and can built form a `RecordCursor` using `RecordCursor.asIterator()`.

The `IndexEntry` class now contains a reference to its source index. This meant breaking the constructor on that class. This class should probably only have been instantiated from within the Record Layer, so its old constructors have been removed, and the new constructors are now marked as [`INTERNAL`](https://javadoc.io/page/org.foundationdb/fdb-extensions/latest/com/apple/foundationdb/annotation/API.Status.html#INTERNAL).

The API stability annotations have been moved to their own package. This allows for references to the stability levels within Javadoc pages to link to the annotation documentation. Any external users who had also used these annotations will be required to modify their imports to match the new package. Because these annotations have `CLASS` retention level, this change also requires that any client who depends on the Record Layer update any transitive dependency on `fdb-extensions` to 2.6 to avoid compile-time warnings about missing annotation classes.

The `IndexMaintainer` class now has a new public method `validateEntries`. Subclasses inheriting it should implement the new method. It does not break classes extending `StandardIndexMaintainer` which has a default implementation that does nothing.

The `SubspaceProvider` interface is changed to no longer require an `FDBRecordContext` at construction. Instead, methods that resolve subspaces are directly provided with an `FDBRecordContext`. This provides implementations with the flexibility to resolve logical subspace representations against different FoundationDB backends.

This version of the Record Layer requires a FoundationDB server version of at least version 6.0. Attempting to connect to older versions may result in the client hanging when attempting to connect to the database.

The `getTimeToLoad` and `getTimeToDeserialize` methods on `FDBStoredRecord` have been removed. These were needed for a short-term experiment but stuck around longer than intended.

### Newly Deprecated

Methods for retrieving a record from a record store based on an index entry generally took both an index and an index entry. As index entries now store a reference to their associatedindex, these methods have been deprecated in favor of methods that only take an index entry. The earlier methods may be removed in a future release. The same is true for a constructor on `FDBIndexedRecord` which no longer needs to take both an index and an index entry.

While not deprecated, the [`MetaDataCache`](https://javadoc.io/page/org.foundationdb/fdb-record-layer-core/latest/com/apple/foundationdb/record/provider/foundationdb/MetaDataCache.html) interface's stability has been lessened from [`MAINTAINED`](https://javadoc.io/page/org.foundationdb/fdb-extensions/latest/com/apple/foundationdb/annotation/API.Status.html#MAINTAINED) to [`EXPERIMENTAL`](https://javadoc.io/page/org.foundationdb/fdb-extensions/latest/com/apple/foundationdb/annotation/API.Status.html#EXPERIMENTAL). That interface may undergo further changes as work progresses on [Issue #280](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/280). Clients are discouraged from using that interface until work evolving that API has progressed.

The static `loadRecordStoreStateAsync` methods on `FDBRecordStore` were deprecated in 2.6.61.0 and removed in 2.6.66.0. Users are encouraged to use `getRecordStoreState` instead.

The `RecordStoreState` constructors have been deprecated or marked [`INTERNAL`](https://javadoc.io/page/org.foundationdb/fdb-extensions/latest/com/apple/foundationdb/annotation/API.Status.html#INTERNAL) as part of the work adding store state caching ([Issue #410](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/410)). They are likely to be further updated as more meta-data is added to the information stored on indexes within each record store ([Issue #506](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/506)).

## 2.5

### Breaking Changes

In order to simplify typed record stores, the `FDBRecordStoreBase` class was turned into an interface and all I/O was placed in the `FDBRecordStore` class. This makes the `FDBTypedRecordStore` serve as only a type-safe wrapper around the `FDBRecordStore` class. As part of this work, the `IndexMaintainer` interface and its implementations lost their type parameters and now only interact with `Message` types, and the `OnlineIndexerBase` class was removed. Additionally, the `FDBEvaluationContext` class was removed in favor of using `EvaluationContext` (without a type parameter) directly. That class also no longer carries around an `FDBRecordStore` reference, so query plans now require an explicit record store in addition to an evaluation context. Finally, the `evaluate` family of methods on key expressions no longer take evaluation contexts. Users should switch any uses of the `OnlineIndexerBase` to a generic `OnlineIndexer` and will need to update any explicit key expression evluation calls. Users should also switch from calling `RecordQueryPlan::execute` to calling `FDBRecordStore::executeQuery` if possible as that second API is more stable (and was not changed as part of the recent work).

### Newly Deprecated

The `asyncToSync` method of the `OnlineIndexer` has been marked as `INTERNAL`. Users should transition to using one of the `asyncToSync` methods defined on either `FDBDatabase`, `FDBRecordContext`, or `FDBDatabaseRunner`. This method may be removed from our public API in a later release (see [Issue # 473](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/473)).

## 2.4

### Features

The `RecordCursor` API has been reworked to make using continuations safer and less error prone as well as generally making safer use easier. Previously, a continuation could be retrieved from a `RecordCursor` by calling the `getContinuation` method. However, this method was only legal to call at certain times which made it painful and error-prone to use in asynchronous contexts. (Similar problems existed with the `getNoNextReason` method.) The new API is designed to make correct use more natural. Users are now encouraged to access elements through the new `onNext` method. This method returns the next element of the cursor if one exists or a reason why the cursor cannot return an element if it cannot. It also will always return a valid continuation that can be used to resume the cursor. As the `RecordCursor` interface is fairly fundamental to using the Record Layer, the old API has not yet been deprecated.

### Breaking Changes

The `GlobalDirectoryResolverFactory` class was removed. This is part of a larger effort to migrate away from the `ScopedDirectoryLayer` class in favor of the `ExtendedDirectoryLayer` class when resolving `DirectoryLayerDirectories` as part of a record store's `KeySpacePath`. Users can still access the global directory layer by calling `ExtendedDirectoryLayer.global()`.

The version of the Protocol Buffers dependency was updated to 2.5.0 and 3.6.1 for artifacts declaring proto2 and proto3 dependencies respectively. While the on-disk format of those versions is backwards-compatible with prior versions, the generated Java files may differ in incompatible ways. Users may therefore need to update their own Protocol Buffer dependencies to the new versions and regenerate any generated Java files created using prior versions.

### Newly Deprecated

The `KeySpacePath` class previously required an `FDBRecordContext` at object creation time. This was used to then resolve certain elements of the path and replace them with interned integers stored by the directory layer within the FoundationDB cluster. However, this meant that a `KeySpacePath` could not outlive a single transaction and therefore could not be reused when connecting to the same record store multiple times. To address this, `KeySpacePath`s should now be constructed without a transaction context, and new methods that do take an `FDBRecordContext` should be used to resolve a path into a subspace or tuple. The older constructor and methods have been deprecated.

Several constructors of the `RecordMetaDataBuilder` class have been deprecated. Users should transition to calling `RecordMetaData.newBuilder()` instead and calling the appropriate setter methods to specify the record descriptor or `MetaData` proto message. This new pattern allows for additional control as to which transitive dependencies of the record file descriptor are serialized into `MetaData` proto message as well as allowing for additional optional parameters to be added in the future in a backwards-compatible way.

### 2.4.36.0

* **Feature** A new RecordCursor API makes continuations less error-prone and safe use easier [(Issue #109)](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/109)
* All changes from version [2.4.35.11](#243511)

### 2.4.35.12

* **Bug fix** The visibility of the `PathValue` class has been increased to `public` to match the visibility of the `resolveAsync` method of `KeySpacePath` [(Issue #266)](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/issues/266)

## 2.3

### Features

The behavior of creating a new record store and opening it with the `createOrOpen` method has been made safer in this version. Previously, a record store that had not been properly initialized may be missing header information describing, for example, what meta-data and format version was used when the store was last opened. This meant that during format version upgrades, a store might be upgraded to a newer format version without going through the proper upgrade procedure. By default, `createOrOpen` now will throw an error if it finds a record store with data but no header, which is indicative of this kind of error. This should protect users from then writing corrupt data to the store and more easily detect these kinds of inconsistencies.

### Breaking Changes

The `OnlineIndexBuilder` has been renamed to the `OnlineIndexer`. This was to accommodate a new builder class for the `OnlineIndexer` as its constructors had become somewhat cumbersome. Users should be able to change the name of that class where referenced and to react to this change.

### Newly Deprecated

As the `Index` class now tracks the created and last modified version separately, the `getVersion` method has been deprecated. Users should switch to using `getAddedVersion` and `getLastModifiedVersion` as appropriate.

## 2.2

### Features

The `FDBRecordStore` class now has additional methods for saving records that can check pre-conditions about whether a record with the same primary key as the new record does or does not already exist in the record store before saving. For example, the `insertRecord` method will throw an error if there is already a record present while `updateRecord` will throw an error if there is not already a record present (or if the type changes). Users are encouraged to switch to these methods to avoid accidentally deleting data if they can reason about whether a record does or does not exist prior to saving it. There are asynchronous variants of all of the new methods, and the existing `saveRecord` method remains available without any changes.

A new query plan, the `RecordQueryUnorderedUnionPlan`, allows the planner to produce union plans with “incompatibly ordered” subplans. In particular, the planner was previously only able of producing a union plan if all of its cursors were guaranteed to return records in the same order. For example, if there were one index on some field `a` of some record type and another on field `b` of that type, then the query planner would produce a union plan if the query were of the form:

```java
Query.or(Query.field("a").equalsValue(value1), Query.field("b").equalsValue(value2))
```

(In particular, it would plan two index scans over the indexes on `a` and `b` and then take their union. Each index scan returned results ordered by the primary key of the records, so the subplans were “compatibly ordered”.)  However, it could *not* handle a query like this with a union:

```java
Query.or(Query.field("a").lessThan(value1), Query.field("b").greaterThan(value2))
```

This would instead result in a plan that scanned the full record store. (In this case, the two candidate index scans would each return records in a different order—one index scan by the value of the field `a` and the other index scan by the value of the field `b`.) The new query plan can handle subplans that return results in any order and essentially returns results as soon as any subplan returns a result. The trade-off is that unlike a `RecordQueryUnionPlan`, the `RecordQueryUnorderedUnionPlan `does *not* remove duplicates. This means that: (1) if the query is run with the `setRemoveDuplicates` flag set to `true` (as it is by default) then there will almost certainly be a `RecordQueryUnorderedPrimaryKeyDistinctPlan` as part of the query plan (which is more memory intensive) and (2) duplicates are never removed across continuation boundaries.

### Breaking Changes

Index options have been refactored into their own class (appropriately titled the `IndexOptions` class). Option names and their semantics were preserved, but users who referenced the options via the constants in the `Index` class should transition their code to reference them through the `IndexOptions` class.

## 2.1

### Features

A new key expression type on the “record type” of a record allows the user to lay their data out in a way that is more akin to the way tables are laid out in a traditional relational database. In particular, if the user prefixes all primary keys with this expression type, then each record type will live in contiguous segments within the database. This can speed up index build times (as only the range containing the records of the corresponding time needs to be scanned) and improve query performance without secondary indexes. As part of this work, the user can specify a shortened “record type key” as part of the record type definition so that the cost is typically only two bytes per key.

The capability and reliability of text queries on more sophisticated indexes has been greatly improved. In particular, it allows for the user to specify queries on a map field that query on the value of portion of the map (when grouped by key) as well as choosing to produce a covering plan if the text index covers all of the required fields of a given query. Queries can also be more reliably combined with other predicates through an “and” or “or” clause.
